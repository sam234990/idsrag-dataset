{"ori_id":"60510bf4be495aeb1b4640a7a058b4ae7c04b884","title":"McTeague","context":"McTeague\n McTeague is a dentist of limited intellect from a poor miner's family, who has opened a dentist shop on Polk Street in San Francisco. (His first name is never revealed; other characters in the novel call him simply \"Mac\".) His best friend, Marcus Schouler, brings his cousin, Trina Sieppe, whom he is courting, to McTeague's parlor for dental work. McTeague becomes infatuated with her while working on her teeth, and Marcus graciously steps aside. McTeague successfully woos Trina. Shortly after McTeague and Trina have kissed and declared their love for each other, Trina discovers that she has won $15,000 from a lottery ticket. In the ensuing celebration Trina's mother, Mrs Sieppe, announces that McTeague and Trina are to marry. Marcus becomes jealous of McTeague, and claims that he has been cheated out of money that would have been rightfully his if he had married Trina.\nThe marriage takes place, and Mrs Sieppe, along with the rest of Trina's family, move away from San Francisco, leaving her alone with McTeague. Trina proves to be a parsimonious wife; she refuses to touch the principal of her $15,000, which she invests with her uncle. She insists that she and McTeague must live on the earnings from McTeague's dental practice, the small income from the $15,000 investment, and the bit of money she earns from carving small wooden figures of Noah's animals and his Ark for sale in her uncle's shop. Secretly, she accumulates penny-pinched savings in a locked trunk. Though the couple are happy, the friendship between Marcus and Mac deteriorates. More than once the two men come to grips; each time McTeague's immense physical strength prevails, and eventually he breaks Marcus' arm in a fight. When Marcus recovers, he goes south, intending to become a rancher; before he leaves, he visits the McTeagues, and he and Mac part apparently as friends.\nCatastrophe strikes when McTeague is debarred from practising dentistry by the authorities; it becomes clear that before leaving, Marcus has taken revenge on Mac by informing city hall that he has no license or degree. McTeague loses his practice and the couple are forced to move into successively poorer quarters as Trina becomes more and more miserly. Their life together deteriorates until McTeague takes all Trina's domestic savings (amounting to $400 or roughly $10,000 in 2010 values) and abandons her. Meanwhile, Trina falls completely under the spell of money and withdraws the principal of her prior winnings in gold from her uncle's firm so she can admire and handle the coins in her room, at one point spreading them over her bed and rolling around in them.\nWhen McTeague returns, destitute once more, she refuses to give him money even for food. Aggravated and made violent by whisky, McTeague beats her to death. He takes the entire hoard of gold and heads out to a mining community that he had left years before. Sensing pursuit, he makes his way south towards Mexico; meanwhile, Marcus hears of the murder and joins the hunt for McTeague, finally catching him in Death Valley. In the middle of the desert Marcus and McTeague fight over McTeague's remaining water and, when that is lost and they are already doomed, over Trina's $15,000. McTeague kills Marcus, but as he dies, Marcus handcuffs himself to McTeague. The final, dramatic image of the novel is one of McTeague stranded, alone and helpless. He is left with only the company of Marcus's corpse, to whom he is handcuffed, in the desolate, arid waste of Death Valley.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of McTeague, by Frank Norris\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

He had a thick gray soup; heavy, underdone meat, very\nhot, on a cold plate; two kinds of vegetables; and a sort of suet\npudding, full of strong butter and sugar. On his way back to his office,\none block above, he stopped at Joe Frenna's saloon and bought a pitcher\nof steam beer. It was his habit to leave the pitcher there on his way to\ndinner.\n\nOnce in his office, or, as he called it on his signboard, \"Dental\nParlors,\" he took off his coat and shoes, unbuttoned his vest, and,\nhaving crammed his little stove full of coke, lay back in his operating\nchair at the bay window, reading the paper, drinking his beer, and\nsmoking his huge porcelain pipe while his food digested; crop-full,\nstupid, and warm. By and by, gorged with steam beer, and overcome by the\nheat of the room, the cheap tobacco, and the effects of his heavy meal,\nhe dropped off to sleep. Late in the afternoon his canary bird, in its\ngilt cage just over his head, began to sing. He woke slowly, finished\nthe rest of his beer--very flat and stale by this time--and taking down\nhis concertina from the bookcase, where in week days it kept the company\nof seven volumes of \"Allen's Practical Dentist,\" played upon it some\nhalf-dozen very mournful airs.\n\nMcTeague looked forward to these Sunday afternoons as a period of\nrelaxation and enjoyment. He invariably spent them in the same fashion.\nThese were his only pleasures--to eat, to smoke, to sleep, and to play\nupon his concertina.\n\nThe six lugubrious airs that he knew, always carried him back to the\ntime when he was a car-boy at the Big Dipper Mine in Placer County, ten\nyears before. He remembered the years he had spent there trundling the\nheavy cars of ore in and out of the tunnel under the direction of his\nfather. For thirteen days of each fortnight his father was a steady,\nhard-working shift-boss of the mine. Every other Sunday he became an\nirresponsible animal, a beast, a brute, crazy with alcohol.\n\nMcTeague remembered his mother, too, who, with the help of the Chinaman,\ncooked for forty miners. She was an overworked drudge, fiery and\nenergetic for all that, filled with the one idea of having her son rise\nin life and enter a profession. The chance had come at last when the\nfather died, corroded with alcohol, collapsing in a few hours. Two or\nthree years later a travelling dentist visited the mine and put up his\ntent near the bunk-house. He was more or less of a charlatan, but he\nfired Mrs. McTeague's ambition, and young McTeague went away with him\nto learn his profession. He had learnt it after a fashion, mostly by\nwatching the charlatan operate. He had read many of the necessary books,\nbut he was too hopelessly stupid to get much benefit from them.\n\nThen one day at San Francisco had come the news of his mother's death;\nshe had left him some money--not much, but enough to set him up in\nbusiness; so he had cut loose from the charlatan and had opened his\n\"Dental Parlors\" on Polk Street, an \"accommodation street\" of small\nshops in the residence quarter of the town. Here he had slowly\ncollected a clientele of butcher boys, shop girls, drug clerks, and car\nconductors. He made but few acquaintances. Polk Street called him the\n\"Doctor\" and spoke of his enormous strength. For McTeague was a young\ngiant, carrying his huge shock of blond hair six feet three inches\nfrom the ground; moving his immense limbs, heavy with ropes of muscle,\nslowly, ponderously. His hands were enormous, red, and covered with a\nfell of stiff yellow hair; they were hard as wooden mallets, strong\nas vises, the hands of the old-time car-boy. Often he dispensed with\nforceps and extracted a refractory tooth with his thumb and finger.\nHis head was square-cut, angular; the jaw salient, like that of the\ncarnivora.\n\nMcTeague's mind was as his body, heavy, slow to act, sluggish. Yet there\nwas nothing vicious about the man. Altogether he suggested the draught\nhorse, immensely strong, stupid, docile, obedient.\n\nWhen he opened his \"Dental Parlors,\" he felt that his life was a\nsuccess, that he could hope for nothing better. In spite of the name,\nthere was but one room. It was a corner room on the second floor over\nthe branch post-office, and faced the street. McTeague made it do for\na bedroom as well, sleeping on the big bed-lounge against the wall\nopposite the window. There was a washstand behind the screen in the\ncorner where he manufactured his moulds. In the round bay window were\nhis operating chair, his dental engine, and the movable rack on which\nhe laid out his instruments. Three chairs, a bargain at the second-hand\nstore, ranged themselves against the wall with military precision\nunderneath a steel engraving of the court of Lorenzo de' Medici, which\nhe had bought because there were a great many figures in it for the\nmoney. Over the bed-lounge hung a rifle manufacturer's advertisement\ncalendar which he never used. The other ornaments were a small\nmarble-topped centre table covered with back numbers of \"The American\nSystem of Dentistry,\" a stone pug dog sitting before the little stove,\nand a thermometer. A stand of shelves occupied one corner, filled with\nthe seven volumes of \"Allen's Practical Dentist.\" On the top shelf\nMcTeague kept his concertina and a bag of bird seed for the canary. The\nwhole place exhaled a mingled odor of bedding, creosote, and ether.\n\nBut for one thing, McTeague would have been perfectly contented. Just\noutside his window was his signboard--a modest affair--that read:\n\"Doctor McTeague. Dental Parlors. Gas Given\"; but that was all. It was\nhis ambition, his dream, to have projecting from that corner window a\nhuge gilded tooth, a molar with enormous prongs, something gorgeous and\nattractive. He would have it some day, on that he was resolved; but as\nyet such a thing was far beyond his means.\n\nWhen he had finished the last of his beer, McTeague slowly wiped his\nlips and huge yellow mustache with the side of his hand. Bull-like, he\nheaved himself laboriously up, and, going to the window, stood looking\ndown into the street.\n\nThe street never failed to interest him. It was one of those cross\nstreets peculiar to Western cities, situated in the heart of the\nresidence quarter, but occupied by small tradespeople who lived in the\nrooms above their shops. There were corner drug stores with huge jars\nof red, yellow, and green liquids in their windows, very brave and gay;\nstationers' stores, where illustrated weeklies were tacked upon bulletin\nboards; barber shops with cigar stands in their vestibules; sad-looking\nplumbers' offices; cheap restaurants, in whose windows one saw piles of\nunopened oysters weighted down by cubes of ice, and china pigs and cows\nknee deep in layers of white beans. At one end of the street McTeague\ncould see the huge power-house of the cable line. Immediately opposite\nhim was a great market; while farther on, over the chimney stacks of the\nintervening houses, the glass roof of some huge public baths glittered\nlike crystal in the afternoon sun. Underneath him the branch post-office\nwas opening its doors, as was its custom between two and three\no'clock on Sunday afternoons. An acrid odor of ink rose upward to him.\nOccasionally a cable car passed, trundling heavily, with a strident\nwhirring of jostled glass windows.\n\nOn week days the street was very lively. It woke to its work about seven\no'clock, at the time when the newsboys made their appearance together\nwith the day laborers. The laborers went trudging past in a straggling\nfile--plumbers' apprentices, their pockets stuffed with sections of\nlead pipe, tweezers, and pliers; carpenters, carrying nothing but their\nlittle pasteboard lunch baskets painted to imitate leather; gangs of\nstreet workers, their overalls soiled with yellow clay, their picks and\nlong-handled shovels over their shoulders; plasterers, spotted with lime\nfrom head to foot. This little army of workers, tramping steadily in\none direction, met and mingled with other toilers of a different\ndescription--conductors and \"swing men\" of the cable company going on\nduty; heavy-eyed night clerks from the drug stores on their way home to\nsleep; roundsmen returning to the precinct police station to make their\nnight report, and Chinese market gardeners teetering past under their\nheavy baskets. The cable cars began to fill up; all along the street\ncould be seen the shopkeepers taking down their shutters.\n\nBetween seven and eight the street breakfasted. Now and then a waiter\nfrom one of the cheap restaurants crossed from one sidewalk to the\nother, balancing on one palm a tray covered with a napkin. Everywhere\nwas the smell of coffee and of frying steaks. A little later, following\nin the path of the day laborers, came the clerks and shop girls,\ndressed with a certain cheap smartness, always in a hurry, glancing\napprehensively at the power-house clock. Their employers followed\nan hour or so later--on the cable cars for the most part whiskered\ngentlemen with huge stomachs, reading the morning papers with great\ngravity; bank cashiers and insurance clerks with flowers in their\nbuttonholes.\n\nAt the same time the school children invaded the street, filling the air\nwith a clamor of shrill voices, stopping at the stationers' shops, or\nidling a moment in the doorways of the candy stores. For over half an\nhour they held possession of the sidewalks, then suddenly disappeared,\nleaving behind one or two stragglers who hurried along with great\nstrides of their little thin legs, very anxious and preoccupied.\n\nTowards eleven o'clock the ladies from the great avenue a block above\nPolk Street made their appearance, promenading the sidewalks leisurely,\ndeliberately. They were at their morning's marketing. They were handsome\nwomen, beautifully dressed. They knew by name their butchers and grocers\nand vegetable men. From his window McTeague saw them in front of the\nstalls, gloved and veiled and daintily shod, the subservient provision\nmen at their elbows, scribbling hastily in the order books. They all\nseemed to know one another, these grand ladies from the fashionable\navenue. Meetings took place here and there; a conversation was begun;\nothers arrived; groups were formed; little impromptu receptions were\nheld before the chopping blocks of butchers' stalls, or on the sidewalk,\naround boxes of berries and fruit.\n\nFrom noon to evening the population of the street was of a mixed\ncharacter. The street was busiest at that time; a vast and prolonged\nmurmur arose--the mingled shuffling of feet, the rattle of wheels, the\nheavy trundling of cable cars. At four o'clock the school children\nonce more swarmed the sidewalks, again disappearing with surprising\nsuddenness. At six the great homeward march commenced; the cars were\ncrowded, the laborers thronged the sidewalks, the newsboys chanted the\nevening papers. Then all at once the street fell quiet; hardly a soul\nwas in sight; the sidewalks were deserted. It was supper hour. Evening\nbegan; and one by one a multitude of lights, from the demoniac glare of\nthe druggists' windows to the dazzling blue whiteness of the electric\nglobes, grew thick from street corner to street corner. Once more the\nstreet was crowded. Now there was no thought but for amusement. The\ncable cars were loaded with theatre-goers--men in high hats and\nyoung girls in furred opera cloaks. On the sidewalks were groups and\ncouples--the plumbers' apprentices, the girls of the ribbon counters,\nthe little families that lived on the second stories over their shops,\nthe dressmakers, the small doctors, the harness-makers--all the various\ninhabitants of the street were abroad, strolling idly from shop window\nto shop window, taking the air after the day's work. Groups of girls\ncollected on the corners, talking and laughing very loud, making remarks\nupon the young men that passed them. The tamale men appeared. A band of\nSalvationists began to sing before a saloon.\n\nThen, little by little, Polk Street dropped back to solitude. Eleven\no'clock struck from the power-house clock. Lights were extinguished. At\none o'clock the cable stopped, leaving an abrupt silence in the air.\nAll at once it seemed very still. The ugly noises were the occasional\nfootfalls of a policeman and the persistent calling of ducks and geese\nin the closed market. The street was asleep.\n\nDay after day, McTeague saw the same panorama unroll itself. The bay\nwindow of his \"Dental Parlors\" was for him a point of vantage from which\nhe watched the world go past.\n\nOn Sundays, however, all was changed. As he stood in the bay window,\nafter finishing his beer, wiping his lips, and looking out into the\nstreet, McTeague was conscious of the difference. Nearly all the stores\nwere closed. No wagons passed. A few people hurried up and down the\nsidewalks, dressed in cheap Sunday finery. A cable car went by; on the\noutside seats were a party of returning picnickers. The mother, the\nfather, a young man, and a young girl, and three children. The two older\npeople held empty lunch baskets in their laps, while the bands of the\nchildren's hats were stuck full of oak leaves. The girl carried a huge\nbunch of wilting poppies and wild flowers.\n\nAs the car approached McTeague's window the young man got up and swung\nhimself off the platform, waving goodby to the party. Suddenly McTeague\nrecognized him.\n\n\"There's Marcus Schouler,\" he muttered behind his mustache.\n\nMarcus Schouler was the dentist's one intimate friend. The acquaintance\nhad begun at the car conductors' coffee-joint, where the two occupied\nthe same table and met at every meal. Then they made the discovery that\nthey both lived in the same flat, Marcus occupying a room on the floor\nabove McTeague. On different occasions McTeague had treated Marcus for\nan ulcerated tooth and had refused to accept payment. Soon it came to be\nan understood thing between them. They were \"pals.\"\n\nMcTeague, listening, heard Marcus go up-stairs to his room above. In a\nfew minutes his door opened again. McTeague knew that he had come out\ninto the hall and was leaning over the banisters.\n\n\"Oh, Mac!\" he called. McTeague came to his door.\n\n\"Hullo! 'sthat you, Mark?\"\n\n\"Sure,\" answered Marcus. \"Come on up.\"\n\n\"You come on down.\"\n\n\"No, come on up.\"\n\n\"Oh, you come on down.\"\n\n\"Oh, you lazy duck!\" retorted Marcus, coming down the stairs.\n\n\"Been out to the Cliff House on a picnic,\" he explained as he sat down\non the bed-lounge, \"with my uncle and his people--the Sieppes, you know.\nBy damn! it was hot,\" he suddenly vociferated. \"Just look at that! Just\nlook at that!\" he cried, dragging at his limp collar. \"That's the third\none since morning; it is--it is, for a fact--and you got your stove\ngoing.\" He began to tell about the picnic, talking very loud and fast,\ngesturing furiously, very excited over trivial details. Marcus could not\ntalk without getting excited.\n\n\"You ought t'have seen, y'ought t'have seen. I tell you, it was outa\nsight. It was; it was, for a fact.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" answered McTeague, bewildered, trying to follow. \"Yes,\nthat's so.\"\n\nIn recounting a certain dispute with an awkward bicyclist, in which it\nappeared he had become involved, Marcus quivered with rage. \"'Say that\nagain,' says I to um. 'Just say that once more, and'\"--here a rolling\nexplosion of oaths--\"'you'll go back to the city in the Morgue wagon.\nAin't I got a right to cross a street even, I'd like to know, without\nbeing run down--what?' I say it's outrageous. I'd a knifed him in\nanother minute. It was an outrage. I say it was an OUTRAGE.\"\n\n\"Sure it was,\" McTeague hastened to reply. \"Sure, sure.\"\n\n\"Oh, and we had an accident,\" shouted the other, suddenly off on another\ntack. \"It was awful. Trina was in the swing there--that's my cousin\nTrina, you know who I mean--and she fell out. By damn! I thought she'd\nkilled herself; struck her face on a rock and knocked out a front tooth.\nIt's a wonder she didn't kill herself. It IS a wonder; it is, for a\nfact. Ain't it, now? Huh? Ain't it? Y'ought t'have seen.\"\n\nMcTeague had a vague idea that Marcus Schouler was stuck on his cousin\nTrina. They \"kept company\" a good deal; Marcus took dinner with the\nSieppes every Saturday evening at their home at B Street station, across\nthe bay, and Sunday afternoons he and the family usually made little\nexcursions into the suburbs. McTeague began to wonder dimly how it\nwas that on this occasion Marcus had not gone home with his cousin. As\nsometimes happens, Marcus furnished the explanation upon the instant.\n\n\"I promised a duck up here on the avenue I'd call for his dog at four\nthis afternoon.\"\n\nMarcus was Old Grannis's assistant in a little dog hospital that the\nlatter had opened in a sort of alley just off Polk Street, some four\nblocks above Old Grannis lived in one of the back rooms of McTeague's\nflat. He was an Englishman and an expert dog surgeon, but Marcus\nSchouler was a bungler in the profession. His father had been a\nveterinary surgeon who had kept a livery stable near by, on California\nStreet, and Marcus's knowledge of the diseases of domestic animals had\nbeen picked up in a haphazard way, much after the manner of McTeague's\neducation. Somehow he managed to impress Old Grannis, a gentle,\nsimple-minded old man, with a sense of his fitness, bewildering him with\na torrent of empty phrases that he delivered with fierce gestures and\nwith a manner of the greatest conviction.\n\n\"You'd better come along with me, Mac,\" observed Marcus. \"We'll get the\nduck's dog, and then we'll take a little walk, huh? You got nothun to\ndo. Come along.\"\n\nMcTeague went out with him, and the two friends proceeded up to the\navenue to the house where the dog was to be found. It was a huge\nmansion-like place, set in an enormous garden that occupied a whole\nthird of the block; and while Marcus tramped up the front steps and rang\nthe doorbell boldly, to show his independence, McTeague remained below\non the sidewalk, gazing stupidly at the curtained windows, the marble\nsteps, and the bronze griffins, troubled and a little confused by all\nthis massive luxury.\n\nAfter they had taken the dog to the hospital and had left him to whimper\nbehind the wire netting, they returned to Polk Street and had a glass of\nbeer in the back room of Joe Frenna's corner grocery.\n\nEver since they had left the huge mansion on the avenue, Marcus had been\nattacking the capitalists, a class which he pretended to execrate. It\nwas a pose which he often assumed, certain of impressing the dentist.\nMarcus had picked up a few half-truths of political economy--it was\nimpossible to say where--and as soon as the two had settled themselves\nto their beer in Frenna's back room he took up the theme of the labor\nquestion. He discussed it at the top of his voice, vociferating, shaking\nhis fists, exciting himself with his own noise. He was continually\nmaking use of the stock phrases of the professional politician--phrases\nhe had caught at some of the ward \"rallies\" and \"ratification meetings.\"\nThese rolled off his tongue with incredible emphasis, appearing at every\nturn of his conversation--\"Outraged constituencies,\" \"cause of labor,\"\n\"wage earners,\" \"opinions biased by personal interests,\" \"eyes blinded\nby party prejudice.\" McTeague listened to him, awestruck.\n\n\"There's where the evil lies,\" Marcus would cry. \"The masses must learn\nself-control; it stands to reason. Look at the figures, look at the\nfigures. Decrease the number of wage earners and you increase wages,\ndon't you? don't you?\"\n\nAbsolutely stupid, and understanding never a word, McTeague would\nanswer:\n\n\"Yes, yes, that's it--self-control--that's the word.\"\n\n\"It's the capitalists that's ruining the cause of labor,\" shouted\nMarcus, banging the table with his fist till the beer glasses danced;\n\"white-livered drones, traitors, with their livers white as snow, eatun\nthe bread of widows and orphuns; there's where the evil lies.\"\n\nStupefied with his clamor, McTeague answered, wagging his head:\n\n\"Yes, that's it; I think it's their livers.\"\n\nSuddenly Marcus fell calm again, forgetting his pose all in an instant.\n\n\"Say, Mac, I told my cousin Trina to come round and see you about that\ntooth of her's. She'll be in to-morrow, I guess.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\n\nAfter his breakfast the following Monday morning, McTeague looked over\nthe appointments he had written down in the book-slate that hung against\nthe screen. His writing was immense, very clumsy, and very round, with\nhuge, full-bellied l's and h's. He saw that he had made an appointment\nat one o'clock for Miss Baker, the retired dressmaker, a little old maid\nwho had a tiny room a few doors down the hall. It adjoined that of Old\nGrannis.\n\nQuite an affair had arisen from this circumstance. Miss Baker and Old\nGrannis were both over sixty, and yet it was current talk amongst\nthe lodgers of the flat that the two were in love with each other.\nSingularly enough, they were not even acquaintances; never a word had\npassed between them. At intervals they met on the stairway; he on his\nway to his little dog hospital, she returning from a bit of marketing\nin the street. At such times they passed each other with averted\neyes, pretending a certain preoccupation, suddenly seized with a great\nembarrassment, the timidity of a second childhood. He went on about his\nbusiness, disturbed and thoughtful. She hurried up to her tiny room,\nher curious little false curls shaking with her agitation, the faintest\nsuggestion of a flush coming and going in her withered cheeks. The\nemotion of one of these chance meetings remained with them during all\nthe rest of the day.\n\nWas it the first romance in the lives of each? Did Old Grannis ever\nremember a certain face amongst those that he had known when he was\nyoung Grannis--the face of some pale-haired girl, such as one sees in\nthe old cathedral towns of England? Did Miss Baker still treasure up\nin a seldom opened drawer or box some faded daguerreotype, some strange\nold-fashioned likeness, with its curling hair and high stock? It was\nimpossible to say.\n\nMaria Macapa, the Mexican woman who took care of the lodgers' rooms, had\nbeen the first to call the flat's attention to the affair, spreading the\nnews of it from room to room, from floor to floor. Of late she had made\na great discovery; all the women folk of the flat were yet vibrant with\nit. Old Grannis came home from his work at four o'clock, and between\nthat time and six Miss Baker would sit in her room, her hands idle in\nher lap, doing nothing, listening, waiting. Old Grannis did the same,\ndrawing his arm-chair near to the wall, knowing that Miss Baker was upon\nthe other side, conscious, perhaps, that she was thinking of him; and\nthere the two would sit through the hours of the afternoon, listening\nand waiting, they did not know exactly for what, but near to each other,\nseparated only by the thin partition of their rooms. They had come\nto know each other's habits. Old Grannis knew that at quarter of five\nprecisely Miss Baker made a cup of tea over the oil stove on the stand\nbetween the bureau and the window. Miss Baker felt instinctively the\nexact moment when Old Grannis took down his little binding apparatus\nfrom the second shelf of his clothes closet and began his favorite\noccupation of binding pamphlets--pamphlets that he never read, for all\nthat.\n\nIn his \"Parlors\" McTeague began his week's work. He glanced in the glass\nsaucer in which he kept his sponge-gold, and noticing that he had\nused up all his pellets, set about making some more. In examining Miss\nBaker's teeth at the preliminary sitting he had found a cavity in one\nof the incisors. Miss Baker had decided to have it filled with gold.\nMcTeague remembered now that it was what is called a \"proximate case,\"\nwhere there is not sufficient room to fill with large pieces of gold. He\ntold himself that he should have to use \"mats\" in the filling. He made\nsome dozen of these \"mats\" from his tape of non-cohesive gold, cutting\nit transversely into small pieces that could be inserted edgewise\nbetween the teeth and consolidated by packing. After he had made his\n\"mats\" he continued with the other kind of gold fillings, such as he\nwould have occasion to use during the week; \"blocks\" to be used in large\nproximal cavities, made by folding the tape on itself a number of\ntimes and then shaping it with the soldering pliers; \"cylinders\" for\ncommencing fillings, which he formed by rolling the tape around a needle\ncalled a \"broach,\" cutting it afterwards into different lengths. He\nworked slowly, mechanically, turning the foil between his fingers with\nthe manual dexterity that one sometimes sees in stupid persons. His head\nwas quite empty of all thought, and he did not whistle over his work\nas another man might have done. The canary made up for his silence,\ntrilling and chittering continually, splashing about in its morning\nbath, keeping up an incessant noise and movement that would have been\nmaddening to any one but McTeague, who seemed to have no nerves at all.\n\nAfter he had finished his fillings, he made a hook broach from a bit of\npiano wire to replace an old one that he had lost. It was time for his\ndinner then, and when he returned from the car conductors' coffee-joint,\nhe found Miss Baker waiting for him.\n\nThe ancient little dressmaker was at all times willing to talk of Old\nGrannis to anybody that would listen, quite unconscious of the gossip\nof the flat. McTeague found her all a-flutter with excitement. Something\nextraordinary had happened. She had found out that the wall-paper in Old\nGrannis's room was the same as that in hers.\n\n\"It has led me to thinking, Doctor McTeague,\" she exclaimed, shaking her\nlittle false curls at him. \"You know my room is so small, anyhow, and\nthe wall-paper being the same--the pattern from my room continues right\ninto his--I declare, I believe at one time that was all one room. Think\nof it, do you suppose it was? It almost amounts to our occupying the\nsame room. I don't know--why, really--do you think I should speak to the\nlandlady about it? He bound pamphlets last night until half-past nine.\nThey say that he's the younger son of a baronet; that there are reasons\nfor his not coming to the title; his stepfather wronged him cruelly.\"\n\nNo one had ever said such a thing. It was preposterous to imagine any\nmystery connected with Old Grannis. Miss Baker had chosen to invent the\nlittle fiction, had created the title and the unjust stepfather from\nsome dim memories of the novels of her girlhood.\n\nShe took her place in the operating chair. McTeague began the filling.\nThere was a long silence. It was impossible for McTeague to work and\ntalk at the same time.\n\nHe was just burnishing the last \"mat\" in Miss Baker's tooth, when the\ndoor of the \"Parlors\" opened, jangling the bell which he had hung over\nit, and which was absolutely unnecessary. McTeague turned, one foot on\nthe pedal of his dental engine, the corundum disk whirling between his\nfingers.\n\nIt was Marcus Schouler who came in, ushering a young girl of about\ntwenty.\n\n\"Hello, Mac,\" exclaimed Marcus; \"busy? Brought my cousin round about\nthat broken tooth.\"\n\nMcTeague nodded his head gravely.\n\n\"In a minute,\" he answered.\n\nMarcus and his cousin Trina sat down in the rigid chairs underneath the\nsteel engraving of the Court of Lorenzo de' Medici. They began talking\nin low tones. The girl looked about the room, noticing the stone pug\ndog, the rifle manufacturer's calendar, the canary in its little gilt\nprison, and the tumbled blankets on the unmade bed-lounge against\nthe wall. Marcus began telling her about McTeague. \"We're pals,\" he\nexplained, just above a whisper. \"Ah, Mac's all right, you bet. Say,\nTrina, he's the strongest duck you ever saw. What do you suppose? He can\npull out your teeth with his fingers; yes, he can. What do you think of\nthat? With his fingers, mind you; he can, for a fact. Get on to the size\nof him, anyhow. Ah, Mac's all right!\"\n\nMaria Macapa had come into the room while he had been speaking. She was\nmaking up McTeague's bed. Suddenly Marcus exclaimed under his breath:\n\"Now we'll have some fun. It's the girl that takes care of the rooms.\nShe's a greaser, and she's queer in the head. She ain't regularly crazy,\nbut I don't know, she's queer. Y'ought to hear her go on about a gold\ndinner service she says her folks used to own. Ask her what her name is\nand see what she'll say.\" Trina shrank back, a little frightened.\n\n\"No, you ask,\" she whispered.\n\n\"Ah, go on; what you 'fraid of?\" urged Marcus. Trina shook her head\nenergetically, shutting her lips together.\n\n\"Well, listen here,\" answered Marcus, nudging her; then raising his\nvoice, he said:\n\n\"How do, Maria?\" Maria nodded to him over her shoulder as she bent over\nthe lounge.\n\n\"Workun hard nowadays, Maria?\"\n\n\"Pretty hard.\"\n\n\"Didunt always have to work for your living, though, did you, when you\nate offa gold dishes?\" Maria didn't answer, except by putting her chin\nin the air and shutting her eyes, as though to say she knew a long story\nabout that if she had a mind to talk. All Marcus's efforts to draw her\nout on the subject were unavailing. She only responded by movements of\nher head.\n\n\"Can't always start her going,\" Marcus told his cousin.\n\n\"What does she do, though, when you ask her about her name?\"\n\n\"Oh, sure,\" said Marcus, who had forgotten. \"Say, Maria, what's your\nname?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" asked Maria, straightening up, her hands on he hips.\n\n\"Tell us your name,\" repeated Marcus.\n\n\"Name is Maria--Miranda--Macapa.\" Then, after a pause, she added, as\nthough she had but that moment thought of it, \"Had a flying squirrel an'\nlet him go.\"\n\nInvariably Maria Macapa made this answer. It was not always she would\ntalk about the famous service of gold plate, but a question as to her\nname never failed to elicit the same strange answer, delivered in a\nrapid undertone: \"Name is Maria--Miranda--Macapa.\" Then, as if struck\nwith an after thought, \"Had a flying squirrel an' let him go.\"\n\nWhy Maria should associate the release of the mythical squirrel with\nher name could not be said. About Maria the flat knew absolutely nothing\nfurther than that she was Spanish-American. Miss Baker was the oldest\nlodger in the flat, and Maria was a fixture there as maid of all work\nwhen she had come. There was a legend to the effect that Maria's people\nhad been at one time immensely wealthy in Central America.\n\nMaria turned again to her work. Trina and Marcus watched her curiously.\nThere was a silence. The corundum burr in McTeague's engine hummed in a\nprolonged monotone. The canary bird chittered occasionally. The room was\nwarm, and the breathing of the five people in the narrow space made the\nair close and thick. At long intervals an acrid odor of ink floated up\nfrom the branch post-office immediately below.\n\nMaria Macapa finished her work and started to leave. As she passed near\nMarcus and his cousin she stopped, and drew a bunch of blue tickets\nfurtively from her pocket. \"Buy a ticket in the lottery?\" she inquired,\nlooking at the girl. \"Just a dollar.\"\n\n\"Go along with you, Maria,\" said Marcus, who had but thirty cents in his\npocket. \"Go along; it's against the law.\"\n\n\"Buy a ticket,\" urged Maria, thrusting the bundle toward Trina. \"Try\nyour luck. The butcher on the next block won twenty dollars the last\ndrawing.\"\n\nVery uneasy, Trina bought a ticket for the sake of being rid of her.\nMaria disappeared.\n\n\"Ain't she a queer bird?\" muttered Marcus. He was much embarrassed and\ndisturbed because he had not bought the ticket for Trina.\n\nBut there was a sudden movement. McTeague had just finished with Miss\nBaker.\n\n\"You should notice,\" the dressmaker said to the dentist, in a low voice,\n\"he always leaves the door a little ajar in the afternoon.\" When she had\ngone out, Marcus Schouler brought Trina forward.\n\n\"Say, Mac, this is my cousin, Trina Sieppe.\" The two shook hands dumbly,\nMcTeague slowly nodding his huge head with its great shock of yellow\nhair. Trina was very small and prettily made. Her face was round and\nrather pale; her eyes long and narrow and blue, like the half-open eyes\nof a little baby; her lips and the lobes of her tiny ears were pale, a\nlittle suggestive of anaemia; while across the bridge of her nose ran\nan adorable little line of freckles. But it was to her hair that one's\nattention was most attracted. Heaps and heaps of blue-black coils and\nbraids, a royal crown of swarthy bands, a veritable sable tiara, heavy,\nabundant, odorous. All the vitality that should have given color to her\nface seemed to have been absorbed by this marvellous hair. It was\nthe coiffure of a queen that shadowed the pale temples of this little\nbourgeoise. So heavy was it that it tipped her head backward, and\nthe position thrust her chin out a little. It was a charming poise,\ninnocent, confiding, almost infantile.\n\nShe was dressed all in black, very modest and plain. The effect of her\npale face in all this contrasting black was almost monastic.\n\n\"Well,\" exclaimed Marcus suddenly, \"I got to go. Must get back to work.\nDon't hurt her too much, Mac. S'long, Trina.\"\n\nMcTeague and Trina were left alone. He was embarrassed, troubled.\nThese young girls disturbed and perplexed him. He did not like\nthem, obstinately cherishing that intuitive suspicion of all things\nfeminine--the perverse dislike of an overgrown boy. On the other hand,\nshe was perfectly at her ease; doubtless the woman in her was not yet\nawakened; she was yet, as one might say, without sex. She was almost\nlike a boy, frank, candid, unreserved.\n\nShe took her place in the operating chair and told him what was the\nmatter, looking squarely into his face. She had fallen out of a swing\nthe afternoon of the preceding day; one of her teeth had been knocked\nloose and the other altogether broken out.\n\nMcTeague listened to her with apparent stolidity, nodding his head from\ntime to time as she spoke. The keenness of his dislike of her as a woman\nbegan to be blunted. He thought she was rather pretty, that he even\nliked her because she was so small, so prettily made, so good natured\nand straightforward.\n\n\"Let's have a look at your teeth,\" he said, picking up his mirror. \"You\nbetter take your hat off.\" She leaned back in her chair and opened her\nmouth, showing the rows of little round teeth, as white and even as the\nkernels on an ear of green corn, except where an ugly gap came at the\nside.\n\nMcTeague put the mirror into her mouth, touching one and another of her\nteeth with the handle of an excavator. By and by he straightened up,\nwiping the moisture from the mirror on his coat-sleeve.\n\n\"Well, Doctor,\" said the girl, anxiously, \"it's a dreadful\ndisfigurement, isn't it?\" adding, \"What can you do about it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" answered McTeague, slowly, looking vaguely about on the floor of\nthe room, \"the roots of the broken tooth are still in the gum; they'll\nhave to come out, and I guess I'll have to pull that other bicuspid. Let\nme look again. Yes,\" he went on in a moment, peering into her mouth\nwith the mirror, \"I guess that'll have to come out, too.\" The tooth was\nloose, discolored, and evidently dead. \"It's a curious case,\" McTeague\nwent on. \"I don't know as I ever had a tooth like that before. It's\nwhat's called necrosis. It don't often happen. It'll have to come out\nsure.\"\n\nThen a discussion was opened on the subject, Trina sitting up in the\nchair, holding her hat in her lap; McTeague leaning against the window\nframe his hands in his pockets, his eyes wandering about on the floor.\nTrina did not want the other tooth removed; one hole like that was bad\nenough; but two--ah, no, it was not to be thought of.\n\nBut McTeague reasoned with her, tried in vain to make her understand\nthat there was no vascular connection between the root and the gum.\nTrina was blindly persistent, with the persistency of a girl who has\nmade up her mind.\n\nMcTeague began to like her better and better, and after a while\ncommenced himself to feel that it would be a pity to disfigure such\na pretty mouth. He became interested; perhaps he could do something,\nsomething in the way of a crown or bridge. \"Let's look at that again,\"\nhe said, picking up his mirror. He began to study the situation very\ncarefully, really desiring to remedy the blemish.\n\nIt was the first bicuspid that was missing, and though part of the root\nof the second (the loose one) would remain after its extraction, he was\nsure it would not be strong enough to sustain a crown. All at once\nhe grew obstinate, resolving, with all the strength of a crude and\nprimitive man, to conquer the difficulty in spite of everything. He\nturned over in his mind the technicalities of the case. No, evidently\nthe root was not strong enough to sustain a crown; besides that, it was\nplaced a little irregularly in the arch. But, fortunately, there were\ncavities in the two teeth on either side of the gap--one in the first\nmolar and one in the palatine surface of the cuspid; might he not drill\na socket in the remaining root and sockets in the molar and cuspid, and,\npartly by bridging, partly by crowning, fill in the gap? He made up his\nmind to do it.\n\nWhy he should pledge himself to this hazardous case McTeague was puzzled\nto know. With most of his clients he would have contented himself with\nthe extraction of the loose tooth and the roots of the broken one. Why\nshould he risk his reputation in this case? He could not say why.\n\nIt was the most difficult operation he had ever performed. He bungled\nit considerably, but in the end he succeeded passably well. He extracted\nthe loose tooth with his bayonet forceps and prepared the roots of the\nbroken one as if for filling, fitting into them a flattened piece of\nplatinum wire to serve as a dowel. But this was only the beginning;\naltogether it was a fortnight's work. Trina came nearly every other day,\nand passed two, and even three, hours in the chair.\n\nBy degrees McTeague's first awkwardness and suspicion vanished entirely.\nThe two became good friends. McTeague even arrived at that point where\nhe could work and talk to her at the same time--a thing that had never\nbefore been possible for him.\n\nNever until then had McTeague become so well acquainted with a girl of\nTrina's age. The younger women of Polk Street--the shop girls, the\nyoung women of the soda fountains, the waitresses in the cheap\nrestaurants--preferred another dentist, a young fellow just graduated\nfrom the college, a poser, a rider of bicycles, a man about town, who\nwore astonishing waistcoats and bet money on greyhound coursing. Trina\nwas McTeague's first experience. With her the feminine element suddenly\nentered his little world. It was not only her that he saw and felt,\nit was the woman, the whole sex, an entire new humanity, strange and\nalluring, that he seemed to have discovered. How had he ignored it so\nlong? It was dazzling, delicious, charming beyond all words. His narrow\npoint of view was at once enlarged and confused, and all at once he\nsaw that there was something else in life besides concertinas and steam\nbeer. Everything had to be made over again. His whole rude idea of\nlife had to be changed. The male virile desire in him tardily awakened,\naroused itself, strong and brutal. It was resistless, untrained, a thing\nnot to be held in leash an instant.\n\nLittle by little, by gradual, almost imperceptible degrees, the thought\nof Trina Sieppe occupied his mind from day to day, from hour to hour.\nHe found himself thinking of her constantly; at every instant he saw\nher round, pale face; her narrow, milk-blue eyes; her little out-thrust\nchin; her heavy, huge tiara of black hair. At night he lay awake for\nhours under the thick blankets of the bed-lounge, staring upward\ninto the darkness, tormented with the idea of her, exasperated at the\ndelicate, subtle mesh in which he found himself entangled. During the\nforenoons, while he went about his work, he thought of her. As he made\nhis plaster-of-paris moulds at the washstand in the corner behind the\nscreen he turned over in his mind all that had happened, all that\nhad been said at the previous sitting. Her little tooth that he had\nextracted he kept wrapped in a bit of newspaper in his vest pocket.\nOften he took it out and held it in the palm of his immense, horny hand,\nseized with some strange elephantine sentiment, wagging his head at it,\nheaving tremendous sighs. What a folly!\n\nAt two o'clock on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays Trina arrived and\ntook her place in the operating chair. While at his work McTeague was\nevery minute obliged to bend closely over her; his hands touched her\nface, her cheeks, her adorable little chin; her lips pressed against his\nfingers. She breathed warmly on his forehead and on his eyelids,\nwhile the odor of her hair, a charming feminine perfume, sweet, heavy,\nenervating, came to his nostrils, so penetrating, so delicious, that his\nflesh pricked and tingled with it; a veritable sensation of faintness\npassed over this huge, callous fellow, with his enormous bones and\ncorded muscles. He drew a short breath through his nose; his jaws\nsuddenly gripped together vise-like.\n\nBut this was only at times--a strange, vexing spasm, that subsided\nalmost immediately. For the most part, McTeague enjoyed the pleasure of\nthese sittings with Trina with a certain strong calmness, blindly happy\nthat she was there. This poor crude dentist of Polk Street, stupid,\nignorant, vulgar, with his sham education and plebeian tastes, whose\nonly relaxations were to eat, to drink steam beer, and to play upon his\nconcertina, was living through his first romance, his first idyl. It\nwas delightful. The long hours he passed alone with Trina in the \"Dental\nParlors,\" silent, only for the scraping of the instruments and the\npouring of bud-burrs in the engine, in the foul atmosphere, overheated\nby the little stove and heavy with the smell of ether, creosote, and\nstale bedding, had all the charm of secret appointments and stolen\nmeetings under the moon.\n\nBy degrees the operation progressed. One day, just after McTeague had\nput in the temporary gutta-percha fillings and nothing more could be\ndone at that sitting, Trina asked him to examine the rest of her teeth.\nThey were perfect, with one exception--a spot of white caries on the\nlateral surface of an incisor. McTeague filled it with gold, enlarging\nthe cavity with hard-bits and hoe-excavators, and burring in afterward\nwith half-cone burrs. The cavity was deep, and Trina began to wince and\nmoan. To hurt Trina was a positive anguish for McTeague, yet an anguish\nwhich he was obliged to endure at every hour of the sitting. It was\nharrowing--he sweated under it--to be forced to torture her, of all\nwomen in the world; could anything be worse than that?\n\n\"Hurt?\" he inquired, anxiously.\n\nShe answered by frowning, with a sharp intake of breath, putting her\nfingers over her closed lips and nodding her head. McTeague sprayed the\ntooth with glycerite of tannin, but without effect. Rather than hurt her\nhe found himself forced to the use of anaesthesia, which he hated.\nHe had a notion that the nitrous oxide gas was dangerous, so on this\noccasion, as on all others, used ether.\n\nHe put the sponge a half dozen times to Trina's face, more nervous than\nhe had ever been before, watching the symptoms closely. Her breathing\nbecame short and irregular; there was a slight twitching of the muscles.\nWhen her thumbs turned inward toward the palms, he took the sponge away.\nShe passed off very quickly, and, with a long sigh, sank back into the\nchair.\n\nMcTeague straightened up, putting the sponge upon the rack behind him,\nhis eyes fixed upon Trina's face. For some time he stood watching her as\nshe lay there, unconscious and helpless, and very pretty. He was alone\nwith her, and she was absolutely without defense.\n\nSuddenly the animal in the man stirred and woke; the evil instincts\nthat in him were so close to the surface leaped to life, shouting and\nclamoring.\n\nIt was a crisis--a crisis that had arisen all in an instant; a crisis\nfor which he was totally unprepared. Blindly, and without knowing\nwhy, McTeague fought against it, moved by an unreasoned instinct of\nresistance. Within him, a certain second self, another better McTeague\nrose with the brute; both were strong, with the huge crude strength\nof the man himself. The two were at grapples. There in that cheap and\nshabby \"Dental Parlor\" a dreaded struggle began. It was the old battle,\nold as the world, wide as the world--the sudden panther leap of\nthe animal, lips drawn, fangs aflash, hideous, monstrous, not to be\nresisted, and the simultaneous arousing of the other man, the better\nself that cries, \"Down, down,\" without knowing why; that grips the\nmonster; that fights to strangle it, to thrust it down and back.\n\nDizzied and bewildered with the shock, the like of which he had never\nknown before, McTeague turned from Trina, gazing bewilderedly about the\nroom. The struggle was bitter; his teeth ground themselves together with\na little rasping sound; the blood sang in his ears; his face flushed\nscarlet; his hands twisted themselves together like the knotting of\ncables. The fury in him was as the fury of a young bull in the heat of\nhigh summer. But for all that he shook his huge head from time to time,\nmuttering:\n\n\"No, by God! No, by God!\"\n\nDimly he seemed to realize that should he yield now he would never be\nable to care for Trina again. She would never be the same to him, never\nso radiant, so sweet, so adorable; her charm for him would vanish in an\ninstant. Across her forehead, her little pale forehead, under the shadow\nof her royal hair, he would surely see the smudge of a foul ordure, the\nfootprint of the monster. It would be a sacrilege, an abomination. He\nrecoiled from it, banding all his strength to the issue.\n\n\"No, by God! No, by God!\"\n\nHe turned to his work, as if seeking a refuge in it. But as he drew near\nto her again, the charm of her innocence and helplessness came over\nhim afresh. It was a final protest against his resolution. Suddenly he\nleaned over and kissed her, grossly, full on the mouth. The thing was\ndone before he knew it. Terrified at his weakness at the very moment he\nbelieved himself strong, he threw himself once more into his work with\ndesperate energy. By the time he was fastening the sheet of rubber upon\nthe tooth, he had himself once more in hand. He was disturbed, still\ntrembling, still vibrating with the throes of the crisis, but he was the\nmaster; the animal was downed, was cowed for this time, at least.\n\nBut for all that, the brute was there. Long dormant, it was now at last\nalive, awake. From now on he would feel its presence continually; would\nfeel it tugging at its chain, watching its opportunity. Ah, the pity\nof it! Why could he not always love her purely, cleanly? What was this\nperverse, vicious thing that lived within him, knitted to his flesh?\n\nBelow the fine fabric of all that was good in him ran the foul stream of\nhereditary evil, like a sewer. The vices and sins of his father and\nof his father's father, to the third and fourth and five hundredth\ngeneration, tainted him. The evil of an entire race flowed in his veins.\nWhy should it be? He did not desire it. Was he to blame?\n\nBut McTeague could not understand this thing. It had faced him, as\nsooner or later it faces every child of man; but its significance was\nnot for him. To reason with it was beyond him. He could only oppose to\nit an instinctive stubborn resistance, blind, inert.\n\nMcTeague went on with his work. As he was rapping in the little blocks\nand cylinders with the mallet, Trina slowly came back to herself with a\nlong sigh. She still felt a little confused, and lay quiet in the chair.\nThere was a long silence, broken only by the uneven tapping of the\nhardwood mallet. By and by she said, \"I never felt a thing,\" and then\nshe smiled at him very prettily beneath the rubber dam. McTeague turned\nto her suddenly, his mallet in one hand, his pliers holding a pellet\nof sponge-gold in the other. All at once he said, with the unreasoned\nsimplicity and directness of a child: \"Listen here, Miss Trina, I\nlike you better than any one else; what's the matter with us getting\nmarried?\"\n\nTrina sat up in the chair quickly, and then drew back from him,\nfrightened and bewildered.\n\n\"Will you? Will you?\" said McTeague. \"Say, Miss Trina, will you?\"\n\n\"What is it? What do you mean?\" she cried, confusedly, her words muffled\nbeneath the rubber.\n\n\"Will you?\" repeated McTeague.\n\n\"No, no,\" she exclaimed, refusing without knowing why, suddenly seized\nwith a fear of him, the intuitive feminine fear of the male. McTeague\ncould only repeat the same thing over and over again. Trina, more\nand more frightened at his huge hands--the hands of the old-time\ncar-boy--his immense square-cut head and his enormous brute strength,\ncried out: \"No, no,\" behind the rubber dam, shaking her head violently,\nholding out her hands, and shrinking down before him in the operating\nchair. McTeague came nearer to her, repeating the same question. \"No,\nno,\" she cried, terrified. Then, as she exclaimed, \"Oh, I am sick,\"\nwas suddenly taken with a fit of vomiting. It was the not unusual\nafter effect of the ether, aided now by her excitement and nervousness.\nMcTeague was checked. He poured some bromide of potassium into a\ngraduated glass and held it to her lips.\n\n\"Here, swallow this,\" he said.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\n\nOnce every two months Maria Macapa set the entire flat in commotion.\nShe roamed the building from garret to cellar, searching each corner,\nferreting through every old box and trunk and barrel, groping about\non the top shelves of closets, peering into rag-bags, exasperating the\nlodgers with her persistence and importunity. She was collecting\njunks, bits of iron, stone jugs, glass bottles, old sacks, and cast-off\ngarments. It was one of her perquisites. She sold the junk to Zerkow,\nthe rags-bottles-sacks man, who lived in a filthy den in the alley just\nback of the flat, and who sometimes paid her as much as three cents\na pound. The stone jugs, however, were worth a nickel. The money that\nZerkow paid her, Maria spent on shirt waists and dotted blue neckties,\ntrying to dress like the girls who tended the soda-water fountain in the\ncandy store on the corner. She was sick with envy of these young women.\nThey were in the world, they were elegant, they were debonair, they had\ntheir \"young men.\"\n\nOn this occasion she presented herself at the door of Old Grannis's room\nlate in the afternoon. His door stood a little open. That of Miss Baker\nwas ajar a few inches. The two old people were \"keeping company\" after\ntheir fashion.\n\n\"Got any junk, Mister Grannis?\" inquired Maria, standing in the door, a\nvery dirty, half-filled pillowcase over one arm.\n\n\"No, nothing--nothing that I can think of, Maria,\" replied Old Grannis,\nterribly vexed at the interruption, yet not wishing to be unkind.\n\"Nothing I think of. Yet, however--perhaps--if you wish to look.\"\n\nHe sat in the middle of the room before a small pine table. His\nlittle binding apparatus was before him. In his fingers was a huge\nupholsterer's needle threaded with twine, a brad-awl lay at his elbow,\non the floor beside him was a great pile of pamphlets, the pages uncut.\nOld Grannis bought the \"Nation\" and the \"Breeder and Sportsman.\" In the\nlatter he occasionally found articles on dogs which interested him. The\nformer he seldom read. He could not afford to subscribe regularly to\neither of the publications, but purchased their back numbers by the\nscore, almost solely for the pleasure he took in binding them.\n\n\"What you alus sewing up them books for, Mister Grannis?\" asked Maria,\nas she began rummaging about in Old Grannis's closet shelves. \"There's\njust hundreds of 'em in here on yer shelves; they ain't no good to you.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" answered Old Grannis, timidly, rubbing his chin, \"I--I'm\nsure I can't quite say; a little habit, you know; a diversion, a--a--it\noccupies one, you know. I don't smoke; it takes the place of a pipe,\nperhaps.\"\n\n\"Here's this old yellow pitcher,\" said Maria, coming out of the closet\nwith it in her hand. \"The handle's cracked; you don't want it; better\ngive me it.\"\n\nOld Grannis did want the pitcher; true, he never used it now, but he\nhad kept it a long time, and somehow he held to it as old people hold to\ntrivial, worthless things that they have had for many years.\n\n\"Oh, that pitcher--well, Maria, I--I don't know. I'm afraid--you see,\nthat pitcher----\"\n\n\"Ah, go 'long,\" interrupted Maria Macapa, \"what's the good of it?\"\n\n\"If you insist, Maria, but I would much rather--\" he rubbed his chin,\nperplexed and annoyed, hating to refuse, and wishing that Maria were\ngone.\n\n\"Why, what's the good of it?\" persisted Maria. He could give no\nsufficient answer. \"That's all right,\" she asserted, carrying the\npitcher out.\n\n\"Ah--Maria--I say, you--you might leave the door--ah, don't quite shut\nit--it's a bit close in here at times.\" Maria grinned, and swung the\ndoor wide. Old Grannis was horribly embarrassed; positively, Maria was\nbecoming unbearable.\n\n\"Got any junk?\" cried Maria at Miss Baker's door. The little old lady\nwas sitting close to the wall in her rocking-chair; her hands resting\nidly in her lap.\n\n\"Now, Maria,\" she said plaintively, \"you are always after junk; you know\nI never have anything laying 'round like that.\"\n\nIt was true. The retired dressmaker's tiny room was a marvel of\nneatness, from the little red table, with its three Gorham spoons laid\nin exact parallels, to the decorous geraniums and mignonettes growing\nin the starch box at the window, underneath the fish globe with its\none venerable gold fish. That day Miss Baker had been doing a bit of\nwashing; two pocket handkerchiefs, still moist, adhered to the window\npanes, drying in the sun.\n\n\"Oh, I guess you got something you don't want,\" Maria went on, peering\ninto the corners of the room. \"Look-a-here what Mister Grannis gi'\nme,\" and she held out the yellow pitcher. Instantly Miss Baker was in a\nquiver of confusion. Every word spoken aloud could be perfectly heard in\nthe next room. What a stupid drab was this Maria! Could anything be more\ntrying than this position?\n\n\"Ain't that right, Mister Grannis?\" called Maria; \"didn't you gi' me\nthis pitcher?\" Old Grannis affected not to hear; perspiration stood on\nhis forehead; his timidity overcame him as if he were a ten-year-old\nschoolboy. He half rose from his chair, his fingers dancing nervously\nupon his chin.\n\nMaria opened Miss Baker's closet unconcernedly. \"What's the matter with\nthese old shoes?\" she exclaimed, turning about with a pair of half-worn\nsilk gaiters in her hand. They were by no means old enough to throw\naway, but Miss Baker was almost beside herself. There was no telling\nwhat might happen next. Her only thought was to be rid of Maria.\n\n\"Yes, yes, anything. You can have them; but go, go. There's nothing\nelse, not a thing.\"\n\nMaria went out into the hall, leaving Miss Baker's door wide open, as\nif maliciously. She had left the dirty pillow-case on the floor in the\nhall, and she stood outside, between the two open doors, stowing away\nthe old pitcher and the half-worn silk shoes. She made remarks at the\ntop of her voice, calling now to Miss Baker, now to Old Grannis. In a\nway she brought the two old people face to face. Each time they were\nforced to answer her questions it was as if they were talking directly\nto each other.\n\n\"These here are first-rate shoes, Miss Baker. Look here, Mister Grannis,\nget on to the shoes Miss Baker gi' me. You ain't got a pair you don't\nwant, have you? You two people have less junk than any one else in the\nflat. How do you manage, Mister Grannis? You old bachelors are just like\nold maids, just as neat as pins. You two are just alike--you and Mister\nGrannis--ain't you, Miss Baker?\"\n\nNothing could have been more horribly constrained, more awkward. The two\nold people suffered veritable torture. When Maria had gone, each heaved\na sigh of unspeakable relief. Softly they pushed to their doors, leaving\nopen a space of half a dozen inches. Old Grannis went back to his\nbinding. Miss Baker brewed a cup of tea to quiet her nerves. Each tried\nto regain their composure, but in vain. Old Grannis's fingers trembled\nso that he pricked them with his needle. Miss Baker dropped her spoon\ntwice. Their nervousness would not wear off. They were perturbed, upset.\nIn a word, the afternoon was spoiled.\n\nMaria went on about the flat from room to room. She had already paid\nMarcus Schouler a visit early that morning before he had gone out.\nMarcus had sworn at her, excitedly vociferating; \"No, by damn! No,\nhe hadn't a thing for her; he hadn't, for a fact. It was a positive\npersecution. Every day his privacy was invaded. He would complain to the\nlandlady, he would. He'd move out of the place.\" In the end he had given\nMaria seven empty whiskey flasks, an iron grate, and ten cents--the\nlatter because he said she wore her hair like a girl he used to know.\n\nAfter coming from Miss Baker's room Maria knocked at McTeague's door.\nThe dentist was lying on the bed-lounge in his stocking feet, doing\nnothing apparently, gazing up at the ceiling, lost in thought.\n\nSince he had spoken to Trina Sieppe, asking her so abruptly to marry\nhim, McTeague had passed a week of torment. For him there was no going\nback. It was Trina now, and none other. It was all one with him that his\nbest friend, Marcus, might be in love with the same girl. He must\nhave Trina in spite of everything; he would have her even in spite of\nherself. He did not stop to reflect about the matter; he followed his\ndesire blindly, recklessly, furious and raging at every obstacle. And\nshe had cried \"No, no!\" back at him; he could not forget that. She, so\nsmall and pale and delicate, had held him at bay, who was so huge, so\nimmensely strong.\n\nBesides that, all the charm of their intimacy was gone. After that\nunhappy sitting, Trina was no longer frank and straight-forward. Now she\nwas circumspect, reserved, distant. He could no longer open his mouth;\nwords failed him. At one sitting in particular they had said but\ngood-day and good-by to each other. He felt that he was clumsy and\nungainly. He told himself that she despised him.\n\nBut the memory of her was with him constantly. Night after night he\nlay broad awake thinking of Trina, wondering about her, racked with the\ninfinite desire of her. His head burnt and throbbed. The palms of his\nhands were dry. He dozed and woke, and walked aimlessly about the dark\nroom, bruising himself against the three chairs drawn up \"at attention\"\nunder the steel engraving, and stumbling over the stone pug dog that sat\nin front of the little stove.\n\nBesides this, the jealousy of Marcus Schouler harassed him. Maria\nMacapa, coming into his \"Parlor\" to ask for junk, found him flung at\nlength upon the bed-lounge, gnawing at his fingers in an excess of\nsilent fury. At lunch that day Marcus had told him of an excursion that\nwas planned for the next Sunday afternoon. Mr. Sieppe, Trina's father,\nbelonged to a rifle club that was to hold a meet at Schuetzen Park\nacross the bay. All the Sieppes were going; there was to be a basket\npicnic. Marcus, as usual, was invited to be one of the party. McTeague\nwas in agony. It was his first experience, and he suffered all the worse\nfor it because he was totally unprepared. What miserable complication\nwas this in which he found himself involved? It seemed so simple to\nhim since he loved Trina to take her straight to himself, stopping at\nnothing, asking no questions, to have her, and by main strength to carry\nher far away somewhere, he did not know exactly where, to some vague\ncountry, some undiscovered place where every day was Sunday.\n\n\"Got any junk?\"\n\n\"Huh? What? What is it?\" exclaimed McTeague, suddenly rousing up from\nthe lounge. Often Maria did very well in the \"Dental Parlors.\" McTeague\nwas continually breaking things which he was too stupid to have mended;\nfor him anything that was broken was lost. Now it was a cuspidor, now a\nfire-shovel for the little stove, now a China shaving mug.\n\n\"Got any junk?\"\n\n\"I don't know--I don't remember,\" muttered McTeague. Maria roamed about\nthe room, McTeague following her in his huge stockinged feet. All at\nonce she pounced upon a sheaf of old hand instruments in a coverless\ncigar-box, pluggers, hard bits, and excavators. Maria had long coveted\nsuch a find in McTeague's \"Parlor,\" knowing it should be somewhere\nabout. The instruments were of the finest tempered steel and really\nvaluable.\n\n\"Say, Doctor, I can have these, can't I?\" exclaimed Maria. \"You got no\nmore use for them.\" McTeague was not at all sure of this. There were\nmany in the sheaf that might be repaired, reshaped.\n\n\"No, no,\" he said, wagging his head. But Maria Macapa, knowing with\nwhom she had to deal, at once let loose a torrent of words. She made\nthe dentist believe that he had no right to withhold them, that he had\npromised to save them for her. She affected a great indignation, pursing\nher lips and putting her chin in the air as though wounded in some finer\nsense, changing so rapidly from one mood to another, filling the room\nwith such shrill clamor, that McTeague was dazed and benumbed.\n\n\"Yes, all right, all right,\" he said, trying to make himself heard. \"It\nWOULD be mean. I don't want 'em.\" As he turned from her to pick up\nthe box, Maria took advantage of the moment to steal three \"mats\" of\nsponge-gold out of the glass saucer. Often she stole McTeague's gold,\nalmost under his very eyes; indeed, it was so easy to do so that there\nwas but little pleasure in the theft. Then Maria took herself off.\nMcTeague returned to the sofa and flung himself upon it face downward.\n\nA little before supper time Maria completed her search. The flat was\ncleaned of its junk from top to bottom. The dirty pillow-case was full\nto bursting. She took advantage of the supper hour to carry her bundle\naround the corner and up into the alley where Zerkow lived.\n\nWhen Maria entered his shop, Zerkow had just come in from his daily\nrounds. His decrepit wagon stood in front of his door like a stranded\nwreck; the miserable horse, with its lamentable swollen joints, fed\ngreedily upon an armful of spoiled hay in a shed at the back.\n\nThe interior of the junk shop was dark and damp, and foul with all\nmanner of choking odors. On the walls, on the floor, and hanging from\nthe rafters was a world of debris, dust-blackened, rust-corroded.\nEverything was there, every trade was represented, every class of\nsociety; things of iron and cloth and wood; all the detritus that a\ngreat city sloughs off in its daily life. Zerkow's junk shop was the\nlast abiding-place, the almshouse, of such articles as had outlived\ntheir usefulness.\n\nMaria found Zerkow himself in the back room, cooking some sort of a meal\nover an alcohol stove. Zerkow was a Polish Jew--curiously enough his\nhair was fiery red. He was a dry, shrivelled old man of sixty odd. He\nhad the thin, eager, cat-like lips of the covetous; eyes that had grown\nkeen as those of a lynx from long searching amidst muck and debris; and\nclaw-like, prehensile fingers--the fingers of a man who accumulates,\nbut never disburses. It was impossible to look at Zerkow and not know\ninstantly that greed--inordinate, insatiable greed--was the dominant\npassion of the man. He was the Man with the Rake, groping hourly in the\nmuck-heap of the city for gold, for gold, for gold. It was his dream,\nhis passion; at every instant he seemed to feel the generous solid\nweight of the crude fat metal in his palms. The glint of it was\nconstantly in his eyes; the jangle of it sang forever in his ears as the\njangling of cymbals.\n\n\"Who is it? Who is it?\" exclaimed Zerkow, as he heard Maria's footsteps\nin the outer room. His voice was faint, husky, reduced almost to a\nwhisper by his prolonged habit of street crying.\n\n\"Oh, it's you again, is it?\" he added, peering through the gloom of the\nshop. \"Let's see; you've been here before, ain't you? You're the Mexican\nwoman from Polk Street. Macapa's your name, hey?\"\n\nMaria nodded. \"Had a flying squirrel an' let him go,\" she muttered,\nabsently. Zerkow was puzzled; he looked at her sharply for a moment,\nthen dismissed the matter with a movement of his head.\n\n\"Well, what you got for me?\" he said. He left his supper to grow cold,\nabsorbed at once in the affair.\n\nThen a long wrangle began. Every bit of junk in Maria's pillow-case\nwas discussed and weighed and disputed. They clamored into each other's\nfaces over Old Grannis's cracked pitcher, over Miss Baker's silk\ngaiters, over Marcus Schouler's whiskey flasks, reaching the climax of\ndisagreement when it came to McTeague's instruments.\n\n\"Ah, no, no!\" shouted Maria. \"Fifteen cents for the lot! I might as well\nmake you a Christmas present! Besides, I got some gold fillings off him;\nlook at um.\"\n\nZerkow drew a quick breath as the three pellets suddenly flashed in\nMaria's palm. There it was, the virgin metal, the pure, unalloyed\nore, his dream, his consuming desire. His fingers twitched and hooked\nthemselves into his palms, his thin lips drew tight across his teeth.\n\n\"Ah, you got some gold,\" he muttered, reaching for it.\n\nMaria shut her fist over the pellets. \"The gold goes with the others,\"\nshe declared. \"You'll gi' me a fair price for the lot, or I'll take um\nback.\"\n\nIn the end a bargain was struck that satisfied Maria. Zerkow was not one\nwho would let gold go out of his house. He counted out to her the price\nof all her junk, grudging each piece of money as if it had been the\nblood of his veins. The affair was concluded.\n\nBut Zerkow still had something to say. As Maria folded up the\npillow-case and rose to go, the old Jew said:\n\n\"Well, see here a minute, we'll--you'll have a drink before you go,\nwon't you? Just to show that it's all right between us.\" Maria sat down\nagain.\n\n\"Yes, I guess I'll have a drink,\" she answered.\n\nZerkow took down a whiskey bottle and a red glass tumbler with a broken\nbase from a cupboard on the wall. The two drank together, Zerkow from\nthe bottle, Maria from the broken tumbler. They wiped their lips slowly,\ndrawing breath again. There was a moment's silence.\n\n\"Say,\" said Zerkow at last, \"how about those gold dishes you told me\nabout the last time you were here?\"\n\n\"What gold dishes?\" inquired Maria, puzzled.\n\n\"Ah, you know,\" returned the other. \"The plate your father owned in\nCentral America a long time ago. Don't you know, it rang like so many\nbells? Red gold, you know, like oranges?\"\n\n\"Ah,\" said Maria, putting her chin in the air as if she knew a long\nstory about that if she had a mind to tell it. \"Ah, yes, that gold\nservice.\"\n\n\"Tell us about it again,\" said Zerkow, his bloodless lower lip moving\nagainst the upper, his claw-like fingers feeling about his mouth and\nchin. \"Tell us about it; go on.\"\n\nHe was breathing short, his limbs trembled a little. It was as if some\nhungry beast of prey had scented a quarry. Maria still refused, putting\nup her head, insisting that she had to be going.\n\n\"Let's have it,\" insisted the Jew. \"Take another drink.\" Maria took\nanother swallow of the whiskey. \"Now, go on,\" repeated Zerkow; \"let's\nhave the story.\" Maria squared her elbows on the deal table, looking\nstraight in front of her with eyes that saw nothing.\n\n\"Well, it was this way,\" she began. \"It was when I was little. My folks\nmust have been rich, oh, rich into the millions--coffee, I guess--and\nthere was a large house, but I can only remember the plate. Oh, that\nservice of plate! It was wonderful. There were more than a hundred\npieces, and every one of them gold. You should have seen the sight when\nthe leather trunk was opened. It fair dazzled your eyes. It was a yellow\nblaze like a fire, like a sunset; such a glory, all piled up together,\none piece over the other. Why, if the room was dark you'd think you\ncould see just the same with all that glitter there. There wa'n't a\npiece that was so much as scratched; every one was like a mirror, smooth\nand bright, just like a little pool when the sun shines into it. There\nwas dinner dishes and soup tureens and pitchers; and great, big platters\nas long as that and wide too; and cream-jugs and bowls with carved\nhandles, all vines and things; and drinking mugs, every one a different\nshape; and dishes for gravy and sauces; and then a great, big punch-bowl\nwith a ladle, and the bowl was all carved out with figures and bunches\nof grapes. Why, just only that punch-bowl was worth a fortune, I guess.\nWhen all that plate was set out on a table, it was a sight for a king to\nlook at. Such a service as that was! Each piece was heavy, oh, so heavy!\nand thick, you know; thick, fat gold, nothing but gold--red, shining,\npure gold, orange red--and when you struck it with your knuckle, ah, you\nshould have heard! No church bell ever rang sweeter or clearer. It\nwas soft gold, too; you could bite into it, and leave the dent of your\nteeth. Oh, that gold plate! I can see it just as plain--solid, solid,\nheavy, rich, pure gold; nothing but gold, gold, heaps and heaps of it.\nWhat a service that was!\"\n\nMaria paused, shaking her head, thinking over the vanished splendor.\nIlliterate enough, unimaginative enough on all other subjects, her\ndistorted wits called up this picture with marvellous distinctness. It\nwas plain she saw the plate clearly. Her description was accurate, was\nalmost eloquent.\n\nDid that wonderful service of gold plate ever exist outside of her\ndiseased imagination? Was Maria actually remembering some reality of a\nchildhood of barbaric luxury? Were her parents at one time possessed\nof an incalculable fortune derived from some Central American\ncoffee plantation, a fortune long since confiscated by armies of\ninsurrectionists, or squandered in the support of revolutionary\ngovernments?\n\nIt was not impossible. Of Maria Macapa's past prior to the time of\nher appearance at the \"flat\" absolutely nothing could be learned. She\nsuddenly appeared from the unknown, a strange woman of a mixed race,\nsane on all subjects but that of the famous service of gold plate; but\nunusual, complex, mysterious, even at her best.\n\nBut what misery Zerkow endured as he listened to her tale! For he chose\nto believe it, forced himself to believe it, lashed and harassed by\na pitiless greed that checked at no tale of treasure, however\npreposterous. The story ravished him with delight. He was near someone\nwho had possessed this wealth. He saw someone who had seen this pile\nof gold. He seemed near it; it was there, somewhere close by, under his\neyes, under his fingers; it was red, gleaming, ponderous. He gazed\nabout him wildly; nothing, nothing but the sordid junk shop and the\nrust-corroded tins. What exasperation, what positive misery, to be so\nnear to it and yet to know that it was irrevocably, irretrievably lost!\nA spasm of anguish passed through him. He gnawed at his bloodless lips,\nat the hopelessness of it, the rage, the fury of it.\n\n\"Go on, go on,\" he whispered; \"let's have it all over again. Polished\nlike a mirror, hey, and heavy? Yes, I know, I know. A punch-bowl worth a\nfortune. Ah! and you saw it, you had it all!\"\n\nMaria rose to go. Zerkow accompanied her to the door, urging another\ndrink upon her.\n\n\"Come again, come again,\" he croaked. \"Don't wait till you've got junk;\ncome any time you feel like it, and tell me more about the plate.\"\n\nHe followed her a step down the alley.\n\n\"How much do you think it was worth?\" he inquired, anxiously.\n\n\"Oh, a million dollars,\" answered Maria, vaguely.\n\nWhen Maria had gone, Zerkow returned to the back room of the shop, and\nstood in front of the alcohol stove, looking down into his cold dinner,\npreoccupied, thoughtful.\n\n\"A million dollars,\" he muttered in his rasping, guttural whisper, his\nfinger-tips wandering over his thin, cat-like lips. \"A golden service\nworth a million dollars; a punchbowl worth a fortune; red gold plates,\nheaps and piles. God!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\n\nThe days passed. McTeague had finished the operation on Trina's teeth.\nShe did not come any more to the \"Parlors.\" Matters had readjusted\nthemselves a little between the two during the last sittings. Trina yet\nstood upon her reserve, and McTeague still felt himself shambling and\nungainly in her presence; but that constraint and embarrassment that\nhad followed upon McTeague's blundering declaration broke up little by\nlittle. In spite of themselves they were gradually resuming the same\nrelative positions they had occupied when they had first met.\n\nBut McTeague suffered miserably for all that. He never would have\nTrina, he saw that clearly. She was too good for him; too delicate, too\nrefined, too prettily made for him, who was so coarse, so enormous, so\nstupid. She was for someone else--Marcus, no doubt--or at least for some\nfiner-grained man. She should have gone to some other dentist; the young\nfellow on the corner, for instance, the poser, the rider of bicycles,\nthe courser of grey-hounds. McTeague began to loathe and to envy this\nfellow. He spied upon him going in and out of his office, and noted his\nsalmon-pink neckties and his astonishing waistcoats.\n\nOne Sunday, a few days after Trina's last sitting, McTeague met Marcus\nSchouler at his table in the car conductors' coffee-joint, next to the\nharness shop.\n\n\"What you got to do this afternoon, Mac?\" inquired the other, as they\nate their suet pudding.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" replied McTeague, shaking his head. His mouth\nwas full of pudding. It made him warm to eat, and little beads of\nperspiration stood across the bridge of his nose. He looked forward\nto an afternoon passed in his operating chair as usual. On leaving\nhis \"Parlors\" he had put ten cents into his pitcher and had left it at\nFrenna's to be filled.\n\n\"What do you say we take a walk, huh?\" said Marcus. \"Ah, that's the\nthing--a walk, a long walk, by damn! It'll be outa sight. I got to take\nthree or four of the dogs out for exercise, anyhow. Old Grannis thinks\nthey need ut. We'll walk out to the Presidio.\"\n\nOf late it had become the custom of the two friends to take long walks\nfrom time to time. On holidays and on those Sunday afternoons when\nMarcus was not absent with the Sieppes they went out together, sometimes\nto the park, sometimes to the Presidio, sometimes even across the bay.\nThey took a great pleasure in each other's company, but silently and\nwith reservation, having the masculine horror of any demonstration of\nfriendship.\n\nThey walked for upwards of five hours that afternoon, out the length\nof California Street, and across the Presidio Reservation to the Golden\nGate. Then they turned, and, following the line of the shore, brought up\nat the Cliff House. Here they halted for beer, Marcus swearing that his\nmouth was as dry as a hay-bin. Before starting on their walk they had\ngone around to the little dog hospital, and Marcus had let out four of\nthe convalescents, crazed with joy at the release.\n\n\"Look at that dog,\" he cried to McTeague, showing him a finely-bred\nIrish setter. \"That's the dog that belonged to the duck on the avenue,\nthe dog we called for that day. I've bought 'um. The duck thought he\nhad the distemper, and just threw 'um away. Nothun wrong with 'um but a\nlittle catarrh. Ain't he a bird? Say, ain't he a bird? Look at his flag;\nit's perfect; and see how he carries his tail on a line with his back.\nSee how stiff and white his whiskers are. Oh, by damn! you can't fool me\non a dog. That dog's a winner.\"\n\nAt the Cliff House the two sat down to their beer in a quiet corner of\nthe billiard-room. There were but two players. Somewhere in another part\nof the building a mammoth music-box was jangling out a quickstep. From\noutside came the long, rhythmical rush of the surf and the sonorous\nbarking of the seals upon the seal rocks. The four dogs curled\nthemselves down upon the sanded floor.\n\n\"Here's how,\" said Marcus, half emptying his glass. \"Ah-h!\" he added,\nwith a long breath, \"that's good; it is, for a fact.\"\n\nFor the last hour of their walk Marcus had done nearly all the talking.\nMcTeague merely answering him by uncertain movements of the head. For\nthat matter, the dentist had been silent and preoccupied throughout the\nwhole afternoon. At length Marcus noticed it. As he set down his glass\nwith a bang he suddenly exclaimed:\n\n\"What's the matter with you these days, Mac? You got a bean about\nsomethun, hey? Spit ut out.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" replied McTeague, looking about on the floor, rolling his\neyes; \"nothing, no, no.\"\n\n\"Ah, rats!\" returned the other. McTeague kept silence. The two billiard\nplayers departed. The huge music-box struck into a fresh tune.\n\n\"Huh!\" exclaimed Marcus, with a short laugh, \"guess you're in love.\"\n\nMcTeague gasped, and shuffled his enormous feet under the table.\n\n\"Well, somethun's bitun you, anyhow,\" pursued Marcus. \"Maybe I can\nhelp you. We're pals, you know. Better tell me what's up; guess we can\nstraighten ut out. Ah, go on; spit ut out.\"\n\nThe situation was abominable. McTeague could not rise to it. Marcus was\nhis best friend, his only friend. They were \"pals\" and McTeague was very\nfond of him. Yet they were both in love, presumably, with the same girl,\nand now Marcus would try and force the secret out of him; would rush\nblindly at the rock upon which the two must split, stirred by the very\nbest of motives, wishing only to be of service. Besides this, there was\nnobody to whom McTeague would have better preferred to tell his troubles\nthan to Marcus, and yet about this trouble, the greatest trouble of his\nlife, he must keep silent; must refrain from speaking of it to Marcus\nabove everybody.\n\nMcTeague began dimly to feel that life was too much for him. How had it\nall come about? A month ago he was perfectly content; he was calm and\npeaceful, taking his little pleasures as he found them. His life had\nshaped itself; was, no doubt, to continue always along these same lines.\nA woman had entered his small world and instantly there was discord. The\ndisturbing element had appeared. Wherever the woman had put her foot a\nscore of distressing complications had sprung up, like the sudden growth\nof strange and puzzling flowers.\n\n\"Say, Mac, go on; let's have ut straight,\" urged Marcus, leaning toward\nhim. \"Has any duck been doing you dirt?\" he cried, his face crimson on\nthe instant.\n\n\"No,\" said McTeague, helplessly.\n\n\"Come along, old man,\" persisted Marcus; \"let's have ut. What is the\nrow? I'll do all I can to help you.\"\n\nIt was more than McTeague could bear. The situation had got beyond\nhim. Stupidly he spoke, his hands deep in his pockets, his head rolled\nforward.\n\n\"It's--it's Miss Sieppe,\" he said.\n\n\"Trina, my cousin? How do you mean?\" inquired Marcus sharply.\n\n\"I--I--I don' know,\" stammered McTeague, hopelessly confounded.\n\n\"You mean,\" cried Marcus, suddenly enlightened, \"that you are--that you,\ntoo.\"\n\nMcTeague stirred in his chair, looking at the walls of the room,\navoiding the other's glance. He nodded his head, then suddenly broke\nout:\n\n\"I can't help it. It ain't my fault, is it?\"\n\nMarcus was struck dumb; he dropped back in his chair breathless.\nSuddenly McTeague found his tongue.\n\n\"I tell you, Mark, I can't help it. I don't know how it happened. It\ncame on so slow that I was, that--that--that it was done before I knew\nit, before I could help myself. I know we're pals, us two, and I knew\nhow--how you and Miss Sieppe were. I know now, I knew then; but that\nwouldn't have made any difference. Before I knew it--it--it--there I\nwas. I can't help it. I wouldn't 'a' had ut happen for anything, if\nI could 'a' stopped it, but I don' know, it's something that's just\nstronger than you are, that's all. She came there--Miss Sieppe came to\nthe parlors there three or four times a week, and she was the first\ngirl I had ever known,--and you don' know! Why, I was so close to her I\ntouched her face every minute, and her mouth, and smelt her hair and her\nbreath--oh, you don't know anything about it. I can't give you any idea.\nI don' know exactly myself; I only know how I'm fixed. I--I--it's\nbeen done; it's too late, there's no going back. Why, I can't think\nof anything else night and day. It's everything. It's--it's--oh, it's\neverything! I--I--why, Mark, it's everything--I can't explain.\" He made\na helpless movement with both hands.\n\nNever had McTeague been so excited; never had he made so long a speech.\nHis arms moved in fierce, uncertain gestures, his face flushed, his\nenormous jaws shut together with a sharp click at every pause. It was\nlike some colossal brute trapped in a delicate, invisible mesh, raging,\nexasperated, powerless to extricate himself.\n\nMarcus Schouler said nothing. There was a long silence. Marcus got up\nand walked to the window and stood looking out, but seeing nothing.\n\"Well, who would have thought of this?\" he muttered under his breath.\nHere was a fix. Marcus cared for Trina. There was no doubt in his\nmind about that. He looked forward eagerly to the Sunday afternoon\nexcursions. He liked to be with Trina. He, too, felt the charm of the\nlittle girl--the charm of the small, pale forehead; the little chin\nthrust out as if in confidence and innocence; the heavy, odorous crown\nof black hair. He liked her immensely. Some day he would speak; he would\nask her to marry him. Marcus put off this matter of marriage to some\nfuture period; it would be some time--a year, perhaps, or two. The thing\ndid not take definite shape in his mind. Marcus \"kept company\" with his\ncousin Trina, but he knew plenty of other girls. For the matter of that,\nhe liked all girls pretty well. Just now the singleness and strength of\nMcTeague's passion startled him. McTeague would marry Trina that very\nafternoon if she would have him; but would he--Marcus? No, he would not;\nif it came to that, no, he would not. Yet he knew he liked Trina. He\ncould say--yes, he could say--he loved her. She was his \"girl.\" The\nSieppes acknowledged him as Trina's \"young man.\" Marcus came back to the\ntable and sat down sideways upon it.\n\n\"Well, what are we going to do about it, Mac?\" he said.\n\n\"I don' know,\" answered McTeague, in great distress. \"I don' want\nanything to--to come between us, Mark.\"\n\n\"Well, nothun will, you bet!\" vociferated the other. \"No, sir; you bet\nnot, Mac.\"\n\nMarcus was thinking hard. He could see very clearly that McTeague loved\nTrina more than he did; that in some strange way this huge, brutal\nfellow was capable of a greater passion than himself, who was twice as\nclever. Suddenly Marcus jumped impetuously to a resolution.\n\n\"Well, say, Mac,\" he cried, striking the table with his fist, \"go ahead.\nI guess you--you want her pretty bad. I'll pull out; yes, I will. I'll\ngive her up to you, old man.\"\n\nThe sense of his own magnanimity all at once overcame Marcus. He saw\nhimself as another man, very noble, self-sacrificing; he stood apart\nand watched this second self with boundless admiration and with infinite\npity. He was so good, so magnificent, so heroic, that he almost sobbed.\nMarcus made a sweeping gesture of resignation, throwing out both his\narms, crying:\n\n\"Mac, I'll give her up to you. I won't stand between you.\" There were\nactually tears in Marcus's eyes as he spoke. There was no doubt he\nthought himself sincere. At that moment he almost believed he loved\nTrina conscientiously, that he was sacrificing himself for the sake of\nhis friend. The two stood up and faced each other, gripping hands. It\nwas a great moment; even McTeague felt the drama of it. What a fine\nthing was this friendship between men! the dentist treats his friend\nfor an ulcerated tooth and refuses payment; the friend reciprocates by\ngiving up his girl. This was nobility. Their mutual affection and esteem\nsuddenly increased enormously. It was Damon and Pythias; it was David\nand Jonathan; nothing could ever estrange them. Now it was for life or\ndeath.\n\n\"I'm much obliged,\" murmured McTeague. He could think of nothing better\nto say. \"I'm much obliged,\" he repeated; \"much obliged, Mark.\"\n\n\"That's all right, that's all right,\" returned Marcus Schouler, bravely,\nand it occurred to him to add, \"You'll be happy together. Tell her\nfor me--tell her---tell her----\" Marcus could not go on. He wrung the\ndentist's hand silently.\n\nIt had not appeared to either of them that Trina might refuse McTeague.\nMcTeague's spirits rose at once. In Marcus's withdrawal he fancied he\nsaw an end to all his difficulties. Everything would come right, after\nall. The strained, exalted state of Marcus's nerves ended by putting\nhim into fine humor as well. His grief suddenly changed to an excess of\ngaiety. The afternoon was a success. They slapped each other on the back\nwith great blows of the open palms, and they drank each other's health\nin a third round of beer.\n\nTen minutes after his renunciation of Trina Sieppe, Marcus astounded\nMcTeague with a tremendous feat.\n\n\"Looka here, Mac. I know somethun you can't do. I'll bet you two bits\nI'll stump you.\" They each put a quarter on the table. \"Now watch me,\"\ncried Marcus. He caught up a billiard ball from the rack, poised it a\nmoment in front of his face, then with a sudden, horrifying distension\nof his jaws crammed it into his mouth, and shut his lips over it.\n\nFor an instant McTeague was stupefied, his eyes bulging. Then an\nenormous laugh shook him. He roared and shouted, swaying in his chair,\nslapping his knee. What a josher was this Marcus! Sure, you never could\ntell what he would do next. Marcus slipped the ball out, wiped it on the\ntablecloth, and passed it to McTeague.\n\n\"Now let's see you do it.\"\n\nMcTeague fell suddenly grave. The matter was serious. He parted his\nthick mustaches and opened his enormous jaws like an anaconda. The ball\ndisappeared inside his mouth. Marcus applauded vociferously, shouting,\n\"Good work!\" McTeague reached for the money and put it in his vest\npocket, nodding his head with a knowing air.\n\nThen suddenly his face grew purple, his jaws moved convulsively, he\npawed at his cheeks with both hands. The billiard ball had slipped into\nhis mouth easily enough; now, however, he could not get it out again.\n\nIt was terrible. The dentist rose to his feet, stumbling about among the\ndogs, his face working, his eyes starting. Try as he would, he could not\nstretch his jaws wide enough to slip the ball out. Marcus lost his\nwits, swearing at the top of his voice. McTeague sweated with terror;\ninarticulate sounds came from his crammed mouth; he waved his arms\nwildly; all the four dogs caught the excitement and began to bark. A\nwaiter rushed in, the two billiard players returned, a little crowd\nformed. There was a veritable scene.\n\nAll at once the ball slipped out of McTeague's jaws as easily as it had\ngone in. What a relief! He dropped into a chair, wiping his forehead,\ngasping for breath.\n\nOn the strength of the occasion Marcus Schouler invited the entire group\nto drink with him.\n\nBy the time the affair was over and the group dispersed it was after\nfive. Marcus and McTeague decided they would ride home on the cars.\nBut they soon found this impossible. The dogs would not follow. Only\nAlexander, Marcus's new setter, kept his place at the rear of the car.\nThe other three lost their senses immediately, running wildly about\nthe streets with their heads in the air, or suddenly starting off at a\nfurious gallop directly away from the car. Marcus whistled and shouted\nand lathered with rage in vain. The two friends were obliged to walk.\nWhen they finally reached Polk Street, Marcus shut up the three dogs in\nthe hospital. Alexander he brought back to the flat with him.\n\nThere was a minute back yard in the rear, where Marcus had made a kennel\nfor Alexander out of an old water barrel. Before he thought of his own\nsupper Marcus put Alexander to bed and fed him a couple of dog biscuits.\nMcTeague had followed him to the yard to keep him company. Alexander\nsettled to his supper at once, chewing vigorously at the biscuit, his\nhead on one side.\n\n\"What you going to do about this--about that--about--about my cousin\nnow, Mac?\" inquired Marcus.\n\nMcTeague shook his head helplessly. It was dark by now and cold. The\nlittle back yard was grimy and full of odors. McTeague was tired with\ntheir long walk. All his uneasiness about his affair with Trina had\nreturned. No, surely she was not for him. Marcus or some other man would\nwin her in the end. What could she ever see to desire in him--in him, a\nclumsy giant, with hands like wooden mallets? She had told him once that\nshe would not marry him. Was that not final?\n\n\"I don' know what to do, Mark,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, you must make up to her now,\" answered Marcus. \"Go and call on\nher.\"\n\nMcTeague started. He had not thought of calling on her. The idea\nfrightened him a little.\n\n\"Of course,\" persisted Marcus, \"that's the proper caper. What did you\nexpect? Did you think you was never going to see her again?\"\n\n\"I don' know, I don' know,\" responded the dentist, looking stupidly at\nthe dog.\n\n\"You know where they live,\" continued Marcus Schouler. \"Over at B Street\nstation, across the bay. I'll take you over there whenever you want to\ngo. I tell you what, we'll go over there Washington's Birthday. That's\nthis next Wednesday; sure, they'll be glad to see you.\" It was good of\nMarcus. All at once McTeague rose to an appreciation of what his friend\nwas doing for him. He stammered:\n\n\"Say, Mark--you're--you're all right, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Why, pshaw!\" said Marcus. \"That's all right, old man. I'd like to see\nyou two fixed, that's all. We'll go over Wednesday, sure.\"\n\nThey turned back to the house. Alexander left off eating and watched\nthem go away, first with one eye, then with the other. But he was too\nself-respecting to whimper. However, by the time the two friends had\nreached the second landing on the back stairs a terrible commotion was\nunder way in the little yard. They rushed to an open window at the end\nof the hall and looked down.\n\nA thin board fence separated the flat's back yard from that used by\nthe branch post-office. In the latter place lived a collie dog. He and\nAlexander had smelt each other out, blowing through the cracks of the\nfence at each other. Suddenly the quarrel had exploded on either side of\nthe fence. The dogs raged at each other, snarling and barking, frantic\nwith hate. Their teeth gleamed. They tore at the fence with their front\npaws. They filled the whole night with their clamor.\n\n\"By damn!\" cried Marcus, \"they don't love each other. Just listen;\nwouldn't that make a fight if the two got together? Have to try it some\nday.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\n\nWednesday morning, Washington's Birthday, McTeague rose very early and\nshaved himself. Besides the six mournful concertina airs, the dentist\nknew one song. Whenever he shaved, he sung this song; never at any other\ntime. His voice was a bellowing roar, enough to make the window sashes\nrattle. Just now he woke up all the lodgers in his hall with it. It was\na lamentable wail:\n\n     \"No one to love, none to caress,\n     Left all alone in this world's wilderness.\"\n\nAs he paused to strop his razor, Marcus came into his room,\nhalf-dressed, a startling phantom in red flannels.\n\nMarcus often ran back and forth between his room and the dentist's\n\"Parlors\" in all sorts of undress. Old Miss Baker had seen him thus\nseveral times through her half-open door, as she sat in her room\nlistening and waiting. The old dressmaker was shocked out of all\nexpression. She was outraged, offended, pursing her lips, putting up her\nhead. She talked of complaining to the landlady. \"And Mr. Grannis right\nnext door, too. You can understand how trying it is for both of us.\" She\nwould come out in the hall after one of these apparitions, her little\nfalse curls shaking, talking loud and shrill to any one in reach of her\nvoice.\n\n\"Well,\" Marcus would shout, \"shut your door, then, if you don't want to\nsee. Look out, now, here I come again. Not even a porous plaster on me\nthis time.\"\n\nOn this Wednesday morning Marcus called McTeague out into the hall, to\nthe head of the stairs that led down to the street door.\n\n\"Come and listen to Maria, Mac,\" said he.\n\nMaria sat on the next to the lowest step, her chin propped by her\ntwo fists. The red-headed Polish Jew, the ragman Zerkow, stood in the\ndoorway. He was talking eagerly.\n\n\"Now, just once more, Maria,\" he was saying. \"Tell it to us just once\nmore.\" Maria's voice came up the stairway in a monotone. Marcus and\nMcTeague caught a phrase from time to time.\n\n\"There were more than a hundred pieces, and every one of them gold--just\nthat punch-bowl was worth a fortune-thick, fat, red gold.\"\n\n\"Get onto to that, will you?\" observed Marcus. \"The old skin has got her\nstarted on the plate. Ain't they a pair for you?\"\n\n\"And it rang like bells, didn't it?\" prompted Zerkow.\n\n\"Sweeter'n church bells, and clearer.\"\n\n\"Ah, sweeter'n bells. Wasn't that punch-bowl awful heavy?\"\n\n\"All you could do to lift it.\"\n\n\"I know. Oh, I know,\" answered Zerkow, clawing at his lips. \"Where did\nit all go to? Where did it go?\"\n\nMaria shook her head.\n\n\"It's gone, anyhow.\"\n\n\"Ah, gone, gone! Think of it! The punch-bowl gone, and the engraved\nladle, and the plates and goblets. What a sight it must have been all\nheaped together!\"\n\n\"It was a wonderful sight.\"\n\n\"Yes, wonderful; it must have been.\"\n\nOn the lower steps of that cheap flat, the Mexican woman and the\nred-haired Polish Jew mused long over that vanished, half-mythical gold\nplate.\n\nMarcus and the dentist spent Washington's Birthday across the bay. The\njourney over was one long agony to McTeague. He shook with a formless,\nuncertain dread; a dozen times he would have turned back had not Marcus\nbeen with him. The stolid giant was as nervous as a schoolboy. He\nfancied that his call upon Miss Sieppe was an outrageous affront. She\nwould freeze him with a stare; he would be shown the door, would be\nejected, disgraced.\n\nAs they got off the local train at B Street station they suddenly\ncollided with the whole tribe of Sieppes--the mother, father, three\nchildren, and Trina--equipped for one of their eternal picnics. They\nwere to go to Schuetzen Park, within walking distance of the station.\nThey were grouped about four lunch baskets. One of the children, a\nlittle boy, held a black greyhound by a rope around its neck. Trina wore\na blue cloth skirt, a striped shirt waist, and a white sailor; about her\nround waist was a belt of imitation alligator skin.\n\nAt once Mrs. Sieppe began to talk to Marcus. He had written of their\ncoming, but the picnic had been decided upon after the arrival of his\nletter. Mrs. Sieppe explained this to him. She was an immense old lady\nwith a pink face and wonderful hair, absolutely white. The Sieppes were\na German-Swiss family.\n\n\"We go to der park, Schuetzen Park, mit alle dem childern, a little\neggs-kursion, eh not soh? We breathe der freshes air, a celubration, a\npignic bei der seashore on. Ach, dot wull be soh gay, ah?\"\n\n\"You bet it will. It'll be outa sight,\" cried Marcus, enthusiastic in\nan instant. \"This is m' friend Doctor McTeague I wrote you about, Mrs.\nSieppe.\"\n\n\"Ach, der doktor,\" cried Mrs. Sieppe.\n\nMcTeague was presented, shaking hands gravely as Marcus shouldered him\nfrom one to the other.\n\nMr. Sieppe was a little man of a military aspect, full of importance,\ntaking himself very seriously. He was a member of a rifle team. Over his\nshoulder was slung a Springfield rifle, while his breast was decorated\nby five bronze medals.\n\nTrina was delighted. McTeague was dumfounded. She appeared positively\nglad to see him.\n\n\"How do you do, Doctor McTeague,\" she said, smiling at him and shaking\nhis hand. \"It's nice to see you again. Look, see how fine my filling\nis.\" She lifted a corner of her lip and showed him the clumsy gold\nbridge.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Sieppe toiled and perspired. Upon him devolved the\nresponsibility of the excursion. He seemed to consider it a matter of\nvast importance, a veritable expedition.\n\n\"Owgooste!\" he shouted to the little boy with the black greyhound, \"you\nwill der hound und basket number three carry. Der tervins,\" he added,\ncalling to the two smallest boys, who were dressed exactly alike, \"will\nreleef one unudder mit der camp-stuhl und basket number four. Dat\nis comprehend, hay? When we make der start, you childern will in der\nadvance march. Dat is your orders. But we do not start,\" he exclaimed,\nexcitedly; \"we remain. Ach Gott, Selina, who does not arrive.\"\n\nSelina, it appeared, was a niece of Mrs. Sieppe's. They were on the\npoint of starting without her, when she suddenly arrived, very much out\nof breath. She was a slender, unhealthy looking girl, who overworked\nherself giving lessons in hand-painting at twenty-five cents an hour.\nMcTeague was presented. They all began to talk at once, filling the\nlittle station-house with a confusion of tongues.\n\n\"Attention!\" cried Mr. Sieppe, his gold-headed cane in one hand, his\nSpringfield in the other. \"Attention! We depart.\" The four little boys\nmoved off ahead; the greyhound suddenly began to bark, and tug at his\nleash. The others picked up their bundles.\n\n\"Vorwarts!\" shouted Mr. Sieppe, waving his rifle and assuming the\nattitude of a lieutenant of infantry leading a charge. The party set off\ndown the railroad track.\n\nMrs. Sieppe walked with her husband, who constantly left her side\nto shout an order up and down the line. Marcus followed with Selina.\nMcTeague found himself with Trina at the end of the procession.\n\n\"We go off on these picnics almost every week,\" said Trina, by way of a\nbeginning, \"and almost every holiday, too. It is a custom.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, a custom,\" answered McTeague, nodding; \"a custom--that's the\nword.\"\n\n\"Don't you think picnics are fine fun, Doctor McTeague?\" she continued.\n\"You take your lunch; you leave the dirty city all day; you race about\nin the open air, and when lunchtime comes, oh, aren't you hungry? And\nthe woods and the grass smell so fine!\"\n\n\"I don' know, Miss Sieppe,\" he answered, keeping his eyes fixed on the\nground between the rails. \"I never went on a picnic.\"\n\n\"Never went on a picnic?\" she cried, astonished. \"Oh, you'll see what\nfun we'll have. In the morning father and the children dig clams in the\nmud by the shore, an' we bake them, and--oh, there's thousands of things\nto do.\"\n\n\"Once I went sailing on the bay,\" said McTeague. \"It was in a tugboat;\nwe fished off the heads. I caught three codfishes.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid to go out on the bay,\" answered Trina, shaking her head,\n\"sailboats tip over so easy. A cousin of mine, Selina's brother, was\ndrowned one Decoration Day. They never found his body. Can you swim,\nDoctor McTeague?\"\n\n\"I used to at the mine.\"\n\n\"At the mine? Oh, yes, I remember, Marcus told me you were a miner\nonce.\"\n\n\"I was a car-boy; all the car-boys used to swim in the reservoir by the\nditch every Thursday evening. One of them was bit by a rattlesnake once\nwhile he was dressing. He was a Frenchman, named Andrew. He swelled up\nand began to twitch.\"\n\n\"Oh, how I hate snakes! They're so crawly and graceful--but, just the\nsame, I like to watch them. You know that drug store over in town that\nhas a showcase full of live ones?\"\n\n\"We killed the rattler with a cart whip.\"\n\n\"How far do you think you could swim? Did you ever try? D'you think you\ncould swim a mile?\"\n\n\"A mile? I don't know. I never tried. I guess I could.\"\n\n\"I can swim a little. Sometimes we all go out to the Crystal Baths.\"\n\n\"The Crystal Baths, huh? Can you swim across the tank?\"\n\n\"Oh, I can swim all right as long as papa holds my chin up. Soon as\nhe takes his hand away, down I go. Don't you hate to get water in your\nears?\"\n\n\"Bathing's good for you.\"\n\n\"If the water's too warm, it isn't. It weakens you.\"\n\nMr. Sieppe came running down the tracks, waving his cane.\n\n\"To one side,\" he shouted, motioning them off the track; \"der drain\ngomes.\" A local passenger train was just passing B Street station, some\nquarter of a mile behind them. The party stood to one side to let it\npass. Marcus put a nickel and two crossed pins upon the rail, and waved\nhis hat to the passengers as the train roared past. The children shouted\nshrilly. When the train was gone, they all rushed to see the nickel and\nthe crossed pins. The nickel had been jolted off, but the pins had been\nflattened out so that they bore a faint resemblance to opened scissors.\nA great contention arose among the children for the possession of these\n\"scissors.\" Mr. Sieppe was obliged to intervene. He reflected gravely.\nIt was a matter of tremendous moment. The whole party halted, awaiting\nhis decision.\n\n\"Attend now,\" he suddenly exclaimed. \"It will not be soh soon. At der\nend of der day, ven we shall have home gecommen, den wull it pe adjudge,\neh? A REward of merit to him who der bes' pehaves. It is an order.\nVorwarts!\"\n\n\"That was a Sacramento train,\" said Marcus to Selina as they started\noff; \"it was, for a fact.\"\n\n\"I know a girl in Sacramento,\" Trina told McTeague. \"She's forewoman in\na glove store, and she's got consumption.\"\n\n\"I was in Sacramento once,\" observed McTeague, \"nearly eight years ago.\"\n\n\"Is it a nice place--as nice as San Francisco?\"\n\n\"It's hot. I practised there for a while.\"\n\n\"I like San Francisco,\" said Trina, looking across the bay to where the\ncity piled itself upon its hills.\n\n\"So do I,\" answered McTeague. \"Do you like it better than living over\nhere?\"\n\n\"Oh, sure, I wish we lived in the city. If you want to go across for\nanything it takes up the whole day.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, the whole day--almost.\"\n\n\"Do you know many people in the city? Do you know anybody named\nOelbermann? That's my uncle. He has a wholesale toy store in the\nMission. They say he's awful rich.\"\n\n\"No, I don' know him.\"\n\n\"His stepdaughter wants to be a nun. Just fancy! And Mr. Oelbermann\nwon't have it. He says it would be just like burying his child. Yes,\nshe wants to enter the convent of the Sacred Heart. Are you a Catholic,\nDoctor McTeague?\"\n\n\"No. No, I--\"\n\n\"Papa is a Catholic. He goes to Mass on the feast days once in a while.\nBut mamma's Lutheran.\"\n\n\"The Catholics are trying to get control of the schools,\" observed\nMcTeague, suddenly remembering one of Marcus's political tirades.\n\n\"That's what cousin Mark says. We are going to send the twins to the\nkindergarten next month.\"\n\n\"What's the kindergarten?\"\n\n\"Oh, they teach them to make things out of straw and toothpicks--kind of\na play place to keep them off the street.\"\n\n\"There's one up on Sacramento Street, not far from Polk Street. I saw\nthe sign.\"\n\n\"I know where. Why, Selina used to play the piano there.\"\n\n\"Does she play the piano?\"\n\n\"Oh, you ought to hear her. She plays fine. Selina's very accomplished.\nShe paints, too.\"\n\n\"I can play on the concertina.\"\n\n\"Oh, can you? I wish you'd brought it along. Next time you will. I hope\nyou'll come often on our picnics. You'll see what fun we'll have.\"\n\n\"Fine day for a picnic, ain't it? There ain't a cloud.\"\n\n\"That's so,\" exclaimed Trina, looking up, \"not a single cloud. Oh, yes;\nthere is one, just over Telegraph Hill.\"\n\n\"That's smoke.\"\n\n\"No, it's a cloud. Smoke isn't white that way.\"\n\n\"'Tis a cloud.\"\n\n\"I knew I was right. I never say a thing unless I'm pretty sure.\"\n\n\"It looks like a dog's head.\"\n\n\"Don't it? Isn't Marcus fond of dogs?\"\n\n\"He got a new dog last week--a setter.\"\n\n\"Did he?\"\n\n\"Yes. He and I took a lot of dogs from his hospital out for a walk\nto the Cliff House last Sunday, but we had to walk all the way home,\nbecause they wouldn't follow. You've been out to the Cliff House?\"\n\n\"Not for a long time. We had a picnic there one Fourth of July, but it\nrained. Don't you love the ocean?\"\n\n\"Yes--yes, I like it pretty well.\"\n\n\"Oh, I'd like to go off in one of those big sailing ships. Just away,\nand away, and away, anywhere. They're different from a little yacht. I'd\nlove to travel.\"\n\n\"Sure; so would I.\"\n\n\"Papa and mamma came over in a sailing ship. They were twenty-one days.\nMamma's uncle used to be a sailor. He was captain of a steamer on Lake\nGeneva, in Switzerland.\"\n\n\"Halt!\" shouted Mr. Sieppe, brandishing his rifle. They had arrived at\nthe gates of the park. All at once McTeague turned cold. He had only\na quarter in his pocket. What was he expected to do--pay for the whole\nparty, or for Trina and himself, or merely buy his own ticket? And even\nin this latter case would a quarter be enough? He lost his wits,\nrolling his eyes helplessly. Then it occurred to him to feign a great\nabstraction, pretending not to know that the time was come to pay. He\nlooked intently up and down the tracks; perhaps a train was coming.\n\"Here we are,\" cried Trina, as they came up to the rest of the party,\ncrowded about the entrance. \"Yes, yes,\" observed McTeague, his head in\nthe air.\n\n\"Gi' me four bits, Mac,\" said Marcus, coming up. \"Here's where we shell\nout.\"\n\n\"I--I--I only got a quarter,\" mumbled the dentist, miserably. He felt\nthat he had ruined himself forever with Trina. What was the use of\ntrying to win her? Destiny was against him. \"I only got a quarter,\" he\nstammered. He was on the point of adding that he would not go in the\npark. That seemed to be the only alternative.\n\n\"Oh, all right!\" said Marcus, easily. \"I'll pay for you, and you can\nsquare with me when we go home.\"\n\nThey filed into the park, Mr. Sieppe counting them off as they entered.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Trina, with a long breath, as she and McTeague pushed through\nthe wicket, \"here we are once more, Doctor.\" She had not appeared to\nnotice McTeague's embarrassment. The difficulty had been tided over\nsomehow. Once more McTeague felt himself saved.\n\n\"To der beach!\" shouted Mr. Sieppe. They had checked their baskets at\nthe peanut stand. The whole party trooped down to the seashore. The\ngreyhound was turned loose. The children raced on ahead.\n\nFrom one of the larger parcels Mrs. Sieppe had drawn forth a small tin\nsteamboat--August's birthday present--a gaudy little toy which could be\nsteamed up and navigated by means of an alcohol lamp. Her trial trip was\nto be made this morning.\n\n\"Gi' me it, gi' me it,\" shouted August, dancing around his father.\n\n\"Not soh, not soh,\" cried Mr. Sieppe, bearing it aloft. \"I must first\nder eggsperimunt make.\"\n\n\"No, no!\" wailed August. \"I want to play with ut.\"\n\n\"Obey!\" thundered Mr. Sieppe. August subsided. A little jetty ran part\nof the way into the water. Here, after a careful study of the directions\nprinted on the cover of the box, Mr. Sieppe began to fire the little\nboat.\n\n\"I want to put ut in the wa-ater,\" cried August.\n\n\"Stand back!\" shouted his parent. \"You do not know so well as me; dere\nis dandger. Mitout attention he will eggsplode.\"\n\n\"I want to play with ut,\" protested August, beginning to cry.\n\n\"Ach, soh; you cry, bube!\" vociferated Mr. Sieppe. \"Mommer,\" addressing\nMrs. Sieppe, \"he will soh soon be ge-whipt, eh?\"\n\n\"I want my boa-wut,\" screamed August, dancing.\n\n\"Silence!\" roared Mr. Sieppe. The little boat began to hiss and smoke.\n\n\"Soh,\" observed the father, \"he gommence. Attention! I put him in der\nwater.\" He was very excited. The perspiration dripped from the back of\nhis neck. The little boat was launched. It hissed more furiously than\never. Clouds of steam rolled from it, but it refused to move.\n\n\"You don't know how she wo-rks,\" sobbed August.\n\n\"I know more soh mudge as der grossest liddle fool as you,\" cried Mr.\nSieppe, fiercely, his face purple.\n\n\"You must give it sh--shove!\" exclaimed the boy.\n\n\"Den he eggsplode, idiot!\" shouted his father. All at once the boiler of\nthe steamer blew up with a sharp crack. The little tin toy turned over\nand sank out of sight before any one could interfere.\n\n\"Ah--h! Yah! Yah!\" yelled August. \"It's go-one!\"\n\nInstantly Mr. Sieppe boxed his ears. There was a lamentable scene.\nAugust rent the air with his outcries; his father shook him till his\nboots danced on the jetty, shouting into his face:\n\n\"Ach, idiot! Ach, imbecile! Ach, miserable! I tol' you he eggsplode.\nStop your cry. Stop! It is an order. Do you wish I drow you in der\nwater, eh? Speak. Silence, bube! Mommer, where ist mein stick? He will\nder grossest whippun ever of his life receive.\"\n\nLittle by little the boy subsided, swallowing his sobs, knuckling his\neyes, gazing ruefully at the spot where the boat had sunk. \"Dot is\nbetter soh,\" commented Mr. Sieppe, finally releasing him. \"Next dime\nberhaps you will your fat'er better pelief. Now, no more. We will\nder glams ge-dig, Mommer, a fire. Ach, himmel! we have der pfeffer\nforgotten.\"\n\nThe work of clam digging began at once, the little boys taking off their\nshoes and stockings. At first August refused to be comforted, and it was\nnot until his father drove him into the water with his gold-headed cane\nthat he consented to join the others.\n\nWhat a day that was for McTeague! What a never-to-be-forgotten day! He\nwas with Trina constantly. They laughed together--she demurely, her lips\nclosed tight, her little chin thrust out, her small pale nose, with its\nadorable little freckles, wrinkling; he roared with all the force of his\nlungs, his enormous mouth distended, striking sledge-hammer blows upon\nhis knee with his clenched fist.\n\nThe lunch was delicious. Trina and her mother made a clam chowder that\nmelted in one's mouth. The lunch baskets were emptied. The party were\nfully two hours eating. There were huge loaves of rye bread full of\ngrains of chickweed. There were weiner-wurst and frankfurter sausages.\nThere was unsalted butter. There were pretzels. There was cold underdone\nchicken, which one ate in slices, plastered with a wonderful kind of\nmustard that did not sting. There were dried apples, that gave Mr.\nSieppe the hiccoughs. There were a dozen bottles of beer, and, last of\nall, a crowning achievement, a marvellous Gotha truffle. After lunch\ncame tobacco. Stuffed to the eyes, McTeague drowsed over his pipe, prone\non his back in the sun, while Trina, Mrs. Sieppe, and Selina washed the\ndishes. In the afternoon Mr. Sieppe disappeared. They heard the reports\nof his rifle on the range. The others swarmed over the park, now around\nthe swings, now in the Casino, now in the museum, now invading the\nmerry-go-round.\n\nAt half-past five o'clock Mr. Sieppe marshalled the party together. It\nwas time to return home.\n\nThe family insisted that Marcus and McTeague should take supper with\nthem at their home and should stay over night. Mrs. Sieppe argued they\ncould get no decent supper if they went back to the city at that hour;\nthat they could catch an early morning boat and reach their business in\ngood time. The two friends accepted.\n\nThe Sieppes lived in a little box of a house at the foot of B Street,\nthe first house to the right as one went up from the station. It was two\nstories high, with a funny red mansard roof of oval slates. The interior\nwas cut up into innumerable tiny rooms, some of them so small as to be\nhardly better than sleeping closets. In the back yard was a contrivance\nfor pumping water from the cistern that interested McTeague at once.\nIt was a dog-wheel, a huge revolving box in which the unhappy black\ngreyhound spent most of his waking hours. It was his kennel; he slept\nin it. From time to time during the day Mrs. Sieppe appeared on the back\ndoorstep, crying shrilly, \"Hoop, hoop!\" She threw lumps of coal at him,\nwaking him to his work.\n\nThey were all very tired, and went to bed early. After great discussion\nit was decided that Marcus would sleep upon the lounge in the front\nparlor. Trina would sleep with August, giving up her room to McTeague.\nSelina went to her home, a block or so above the Sieppes's. At nine\no'clock Mr. Sieppe showed McTeague to his room and left him to himself\nwith a newly lighted candle.\n\nFor a long time after Mr. Sieppe had gone McTeague stood motionless in\nthe middle of the room, his elbows pressed close to his sides, looking\nobliquely from the corners of his eyes. He hardly dared to move. He was\nin Trina's room.\n\nIt was an ordinary little room. A clean white matting was on the floor;\ngray paper, spotted with pink and green flowers, covered the walls. In\none corner, under a white netting, was a little bed, the woodwork gayly\npainted with knots of bright flowers. Near it, against the wall, was a\nblack walnut bureau. A work-table with spiral legs stood by the window,\nwhich was hung with a green and gold window curtain. Opposite the window\nthe closet door stood ajar, while in the corner across from the bed was\na tiny washstand with two clean towels.\n\nAnd that was all. But it was Trina's room. McTeague was in his lady's\nbower; it seemed to him a little nest, intimate, discreet. He felt\nhideously out of place. He was an intruder; he, with his enormous feet,\nhis colossal bones, his crude, brutal gestures. The mere weight of his\nlimbs, he was sure, would crush the little bed-stead like an eggshell.\n\nThen, as this first sensation wore off, he began to feel the charm of\nthe little chamber. It was as though Trina were close by, but invisible.\nMcTeague felt all the delight of her presence without the embarrassment\nthat usually accompanied it. He was near to her--nearer than he had ever\nbeen before. He saw into her daily life, her little ways and manners,\nher habits, her very thoughts. And was there not in the air of that room\na certain faint perfume that he knew, that recalled her to his mind with\nmarvellous vividness?\n\nAs he put the candle down upon the bureau he saw her hairbrush lying\nthere. Instantly he picked it up, and, without knowing why, held it\nto his face. With what a delicious odor was it redolent! That heavy,\nenervating odor of her hair--her wonderful, royal hair! The smell of\nthat little hairbrush was talismanic. He had but to close his eyes to\nsee her as distinctly as in a mirror. He saw her tiny, round figure,\ndressed all in black--for, curiously enough, it was his very first\nimpression of Trina that came back to him now--not the Trina of the\nlater occasions, not the Trina of the blue cloth skirt and white sailor.\nHe saw her as he had seen her the day that Marcus had introduced them:\nsaw her pale, round face; her narrow, half-open eyes, blue like the\neyes of a baby; her tiny, pale ears, suggestive of anaemia; the freckles\nacross the bridge of her nose; her pale lips; the tiara of royal black\nhair; and, above all, the delicious poise of the head, tipped back as\nthough by the weight of all that hair--the poise that thrust out her\nchin a little, with the movement that was so confiding, so innocent, so\nnearly infantile.\n\nMcTeague went softly about the room from one object to another,\nbeholding Trina in everything he touched or looked at. He came at last\nto the closet door. It was ajar. He opened it wide, and paused upon the\nthreshold.\n\nTrina's clothes were hanging there--skirts and waists, jackets, and\nstiff white petticoats. What a vision! For an instant McTeague caught\nhis breath, spellbound. If he had suddenly discovered Trina herself\nthere, smiling at him, holding out her hands, he could hardly have been\nmore overcome. Instantly he recognized the black dress she had worn on\nthat famous first day. There it was, the little jacket she had\ncarried over her arm the day he had terrified her with his blundering\ndeclaration, and still others, and others--a whole group of Trinas\nfaced him there. He went farther into the closet, touching the clothes\ngingerly, stroking them softly with his huge leathern palms. As he\nstirred them a delicate perfume disengaged itself from the folds. Ah,\nthat exquisite feminine odor! It was not only her hair now, it was\nTrina herself--her mouth, her hands, her neck; the indescribably sweet,\nfleshly aroma that was a part of her, pure and clean, and redolent of\nyouth and freshness. All at once, seized with an unreasoned impulse,\nMcTeague opened his huge arms and gathered the little garments close to\nhim, plunging his face deep amongst them, savoring their delicious odor\nwith long breaths of luxury and supreme content.\n\n* * * * *\n\nThe picnic at Schuetzen Park decided matters. McTeague began to call\non Trina regularly Sunday and Wednesday afternoons. He took Marcus\nSchouler's place. Sometimes Marcus accompanied him, but it was generally\nto meet Selina by appointment at the Sieppes's house.\n\nBut Marcus made the most of his renunciation of his cousin. He\nremembered his pose from time to time. He made McTeague unhappy and\nbewildered by wringing his hand, by venting sighs that seemed to tear\nhis heart out, or by giving evidences of an infinite melancholy. \"What\nis my life!\" he would exclaim. \"What is left for me? Nothing, by damn!\"\nAnd when McTeague would attempt remonstrance, he would cry: \"Never mind,\nold man. Never mind me. Go, be happy. I forgive you.\"\n\nForgive what? McTeague was all at sea, was harassed with the thought of\nsome shadowy, irreparable injury he had done his friend.\n\n\"Oh, don't think of me!\" Marcus would exclaim at other times, even when\nTrina was by. \"Don't think of me; I don't count any more. I ain't in\nit.\" Marcus seemed to take great pleasure in contemplating the wreck of\nhis life. There is no doubt he enjoyed himself hugely during these days.\n\nThe Sieppes were at first puzzled as well over this change of front.\n\n\"Trina has den a new younge man,\" cried Mr. Sieppe. \"First Schouler, now\nder doktor, eh? What die tevil, I say!\"\n\nWeeks passed, February went, March came in very rainy, putting a stop to\nall their picnics and Sunday excursions.\n\nOne Wednesday afternoon in the second week in March McTeague came over\nto call on Trina, bringing his concertina with him, as was his custom\nnowadays. As he got off the train at the station he was surprised to\nfind Trina waiting for him.\n\n\"This is the first day it hasn't rained in weeks,\" she explained, \"an' I\nthought it would be nice to walk.\"\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" assented McTeague.\n\nB Street station was nothing more than a little shed. There was no\nticket office, nothing but a couple of whittled and carven benches. It\nwas built close to the railroad tracks, just across which was the dirty,\nmuddy shore of San Francisco Bay. About a quarter of a mile back from\nthe station was the edge of the town of Oakland. Between the station\nand the first houses of the town lay immense salt flats, here and there\nbroken by winding streams of black water. They were covered with a\ngrowth of wiry grass, strangely discolored in places by enormous stains\nof orange yellow.\n\nNear the station a bit of fence painted with a cigar advertisement\nreeled over into the mud, while under its lee lay an abandoned gravel\nwagon with dished wheels. The station was connected with the town by\nthe extension of B Street, which struck across the flats geometrically\nstraight, a file of tall poles with intervening wires marching along\nwith it. At the station these were headed by an iron electric-light pole\nthat, with its supports and outriggers, looked for all the world like an\nimmense grasshopper on its hind legs.\n\nAcross the flats, at the fringe of the town, were the dump heaps, the\nfigures of a few Chinese rag-pickers moving over them. Far to the left\nthe view was shut off by the immense red-brown drum of the gas-works;\nto the right it was bounded by the chimneys and workshops of an iron\nfoundry.\n\nAcross the railroad tracks, to seaward, one saw the long stretch of\nblack mud bank left bare by the tide, which was far out, nearly half a\nmile. Clouds of sea-gulls were forever rising and settling upon this mud\nbank; a wrecked and abandoned wharf crawled over it on tottering legs;\nclose in an old sailboat lay canted on her bilge.\n\nBut farther on, across the yellow waters of the bay, beyond Goat Island,\nlay San Francisco, a blue line of hills, rugged with roofs and spires.\nFar to the westward opened the Golden Gate, a bleak cutting in the\nsand-hills, through which one caught a glimpse of the open Pacific.\n\nThe station at B Street was solitary; no trains passed at this hour;\nexcept the distant rag-pickers, not a soul was in sight. The wind blew\nstrong, carrying with it the mingled smell of salt, of tar, of dead\nseaweed, and of bilge. The sky hung low and brown; at long intervals a\nfew drops of rain fell.\n\nNear the station Trina and McTeague sat on the roadbed of the tracks, at\nthe edge of the mud bank, making the most out of the landscape, enjoying\nthe open air, the salt marshes, and the sight of the distant water. From\ntime to time McTeague played his six mournful airs upon his concertina.\n\nAfter a while they began walking up and down the tracks, McTeague\ntalking about his profession, Trina listening, very interested and\nabsorbed, trying to understand.\n\n\"For pulling the roots of the upper molars we use the cowhorn forceps,\"\ncontinued the dentist, monotonously. \"We get the inside beak over the\npalatal roots and the cow-horn beak over the buccal roots--that's the\nroots on the outside, you see. Then we close the forceps, and that\nbreaks right through the alveolus--that's the part of the socket in the\njaw, you understand.\"\n\nAt another moment he told her of his one unsatisfied desire. \"Some day\nI'm going to have a big gilded tooth outside my window for a sign. Those\nbig gold teeth are beautiful, beautiful--only they cost so much, I can't\nafford one just now.\"\n\n\"Oh, it's raining,\" suddenly exclaimed Trina, holding out her palm.\nThey turned back and reached the station in a drizzle. The afternoon was\nclosing in dark and rainy. The tide was coming back, talking and lapping\nfor miles along the mud bank. Far off across the flats, at the edge of\nthe town, an electric car went by, stringing out a long row of diamond\nsparks on the overhead wires.\n\n\"Say, Miss Trina,\" said McTeague, after a while, \"what's the good of\nwaiting any longer? Why can't us two get married?\"\n\nTrina still shook her head, saying \"No\" instinctively, in spite of\nherself.\n\n\"Why not?\" persisted McTeague. \"Don't you like me well enough?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then why not?\"\n\n\"Because.\"\n\n\"Ah, come on,\" he said, but Trina still shook her head.\n\n\"Ah, come on,\" urged McTeague. He could think of nothing else to say,\nrepeating the same phrase over and over again to all her refusals.\n\n\"Ah, come on! Ah, come on!\"\n\nSuddenly he took her in his enormous arms, crushing down her struggle\nwith his immense strength. Then Trina gave up, all in an instant,\nturning her head to his. They kissed each other, grossly, full in the\nmouth.\n\nA roar and a jarring of the earth suddenly grew near and passed them\nin a reek of steam and hot air. It was the Overland, with its flaming\nheadlight, on its way across the continent.\n\nThe passage of the train startled them both. Trina struggled to free\nherself from McTeague. \"Oh, please! please!\" she pleaded, on the point\nof tears. McTeague released her, but in that moment a slight, a barely\nperceptible, revulsion of feeling had taken place in him. The instant\nthat Trina gave up, the instant she allowed him to kiss her, he thought\nless of her. She was not so desirable, after all. But this reaction\nwas so faint, so subtle, so intangible, that in another moment he\nhad doubted its occurrence. Yet afterward it returned. Was there not\nsomething gone from Trina now? Was he not disappointed in her for doing\nthat very thing for which he had longed? Was Trina the submissive, the\ncompliant, the attainable just the same, just as delicate and adorable\nas Trina the inaccessible? Perhaps he dimly saw that this must be so,\nthat it belonged to the changeless order of things--the man desiring\nthe woman only for what she withholds; the woman worshipping the man for\nthat which she yields up to him. With each concession gained the man's\ndesire cools; with every surrender made the woman's adoration increases.\nBut why should it be so?\n\nTrina wrenched herself free and drew back from McTeague, her little\nchin quivering; her face, even to the lobes of her pale ears, flushed\nscarlet; her narrow blue eyes brimming. Suddenly she put her head\nbetween her hands and began to sob.\n\n\"Say, say, Miss Trina, listen--listen here, Miss Trina,\" cried McTeague,\ncoming forward a step.\n\n\"Oh, don't!\" she gasped, shrinking. \"I must go home,\" she cried,\nspringing to her feet. \"It's late. I must. I must. Don't come with\nme, please. Oh, I'm so--so,\"--she could not find any words. \"Let me go\nalone,\" she went on. \"You may--you come Sunday. Good-by.\"\n\n\"Good-by,\" said McTeague, his head in a whirl at this sudden,\nunaccountable change. \"Can't I kiss you again?\" But Trina was firm now.\nWhen it came to his pleading--a mere matter of words--she was strong\nenough.\n\n\"No, no, you must not!\" she exclaimed, with energy. She was gone in\nanother instant. The dentist, stunned, bewildered, gazed stupidly after\nher as she ran up the extension of B Street through the rain.\n\nBut suddenly a great joy took possession of him. He had won her. Trina\nwas to be for him, after all. An enormous smile distended his thick\nlips; his eyes grew wide, and flashed; and he drew his breath quickly,\nstriking his mallet-like fist upon his knee, and exclaiming under his\nbreath:\n\n\"I got her, by God! I got her, by God!\" At the same time he thought\nbetter of himself; his self-respect increased enormously. The man that\ncould win Trina Sieppe was a man of extraordinary ability.\n\nTrina burst in upon her mother while the latter was setting a mousetrap\nin the kitchen.\n\n\"Oh, mamma!\"\n\n\"Eh? Trina? Ach, what has happun?\"\n\nTrina told her in a breath.\n\n\"Soh soon?\" was Mrs. Sieppe's first comment. \"Eh, well, what you cry\nfor, then?\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" wailed Trina, plucking at the end of her handkerchief.\n\n\"You loaf der younge doktor?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"Well, what for you kiss him?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"You don' know, you don' know? Where haf your sensus gone, Trina? You\nkiss der doktor. You cry, and you don' know. Is ut Marcus den?\"\n\n\"No, it's not Cousin Mark.\"\n\n\"Den ut must be der doktor.\"\n\nTrina made no answer.\n\n\"Eh?\"\n\n\"I--I guess so.\"\n\n\"You loaf him?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nMrs. Sieppe set down the mousetrap with such violence that it sprung\nwith a sharp snap.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 6\n\n\nNo, Trina did not know. \"Do I love him? Do I love him?\" A thousand times\nshe put the question to herself during the next two or three days. At\nnight she hardly slept, but lay broad awake for hours in her little,\ngayly painted bed, with its white netting, torturing herself with doubts\nand questions. At times she remembered the scene in the station with a\nveritable agony of shame, and at other times she was ashamed to recall\nit with a thrill of joy. Nothing could have been more sudden, more\nunexpected, than that surrender of herself. For over a year she had\nthought that Marcus would some day be her husband. They would be\nmarried, she supposed, some time in the future, she did not know exactly\nwhen; the matter did not take definite shape in her mind. She liked\nCousin Mark very well. And then suddenly this cross-current had set\nin; this blond giant had appeared, this huge, stolid fellow, with\nhis immense, crude strength. She had not loved him at first, that was\ncertain. The day he had spoken to her in his \"Parlors\" she had only been\nterrified. If he had confined himself to merely speaking, as did Marcus,\nto pleading with her, to wooing her at a distance, forestalling her\nwishes, showing her little attentions, sending her boxes of candy, she\ncould have easily withstood him. But he had only to take her in his\narms, to crush down her struggle with his enormous strength, to subdue\nher, conquer her by sheer brute force, and she gave up in an instant.\n\nBut why--why had she done so? Why did she feel the desire, the necessity\nof being conquered by a superior strength? Why did it please her? Why\nhad it suddenly thrilled her from head to foot with a quick, terrifying\ngust of passion, the like of which she had never known? Never at his\nbest had Marcus made her feel like that, and yet she had always thought\nshe cared for Cousin Mark more than for any one else.\n\nWhen McTeague had all at once caught her in his huge arms, something\nhad leaped to life in her--something that had hitherto lain dormant,\nsomething strong and overpowering. It frightened her now as she thought\nof it, this second self that had wakened within her, and that shouted\nand clamored for recognition. And yet, was it to be feared? Was it\nsomething to be ashamed of? Was it not, after all, natural, clean,\nspontaneous? Trina knew that she was a pure girl; knew that this sudden\ncommotion within her carried with it no suggestion of vice.\n\nDimly, as figures seen in a waking dream, these ideas floated through\nTrina's mind. It was quite beyond her to realize them clearly; she could\nnot know what they meant. Until that rainy day by the shore of the bay\nTrina had lived her life with as little self-consciousness as a tree.\nShe was frank, straightforward, a healthy, natural human being,\nwithout sex as yet. She was almost like a boy. At once there had been a\nmysterious disturbance. The woman within her suddenly awoke.\n\nDid she love McTeague? Difficult question. Did she choose him for better\nor for worse, deliberately, of her own free will, or was Trina herself\nallowed even a choice in the taking of that step that was to make or mar\nher life? The Woman is awakened, and, starting from her sleep, catches\nblindly at what first her newly opened eyes light upon. It is a spell, a\nwitchery, ruled by chance alone, inexplicable--a fairy queen enamored of\na clown with ass's ears.\n\nMcTeague had awakened the Woman, and, whether she would or no, she was\nhis now irrevocably; struggle against it as she would, she belonged to\nhim, body and soul, for life or for death. She had not sought it, she\nhad not desired it. The spell was laid upon her. Was it a blessing? Was\nit a curse? It was all one; she was his, indissolubly, for evil or for\ngood.\n\nAnd he? The very act of submission that bound the woman to him forever\nhad made her seem less desirable in his eyes. Their undoing had already\nbegun. Yet neither of them was to blame. From the first they had not\nsought each other. Chance had brought them face to face, and mysterious\ninstincts as ungovernable as the winds of heaven were at work knitting\ntheir lives together. Neither of them had asked that this thing should\nbe--that their destinies, their very souls, should be the sport of\nchance. If they could have known, they would have shunned the fearful\nrisk. But they were allowed no voice in the matter. Why should it all\nbe?\n\nIt had been on a Wednesday that the scene in the B Street station had\ntaken place. Throughout the rest of the week, at every hour of the day,\nTrina asked herself the same question: \"Do I love him? Do I really love\nhim? Is this what love is like?\" As she recalled McTeague--recalled his\nhuge, square-cut head, his salient jaw, his shock of yellow hair, his\nheavy, lumbering body, his slow wits--she found little to admire in him\nbeyond his physical strength, and at such moments she shook her head\ndecisively. \"No, surely she did not love him.\" Sunday afternoon,\nhowever, McTeague called. Trina had prepared a little speech for him.\nShe was to tell him that she did not know what had been the matter with\nher that Wednesday afternoon; that she had acted like a bad girl; that\nshe did not love him well enough to marry him; that she had told him as\nmuch once before.\n\nMcTeague saw her alone in the little front parlor. The instant she\nappeared he came straight towards her. She saw what he was bent upon\ndoing. \"Wait a minute,\" she cried, putting out her hands. \"Wait. You\ndon't understand. I have got something to say to you.\" She might as\nwell have talked to the wind. McTeague put aside her hands with a single\ngesture, and gripped her to him in a bearlike embrace that all but\nsmothered her. Trina was but a reed before that giant strength. McTeague\nturned her face to his and kissed her again upon the mouth. Where\nwas all Trina's resolve then? Where was her carefully prepared little\nspeech? Where was all her hesitation and torturing doubts of the last\nfew days? She clasped McTeague's huge red neck with both her slender\narms; she raised her adorable little chin and kissed him in return,\nexclaiming: \"Oh, I do love you! I do love you!\" Never afterward were the\ntwo so happy as at that moment.\n\nA little later in that same week, when Marcus and McTeague were\ntaking lunch at the car conductors' coffee-joint, the former suddenly\nexclaimed:\n\n\"Say, Mac, now that you've got Trina, you ought to do more for her. By\ndamn! you ought to, for a fact. Why don't you take her out somewhere--to\nthe theatre, or somewhere? You ain't on to your job.\"\n\nNaturally, McTeague had told Marcus of his success with Trina. Marcus\nhad taken on a grand air.\n\n\"You've got her, have you? Well, I'm glad of it, old man. I am, for a\nfact. I know you'll be happy with her. I know how I would have been. I\nforgive you; yes, I forgive you, freely.\"\n\nMcTeague had not thought of taking Trina to the theatre.\n\n\"You think I ought to, Mark?\" he inquired, hesitating. Marcus answered,\nwith his mouth full of suet pudding:\n\n\"Why, of course. That's the proper caper.\"\n\n\"Well--well, that's so. The theatre--that's the word.\"\n\n\"Take her to the variety show at the Orpheum. There's a good show there\nthis week; you'll have to take Mrs. Sieppe, too, of course,\" he added.\nMarcus was not sure of himself as regarded certain proprieties, nor, for\nthat matter, were any of the people of the little world of Polk Street.\nThe shop girls, the plumbers' apprentices, the small tradespeople, and\ntheir like, whose social position was not clearly defined, could never\nbe sure how far they could go and yet preserve their \"respectability.\"\nWhen they wished to be \"proper,\" they invariably overdid the thing.\nIt was not as if they belonged to the \"tough\" element, who had no\nappearances to keep up. Polk Street rubbed elbows with the \"avenue\"\none block above. There were certain limits which its dwellers could not\noverstep; but unfortunately for them, these limits were poorly defined.\nThey could never be sure of themselves. At an unguarded moment they\nmight be taken for \"toughs,\" so they generally erred in the other\ndirection, and were absurdly formal. No people have a keener eye for the\namenities than those whose social position is not assured.\n\n\"Oh, sure, you'll have to take her mother,\" insisted Marcus. \"It\nwouldn't be the proper racket if you didn't.\"\n\nMcTeague undertook the affair. It was an ordeal. Never in his life had\nhe been so perturbed, so horribly anxious. He called upon Trina the\nfollowing Wednesday and made arrangements. Mrs. Sieppe asked if little\nAugust might be included. It would console him for the loss of his\nsteamboat.\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" said McTeague. \"August too--everybody,\" he added, vaguely.\n\n\"We always have to leave so early,\" complained Trina, \"in order to catch\nthe last boat. Just when it's becoming interesting.\"\n\nAt this McTeague, acting upon a suggestion of Marcus Schouler's,\ninsisted they should stay at the flat over night. Marcus and the dentist\nwould give up their rooms to them and sleep at the dog hospital. There\nwas a bed there in the sick ward that old Grannis sometimes occupied\nwhen a bad case needed watching. All at once McTeague had an idea, a\nveritable inspiration.\n\n\"And we'll--we'll--we'll have--what's the matter with having something\nto eat afterward in my 'Parlors'?\"\n\n\"Vairy goot,\" commented Mrs. Sieppe. \"Bier, eh? And some damales.\"\n\n\"Oh, I love tamales!\" exclaimed Trina, clasping her hands.\n\nMcTeague returned to the city, rehearsing his instructions over and\nover. The theatre party began to assume tremendous proportions. First of\nall, he was to get the seats, the third or fourth row from the front, on\nthe left-hand side, so as to be out of the hearing of the drums in the\norchestra; he must make arrangements about the rooms with Marcus, must\nget in the beer, but not the tamales; must buy for himself a white lawn\ntie--so Marcus directed; must look to it that Maria Macapa put his room\nin perfect order; and, finally, must meet the Sieppes at the ferry slip\nat half-past seven the following Monday night.\n\nThe real labor of the affair began with the buying of the tickets. At\nthe theatre McTeague got into wrong entrances; was sent from one wicket\nto another; was bewildered, confused; misunderstood directions; was at\none moment suddenly convinced that he had not enough money with him,\nand started to return home. Finally he found himself at the box-office\nwicket.\n\n\"Is it here you buy your seats?\"\n\n\"How many?\"\n\n\"Is it here--\"\n\n\"What night do you want 'em? Yes, sir, here's the place.\"\n\nMcTeague gravely delivered himself of the formula he had been reciting\nfor the last dozen hours.\n\n\"I want four seats for Monday night in the fourth row from the front,\nand on the right-hand side.\"\n\n\"Right hand as you face the house or as you face the stage?\" McTeague\nwas dumfounded.\n\n\"I want to be on the right-hand side,\" he insisted, stolidly; adding,\n\"in order to be away from the drums.\"\n\n\"Well, the drums are on the right of the orchestra as you face the\nstage,\" shouted the other impatiently; \"you want to the left, then, as\nyou face the house.\"\n\n\"I want to be on the right-hand side,\" persisted the dentist.\n\nWithout a word the seller threw out four tickets with a magnificent,\nsupercilious gesture.\n\n\"There's four seats on the right-hand side, then, and you're right up\nagainst the drums.\"\n\n\"But I don't want to be near the drums,\" protested McTeague, beginning\nto perspire.\n\n\"Do you know what you want at all?\" said the ticket seller with\ncalmness, thrusting his head at McTeague. The dentist knew that he had\nhurt this young man's feelings.\n\n\"I want--I want,\" he stammered. The seller slammed down a plan of the\nhouse in front of him and began to explain excitedly. It was the one\nthing lacking to complete McTeague's confusion.\n\n\"There are your seats,\" finished the seller, shoving the tickets into\nMcTeague's hands. \"They are the fourth row from the front, and away from\nthe drums. Now are you satisfied?\"\n\n\"Are they on the right-hand side? I want on the right--no, I want on the\nleft. I want--I don' know, I don' know.\"\n\nThe seller roared. McTeague moved slowly away, gazing stupidly at the\nblue slips of pasteboard. Two girls took his place at the wicket. In\nanother moment McTeague came back, peering over the girls' shoulders and\ncalling to the seller:\n\n\"Are these for Monday night?\"\n\nThe other disdained reply. McTeague retreated again timidly, thrusting\nthe tickets into his immense wallet. For a moment he stood thoughtful\non the steps of the entrance. Then all at once he became enraged, he\ndid not know exactly why; somehow he felt himself slighted. Once more he\ncame back to the wicket.\n\n\"You can't make small of me,\" he shouted over the girls' shoulders;\n\"you--you can't make small of me. I'll thump you in the head, you\nlittle--you little--you little--little--little pup.\" The ticket seller\nshrugged his shoulders wearily. \"A dollar and a half,\" he said to the\ntwo girls.\n\nMcTeague glared at him and breathed loudly. Finally he decided to let\nthe matter drop. He moved away, but on the steps was once more seized\nwith a sense of injury and outraged dignity.\n\n\"You can't make small of me,\" he called back a last time, wagging his\nhead and shaking his fist. \"I will--I will--I will--yes, I will.\" He\nwent off muttering.\n\nAt last Monday night came. McTeague met the Sieppes at the ferry,\ndressed in a black Prince Albert coat and his best slate-blue trousers,\nand wearing the made-up lawn necktie that Marcus had selected for him.\nTrina was very pretty in the black dress that McTeague knew so well.\nShe wore a pair of new gloves. Mrs. Sieppe had on lisle-thread mits, and\ncarried two bananas and an orange in a net reticule. \"For Owgooste,\" she\nconfided to him. Owgooste was in a Fauntleroy \"costume\" very much too\nsmall for him. Already he had been crying.\n\n\"Woult you pelief, Doktor, dot bube has torn his stockun alreatty? Walk\nin der front, you; stop cryun. Where is dot berliceman?\"\n\nAt the door of the theatre McTeague was suddenly seized with a panic\nterror. He had lost the tickets. He tore through his pockets, ransacked\nhis wallet. They were nowhere to be found. All at once he remembered,\nand with a gasp of relief removed his hat and took them out from beneath\nthe sweatband.\n\nThe party entered and took their places. It was absurdly early. The\nlights were all darkened, the ushers stood under the galleries in\ngroups, the empty auditorium echoing with their noisy talk. Occasionally\na waiter with his tray and clean white apron sauntered up and doun\nthe aisle. Directly in front of them was the great iron curtain of the\nstage, painted with all manner of advertisements. From behind this came\na noise of hammering and of occasional loud voices.\n\nWhile waiting they studied their programmes. First was an overture by\nthe orchestra, after which came \"The Gleasons, in their mirth-moving\nmusical farce, entitled 'McMonnigal's Court-ship.'\" This was to be\nfollowed by \"The Lamont Sisters, Winnie and Violet, serio-comiques and\nskirt dancers.\" And after this came a great array of other \"artists\" and\n\"specialty performers,\" musical wonders, acrobats, lightning artists,\nventriloquists, and last of all, \"The feature of the evening, the\ncrowning scientific achievement of the nineteenth century, the\nkinetoscope.\" McTeague was excited, dazzled. In five years he had not\nbeen twice to the theatre. Now he beheld himself inviting his \"girl\" and\nher mother to accompany him. He began to feel that he was a man of the\nworld. He ordered a cigar.\n\nMeanwhile the house was filling up. A few side brackets were turned on.\nThe ushers ran up and down the aisles, stubs of tickets between their\nthumb and finger, and from every part of the auditorium could be heard\nthe sharp clap-clapping of the seats as the ushers flipped them down. A\nbuzz of talk arose. In the gallery a street gamin whistled shrilly, and\ncalled to some friends on the other side of the house.\n\n\"Are they go-wun to begin pretty soon, ma?\" whined Owgooste for the\nfifth or sixth time; adding, \"Say, ma, can't I have some candy?\" A\ncadaverous little boy had appeared in their aisle, chanting, \"Candies,\nFrench mixed candies, popcorn, peanuts and candy.\" The orchestra\nentered, each man crawling out from an opening under the stage, hardly\nlarger than the gate of a rabbit hutch. At every instant now the crowd\nincreased; there were but few seats that were not taken. The waiters\nhurried up and down the aisles, their trays laden with beer glasses.\nA smell of cigar-smoke filled the air, and soon a faint blue haze rose\nfrom all corners of the house.\n\n\"Ma, when are they go-wun to begin?\" cried Owgooste. As he spoke\nthe iron advertisement curtain rose, disclosing the curtain proper\nunderneath. This latter curtain was quite an affair. Upon it was painted\na wonderful picture. A flight of marble steps led down to a stream of\nwater; two white swans, their necks arched like the capital letter S,\nfloated about. At the head of the marble steps were two vases filled\nwith red and yellow flowers, while at the foot was moored a gondola.\nThis gondola was full of red velvet rugs that hung over the side\nand trailed in the water. In the prow of the gondola a young man in\nvermilion tights held a mandolin in his left hand, and gave his right to\na girl in white satin. A King Charles spaniel, dragging a leading-string\nin the shape of a huge pink sash, followed the girl. Seven scarlet\nroses were scattered upon the two lowest steps, and eight floated in the\nwater.\n\n\"Ain't that pretty, Mac?\" exclaimed Trina, turning to the dentist.\n\n\"Ma, ain't they go-wun to begin now-wow?\" whined Owgooste. Suddenly the\nlights all over the house blazed up. \"Ah!\" said everybody all at once.\n\n\"Ain't ut crowdut?\" murmured Mr. Sieppe. Every seat was taken; many were\neven standing up.\n\n\"I always like it better when there is a crowd,\" said Trina. She was in\ngreat spirits that evening. Her round, pale face was positively pink.\n\nThe orchestra banged away at the overture, suddenly finishing with a\ngreat flourish of violins. A short pause followed. Then the orchestra\nplayed a quick-step strain, and the curtain rose on an interior\nfurnished with two red chairs and a green sofa. A girl in a short blue\ndress and black stockings entered in a hurry and began to dust the\ntwo chairs. She was in a great temper, talking very fast, disclaiming\nagainst the \"new lodger.\" It appeared that this latter never paid\nhis rent; that he was given to late hours. Then she came down to the\nfootlights and began to sing in a tremendous voice, hoarse and flat,\nalmost like a man's. The chorus, of a feeble originality, ran:\n\n     \"Oh, how happy I will be,\n     When my darling's face I'll see;\n     Oh, tell him for to meet me in the moonlight,\n     Down where the golden lilies bloom.\"\n\nThe orchestra played the tune of this chorus a second time, with certain\nvariations, while the girl danced to it. She sidled to one side of the\nstage and kicked, then sidled to the other and kicked again. As she\nfinished with the song, a man, evidently the lodger in question, came\nin. Instantly McTeague exploded in a roar of laughter. The man\nwas intoxicated, his hat was knocked in, one end of his collar was\nunfastened and stuck up into his face, his watch-chain dangled from\nhis pocket, and a yellow satin slipper was tied to a button-hole of his\nvest; his nose was vermilion, one eye was black and blue. After a short\ndialogue with the girl, a third actor appeared. He was dressed like a\nlittle boy, the girl's younger brother. He wore an immense turned-down\ncollar, and was continually doing hand-springs and wonderful back\nsomersaults. The \"act\" devolved upon these three people; the lodger\nmaking love to the girl in the short blue dress, the boy playing all\nmanner of tricks upon him, giving him tremendous digs in the ribs or\nslaps upon the back that made him cough, pulling chairs from under him,\nrunning on all fours between his legs and upsetting him, knocking him\nover at inopportune moments. Every one of his falls was accentuated by a\nbang upon the bass drum. The whole humor of the \"act\" seemed to consist\nin the tripping up of the intoxicated lodger.\n\nThis horse-play delighted McTeague beyond measure. He roared and shouted\nevery time the lodger went down, slapping his knee, wagging his head.\nOwgooste crowed shrilly, clapping his hands and continually\nasking, \"What did he say, ma? What did he say?\" Mrs. Sieppe laughed\nimmoderately, her huge fat body shaking like a mountain of jelly. She\nexclaimed from time to time, \"Ach, Gott, dot fool!\" Even Trina was\nmoved, laughing demurely, her lips closed, putting one hand with its new\nglove to her mouth.\n\nThe performance went on. Now it was the \"musical marvels,\" two men\nextravagantly made up as negro minstrels, with immense shoes and\nplaid vests. They seemed to be able to wrestle a tune out of almost\nanything--glass bottles, cigar-box fiddles, strings of sleigh-bells,\neven graduated brass tubes, which they rubbed with resined fingers.\nMcTeague was stupefied with admiration.\n\n\"That's what you call musicians,\" he announced gravely. \"'Home, Sweet\nHome,' played upon a trombone. Think of that! Art could go no farther.\"\n\nThe acrobats left him breathless. They were dazzling young men with\nbeautifully parted hair, continually making graceful gestures to the\naudience. In one of them the dentist fancied he saw a strong resemblance\nto the boy who had tormented the intoxicated lodger and who had turned\nsuch marvellous somersaults. Trina could not bear to watch their antics.\nShe turned away her head with a little shudder. \"It always makes me\nsick,\" she explained.\n\nThe beautiful young lady, \"The Society Contralto,\" in evening dress, who\nsang the sentimental songs, and carried the sheets of music at which she\nnever looked, pleased McTeague less. Trina, however, was captivated. She\ngrew pensive over\n\n     \"You do not love me--no;\n     Bid me good-by and go;\"\n\nand split her new gloves in her enthusiasm when it was finished.\n\n\"Don't you love sad music, Mac?\" she murmured.\n\nThen came the two comedians. They talked with fearful rapidity; their\nwit and repartee seemed inexhaustible.\n\n\"As I was going down the street yesterday--\"\n\n\"Ah! as YOU were going down the street--all right.\"\n\n\"I saw a girl at a window----\"\n\n\"YOU saw a girl at a window.\"\n\n\"And this girl she was a corker----\"\n\n\"Ah! as YOU were going down the street yesterday YOU saw a girl at a\nwindow, and this girl she was a corker. All right, go on.\"\n\nThe other comedian went on. The joke was suddenly evolved. A certain\nphrase led to a song, which was sung with lightning rapidity, each\nperformer making precisely the same gestures at precisely the same\ninstant. They were irresistible. McTeague, though he caught but a third\nof the jokes, could have listened all night.\n\nAfter the comedians had gone out, the iron advertisement curtain was let\ndown.\n\n\"What comes now?\" said McTeague, bewildered.\n\n\"It's the intermission of fifteen minutes now.\"\n\nThe musicians disappeared through the rabbit hutch, and the audience\nstirred and stretched itself. Most of the young men left their seats.\n\nDuring this intermission McTeague and his party had \"refreshments.\" Mrs.\nSieppe and Trina had Queen Charlottes, McTeague drank a glass of beer,\nOwgooste ate the orange and one of the bananas. He begged for a glass of\nlemonade, which was finally given him.\n\n\"Joost to geep um quiet,\" observed Mrs. Sieppe.\n\nBut almost immediately after drinking his lemonade Owgooste was seized\nwith a sudden restlessness. He twisted and wriggled in his seat,\nswinging his legs violently, looking about him with eyes full of a vague\ndistress. At length, just as the musicians were returning, he stood\nup and whispered energetically in his mother's ear. Mrs. Sieppe was\nexasperated at once.\n\n\"No, no,\" she cried, reseating him brusquely.\n\nThe performance was resumed. A lightning artist appeared, drawing\ncaricatures and portraits with incredible swiftness. He even went so far\nas to ask for subjects from the audience, and the names of prominent\nmen were shouted to him from the gallery. He drew portraits of the\nPresident, of Grant, of Washington, of Napoleon Bonaparte, of Bismarck,\nof Garibaldi, of P. T. Barnum.\n\nAnd so the evening passed. The hall grew very hot, and the smoke of\ninnumerable cigars made the eyes smart. A thick blue mist hung low over\nthe heads of the audience. The air was full of varied smells--the\nsmell of stale cigars, of flat beer, of orange peel, of gas, of sachet\npowders, and of cheap perfumery.\n\nOne \"artist\" after another came upon the stage. McTeague's attention\nnever wandered for a minute. Trina and her mother enjoyed themselves\nhugely. At every moment they made comments to one another, their eyes\nnever leaving the stage.\n\n\"Ain't dot fool joost too funny?\"\n\n\"That's a pretty song. Don't you like that kind of a song?\"\n\n\"Wonderful! It's wonderful! Yes, yes, wonderful! That's the word.\"\n\nOwgooste, however, lost interest. He stood up in his place, his back to\nthe stage, chewing a piece of orange peel and watching a little girl in\nher father's lap across the aisle, his eyes fixed in a glassy, ox-like\nstare. But he was uneasy. He danced from one foot to the other, and at\nintervals appealed in hoarse whispers to his mother, who disdained an\nanswer.\n\n\"Ma, say, ma-ah,\" he whined, abstractedly chewing his orange peel,\nstaring at the little girl.\n\n\"Ma-ah, say, ma.\" At times his monotonous plaint reached his mother's\nconsciousness. She suddenly realized what this was that was annoying\nher.\n\n\"Owgooste, will you sit down?\" She caught him up all at once, and jammed\nhim down into his place. \"Be quiet, den; loog; listun at der yunge\ngirls.\"\n\nThree young women and a young man who played a zither occupied the\nstage. They were dressed in Tyrolese costume; they were yodlers, and\nsang in German about \"mountain tops\" and \"bold hunters\" and the like.\nThe yodling chorus was a marvel of flute-like modulations. The girls\nwere really pretty, and were not made up in the least. Their \"turn\" had\na great success. Mrs. Sieppe was entranced. Instantly she remembered her\ngirlhood and her native Swiss village.\n\n\"Ach, dot is heavunly; joost like der old country. Mein gran'mutter used\nto be one of der mos' famous yodlers. When I was leedle, I haf seen dem\njoost like dat.\"\n\n\"Ma-ah,\" began Owgooste fretfully, as soon as the yodlers had departed.\nHe could not keep still an instant; he twisted from side to side,\nswinging his legs with incredible swiftness.\n\n\"Ma-ah, I want to go ho-ome.\"\n\n\"Pehave!\" exclaimed his mother, shaking him by the arm; \"loog, der\nleedle girl is watchun you. Dis is der last dime I take you to der blay,\nyou see.\"\n\n\"I don't ca-are; I'm sleepy.\" At length, to their great relief, he went\nto sleep, his head against his mother's arm.\n\nThe kinetoscope fairly took their breaths away.\n\n\"What will they do next?\" observed Trina, in amazement. \"Ain't that\nwonderful, Mac?\"\n\nMcTeague was awe-struck.\n\n\"Look at that horse move his head,\" he cried excitedly, quite carried\naway. \"Look at that cable car coming--and the man going across the\nstreet. See, here comes a truck. Well, I never in all my life! What\nwould Marcus say to this?\"\n\n\"It's all a drick!\" exclaimed Mrs. Sieppe, with sudden conviction. \"I\nain't no fool; dot's nothun but a drick.\"\n\n\"Well, of course, mamma,\" exclaimed Trina, \"it's----\"\n\nBut Mrs. Sieppe put her head in the air.\n\n\"I'm too old to be fooled,\" she persisted. \"It's a drick.\" Nothing more\ncould be got out of her than this.\n\nThe party stayed to the very end of the show, though the kinetoscope was\nthe last number but one on the programme, and fully half the audience\nleft immediately afterward. However, while the unfortunate Irish\ncomedian went through his \"act\" to the backs of the departing people,\nMrs. Sieppe woke Owgooste, very cross and sleepy, and began getting\nher \"things together.\" As soon as he was awake Owgooste began fidgeting\nagain.\n\n\"Save der brogramme, Trina,\" whispered Mrs. Sieppe. \"Take ut home to\npopper. Where is der hat of Owgooste? Haf you got mein handkerchief,\nTrina?\"\n\nBut at this moment a dreadful accident happened to Owgooste; his\ndistress reached its climax; his fortitude collapsed. What a misery!\nIt was a veritable catastrophe, deplorable, lamentable, a thing beyond\nwords! For a moment he gazed wildly about him, helpless and petrified\nwith astonishment and terror. Then his grief found utterance, and the\nclosing strains of the orchestra were mingled with a prolonged wail of\ninfinite sadness.\n\n\"Owgooste, what is ut?\" cried his mother eyeing him with dawning\nsuspicion; then suddenly, \"What haf you done? You haf ruin your new\nVauntleroy gostume!\" Her face blazed; without more ado she smacked him\nsoundly. Then it was that Owgooste touched the limit of his misery,\nhis unhappiness, his horrible discomfort; his utter wretchedness was\ncomplete. He filled the air with his doleful outcries. The more he was\nsmacked and shaken, the louder he wept.\n\n\"What--what is the matter?\" inquired McTeague.\n\nTrina's face was scarlet. \"Nothing, nothing,\" she exclaimed hastily,\nlooking away. \"Come, we must be going. It's about over.\" The end of the\nshow and the breaking up of the audience tided over the embarrassment of\nthe moment.\n\nThe party filed out at the tail end of the audience. Already the lights\nwere being extinguished and the ushers spreading druggeting over the\nupholstered seats.\n\nMcTeague and the Sieppes took an uptown car that would bring them near\nPolk Street. The car was crowded; McTeague and Owgooste were obliged to\nstand. The little boy fretted to be taken in his mother's lap, but Mrs.\nSieppe emphatically refused.\n\nOn their way home they discussed the performance.\n\n\"I--I like best der yodlers.\"\n\n\"Ah, the soloist was the best--the lady who sang those sad songs.\"\n\n\"Wasn't--wasn't that magic lantern wonderful, where the figures moved?\nWonderful--ah, wonderful! And wasn't that first act funny, where the\nfellow fell down all the time? And that musical act, and the fellow with\nthe burnt-cork face who played 'Nearer, My God, to Thee' on the beer\nbottles.\"\n\nThey got off at Polk Street and walked up a block to the flat. The\nstreet was dark and empty; opposite the flat, in the back of the\ndeserted market, the ducks and geese were calling persistently.\n\nAs they were buying their tamales from the half-breed Mexican at the\nstreet corner, McTeague observed:\n\n\"Marcus ain't gone to bed yet. See, there's a light in his window.\nThere!\" he exclaimed at once, \"I forgot the doorkey. Well, Marcus can\nlet us in.\"\n\nHardly had he rung the bell at the street door of the flat when the\nbolt was shot back. In the hall at the top of the long, narrow staircase\nthere was the sound of a great scurrying. Maria Macapa stood there,\nher hand upon the rope that drew the bolt; Marcus was at her side;\nOld Grannis was in the background, looking over their shoulders; while\nlittle Miss Baker leant over the banisters, a strange man in a drab\novercoat at her side. As McTeague's party stepped into the doorway a\nhalf-dozen voices cried:\n\n\"Yes, it's them.\"\n\n\"Is that you, Mac?\"\n\n\"Is that you, Miss Sieppe?\"\n\n\"Is your name Trina Sieppe?\"\n\nThen, shriller than all the rest, Maria Macapa screamed:\n\n\"Oh, Miss Sieppe, come up here quick. Your lottery ticket has won five\nthousand dollars!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\n\n\"What nonsense!\" answered Trina.\n\n\"Ach Gott! What is ut?\" cried Mrs. Sieppe, misunderstanding, supposing a\ncalamity.\n\n\"What--what--what,\" stammered the dentist, confused by the lights, the\ncrowded stairway, the medley of voices. The party reached the landing.\nThe others surrounded them. Marcus alone seemed to rise to the occasion.\n\n\"Le' me be the first to congratulate you,\" he cried, catching Trina's\nhand. Every one was talking at once.\n\n\"Miss Sieppe, Miss Sieppe, your ticket has won five thousand dollars,\"\ncried Maria. \"Don't you remember the lottery ticket I sold you in Doctor\nMcTeague's office?\"\n\n\"Trina!\" almost screamed her mother. \"Five tausend thalers! five tausend\nthalers! If popper were only here!\"\n\n\"What is it--what is it?\" exclaimed McTeague, rolling his eyes.\n\n\"What are you going to do with it, Trina?\" inquired Marcus.\n\n\"You're a rich woman, my dear,\" said Miss Baker, her little false curls\nquivering with excitement, \"and I'm glad for your sake. Let me kiss you.\nTo think I was in the room when you bought the ticket!\"\n\n\"Oh, oh!\" interrupted Trina, shaking her head, \"there is a mistake.\nThere must be. Why--why should I win five thousand dollars? It's\nnonsense!\"\n\n\"No mistake, no mistake,\" screamed Maria. \"Your number was 400,012. Here\nit is in the paper this evening. I remember it well, because I keep an\naccount.\"\n\n\"But I know you're wrong,\" answered Trina, beginning to tremble in spite\nof herself. \"Why should I win?\"\n\n\"Eh? Why shouldn't you?\" cried her mother.\n\nIn fact, why shouldn't she? The idea suddenly occurred to Trina. After\nall, it was not a question of effort or merit on her part. Why should\nshe suppose a mistake? What if it were true, this wonderful fillip of\nfortune striking in there like some chance-driven bolt?\n\n\"Oh, do you think so?\" she gasped.\n\nThe stranger in the drab overcoat came forward.\n\n\"It's the agent,\" cried two or three voices, simultaneously.\n\n\"I guess you're one of the lucky ones, Miss Sieppe,\" he said. \"I suppose\nyou have kept your ticket.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes; four three oughts twelve--I remember.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" admitted the other. \"Present your ticket at the local\nbranch office as soon as possible--the address is printed on the back\nof the ticket--and you'll receive a check on our bank for five thousand\ndollars. Your number will have to be verified on our official list, but\nthere's hardly a chance of a mistake. I congratulate you.\"\n\nAll at once a great shrill of gladness surged up in Trina. She was to\npossess five thousand dollars. She was carried away with the joy of her\ngood fortune, a natural, spontaneous joy--the gaiety of a child with a\nnew and wonderful toy.\n\n\"Oh, I've won, I've won, I've won!\" she cried, clapping her hands.\n\"Mamma, think of it. I've won five thousand dollars, just by buying a\nticket. Mac, what do you say to that? I've got five thousand dollars.\nAugust, do you hear what's happened to sister?\"\n\n\"Kiss your mommer, Trina,\" suddenly commanded Mrs. Sieppe. \"What efer\nwill you do mit all dose money, eh, Trina?\"\n\n\"Huh!\" exclaimed Marcus. \"Get married on it for one thing.\" Thereat\nthey all shouted with laughter. McTeague grinned, and looked about\nsheepishly. \"Talk about luck,\" muttered Marcus, shaking his head at the\ndentist; then suddenly he added:\n\n\"Well, are we going to stay talking out here in the hall all night?\nCan't we all come into your 'Parlors', Mac?\"\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" exclaimed McTeague, hastily unlocking his door.\n\n\"Efery botty gome,\" cried Mrs. Sieppe, genially. \"Ain't ut so, Doktor?\"\n\n\"Everybody,\" repeated the dentist. \"There's--there's some beer.\"\n\n\"We'll celebrate, by damn!\" exclaimed Marcus. \"It ain't every day you\nwin five thousand dollars. It's only Sundays and legal holidays.\" Again\nhe set the company off into a gale of laughter. Anything was funny at a\ntime like this. In some way every one of them felt elated. The wheel of\nfortune had come spinning close to them. They were near to this great\nsum of money. It was as though they too had won.\n\n\"Here's right where I sat when I bought that ticket,\" cried Trina, after\nthey had come into the \"Parlors,\" and Marcus had lit the gas. \"Right\nhere in this chair.\" She sat down in one of the rigid chairs under the\nsteel engraving. \"And, Marcus, you sat here----\"\n\n\"And I was just getting out of the operating chair,\" interposed Miss\nBaker.\n\n\"Yes, yes. That's so; and you,\" continued Trina, pointing to Maria,\n\"came up and said, 'Buy a ticket in the lottery; just a dollar.' Oh, I\nremember it just as plain as though it was yesterday, and I wasn't going\nto at first----\"\n\n\"And don't you know I told Maria it was against the law?\"\n\n\"Yes, I remember, and then I gave her a dollar and put the ticket in my\npocketbook. It's in my pocketbook now at home in the top drawer of my\nbureau--oh, suppose it should be stolen now,\" she suddenly exclaimed.\n\n\"It's worth big money now,\" asserted Marcus.\n\n\"Five thousand dollars. Who would have thought it? It's wonderful.\"\nEverybody started and turned. It was McTeague. He stood in the middle of\nthe floor, wagging his huge head. He seemed to have just realized what\nhad happened.\n\n\"Yes, sir, five thousand dollars!\" exclaimed Marcus, with a sudden\nunaccountable mirthlessness. \"Five thousand dollars! Do you get on to\nthat? Cousin Trina and you will be rich people.\"\n\n\"At six per cent, that's twenty-five dollars a month,\" hazarded the\nagent.\n\n\"Think of it. Think of it,\" muttered McTeague. He went aimlessly about\nthe room, his eyes wide, his enormous hands dangling.\n\n\"A cousin of mine won forty dollars once,\" observed Miss Baker. \"But he\nspent every cent of it buying more tickets, and never won anything.\"\n\nThen the reminiscences began. Maria told about the butcher on the next\nblock who had won twenty dollars the last drawing. Mrs. Sieppe knew a\ngasfitter in Oakland who had won several times; once a hundred dollars.\nLittle Miss Baker announced that she had always believed that lotteries\nwere wrong; but, just the same, five thousand was five thousand.\n\n\"It's all right when you win, ain't it, Miss Baker?\" observed Marcus,\nwith a certain sarcasm. What was the matter with Marcus? At moments he\nseemed singularly out of temper.\n\nBut the agent was full of stories. He told his experiences, the legends\nand myths that had grown up around the history of the lottery; he told\nof the poor newsboy with a dying mother to support who had drawn a prize\nof fifteen thousand; of the man who was driven to suicide through want,\nbut who held (had he but known it) the number that two days after his\ndeath drew the capital prize of thirty thousand dollars; of the little\nmilliner who for ten years had played the lottery without success, and\nwho had one day declared that she would buy but one more ticket and then\ngive up trying, and of how this last ticket had brought her a fortune\nupon which she could retire; of tickets that had been lost or destroyed,\nand whose numbers had won fabulous sums at the drawing; of criminals,\ndriven to vice by poverty, and who had reformed after winning\ncompetencies; of gamblers who played the lottery as they would play\na faro bank, turning in their winnings again as soon as made, buying\nthousands of tickets all over the country; of superstitions as to\nterminal and initial numbers, and as to lucky days of purchase; of\nmarvellous coincidences--three capital prizes drawn consecutively by the\nsame town; a ticket bought by a millionaire and given to his boot-black,\nwho won a thousand dollars upon it; the same number winning the same\namount an indefinite number of times; and so on to infinity. Invariably\nit was the needy who won, the destitute and starving woke to wealth and\nplenty, the virtuous toiler suddenly found his reward in a ticket bought\nat a hazard; the lottery was a great charity, the friend of the people,\na vast beneficent machine that recognized neither rank nor wealth nor\nstation.\n\nThe company began to be very gay. Chairs and tables were brought in from\nthe adjoining rooms, and Maria was sent out for more beer and tamales,\nand also commissioned to buy a bottle of wine and some cake for Miss\nBaker, who abhorred beer.\n\nThe \"Dental Parlors\" were in great confusion. Empty beer bottles stood\non the movable rack where the instruments were kept; plates and napkins\nwere upon the seat of the operating chair and upon the stand of shelves\nin the corner, side by side with the concertina and the volumes of\n\"Allen's Practical Dentist.\" The canary woke and chittered crossly, his\nfeathers puffed out; the husks of tamales littered the floor; the stone\npug dog sitting before the little stove stared at the unusual scene, his\nglass eyes starting from their sockets.\n\nThey drank and feasted in impromptu fashion. Marcus Schouler assumed\nthe office of master of ceremonies; he was in a lather of excitement,\nrushing about here and there, opening beer bottles, serving the tamales,\nslapping McTeague upon the back, laughing and joking continually. He\nmade McTeague sit at the head of the table, with Trina at his right and\nthe agent at his left; he--when he sat down at all--occupied the foot,\nMaria Macapa at his left, while next to her was Mrs. Sieppe, opposite\nMiss Baker. Owgooste had been put to bed upon the bed-lounge.\n\n\"Where's Old Grannis?\" suddenly exclaimed Marcus. Sure enough, where had\nthe old Englishman gone? He had been there at first.\n\n\"I called him down with everybody else,\" cried Maria Macapa, \"as soon\nas I saw in the paper that Miss Sieppe had won. We all came down to Mr.\nSchouler's room and waited for you to come home. I think he must have\ngone back to his room. I'll bet you'll find him sewing up his books.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" observed Miss Baker, \"not at this hour.\"\n\nEvidently the timid old gentleman had taken advantage of the confusion\nto slip unobtrusively away.\n\n\"I'll go bring him down,\" shouted Marcus; \"he's got to join us.\"\n\nMiss Baker was in great agitation.\n\n\"I--I hardly think you'd better,\" she murmured; \"he--he--I don't think\nhe drinks beer.\"\n\n\"He takes his amusement in sewin' up books,\" cried Maria.\n\nMarcus brought him down, nevertheless, having found him just preparing\nfor bed.\n\n\"I--I must apologize,\" stammered Old Grannis, as he stood in the\ndoorway. \"I had not quite expected--I--find--find myself a little\nunprepared.\" He was without collar and cravat, owing to Marcus\nSchouler's precipitate haste. He was annoyed beyond words that Miss\nBaker saw him thus. Could anything be more embarrassing?\n\nOld Grannis was introduced to Mrs. Sieppe and to Trina as Marcus's\nemployer. They shook hands solemnly.\n\n\"I don't believe that he an' Miss Baker have ever been introduced,\"\ncried Maria Macapa, shrilly, \"an' they've been livin' side by side for\nyears.\"\n\nThe two old people were speechless, avoiding each other's gaze. It had\ncome at last; they were to know each other, to talk together, to touch\neach other's hands.\n\nMarcus brought Old Grannis around the table to little Miss Baker,\ndragging him by the coat sleeve, exclaiming: \"Well, I thought you two\npeople knew each other long ago. Miss Baker, this is Mr. Grannis; Mr.\nGrannis, this is Miss Baker.\" Neither spoke. Like two little children\nthey faced each other, awkward, constrained, tongue-tied with\nembarrassment. Then Miss Baker put out her hand shyly. Old Grannis\ntouched it for an instant and let it fall.\n\n\"Now you know each other,\" cried Marcus, \"and it's about time.\" For the\nfirst time their eyes met; Old Grannis trembled a little, putting his\nhand uncertainly to his chin. Miss Baker flushed ever so slightly, but\nMaria Macapa passed suddenly between them, carrying a half empty beer\nbottle. The two old people fell back from one another, Miss Baker\nresuming her seat.\n\n\"Here's a place for you over here, Mr. Grannis,\" cried Marcus,\nmaking room for him at his side. Old Grannis slipped into the chair,\nwithdrawing at once from the company's notice. He stared fixedly at\nhis plate and did not speak again. Old Miss Baker began to talk volubly\nacross the table to Mrs. Sieppe about hot-house flowers and medicated\nflannels.\n\nIt was in the midst of this little impromptu supper that the engagement\nof Trina and the dentist was announced. In a pause in the chatter of\nconversation Mrs. Sieppe leaned forward and, speaking to the agent,\nsaid:\n\n\"Vell, you know also my daughter Trina get married bretty soon. She and\nder dentist, Doktor McTeague, eh, yes?\"\n\nThere was a general exclamation.\n\n\"I thought so all along,\" cried Miss Baker, excitedly. \"The first time I\nsaw them together I said, 'What a pair!'\"\n\n\"Delightful!\" exclaimed the agent, \"to be married and win a snug little\nfortune at the same time.\"\n\n\"So--So,\" murmured Old Grannis, nodding at his plate.\n\n\"Good luck to you,\" cried Maria.\n\n\"He's lucky enough already,\" growled Marcus under his breath, relapsing\nfor a moment into one of those strange moods of sullenness which had\nmarked him throughout the evening.\n\nTrina flushed crimson, drawing shyly nearer her mother. McTeague grinned\nfrom ear to ear, looking around from one to another, exclaiming \"Huh!\nHuh!\"\n\nBut the agent rose to his feet, a newly filled beer glass in his hand.\nHe was a man of the world, this agent. He knew life. He was suave and\neasy. A diamond was on his little finger.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" he began. There was an instant silence. \"This\nis indeed a happy occasion. I--I am glad to be here to-night; to be a\nwitness to such good fortune; to partake in these--in this celebration.\nWhy, I feel almost as glad as if I had held four three oughts twelve\nmyself; as if the five thousand were mine instead of belonging to our\ncharming hostess. The good wishes of my humble self go out to Miss\nSieppe in this moment of her good fortune, and I think--in fact, I\nam sure I can speak for the great institution, the great company I\nrepresent. The company congratulates Miss Sieppe. We--they--ah--They\nwish her every happiness her new fortune can procure her. It has been my\nduty, my--ah--cheerful duty to call upon the winners of large prizes\nand to offer the felicitation of the company. I have, in my experience,\ncalled upon many such; but never have I seen fortune so happily bestowed\nas in this case. The company have dowered the prospective bride. I am\nsure I but echo the sentiments of this assembly when I wish all joy and\nhappiness to this happy pair, happy in the possession of a snug\nlittle fortune, and happy--happy in--\" he finished with a sudden\ninspiration--\"in the possession of each other; I drink to the health,\nwealth, and happiness of the future bride and groom. Let us drink\nstanding up.\" They drank with enthusiasm. Marcus was carried away with\nthe excitement of the moment.\n\n\"Outa sight, outa sight,\" he vociferated, clapping his hands. \"Very well\nsaid. To the health of the bride. McTeague, McTeague, speech, speech!\"\n\nIn an instant the whole table was clamoring for the dentist to speak.\nMcTeague was terrified; he gripped the table with both hands, looking\nwildly about him.\n\n\"Speech, speech!\" shouted Marcus, running around the table and\nendeavoring to drag McTeague up.\n\n\"No--no--no,\" muttered the other. \"No speech.\" The company rattled upon\nthe table with their beer glasses, insisting upon a speech. McTeague\nsettled obstinately into his chair, very red in the face, shaking his\nhead energetically.\n\n\"Ah, go on!\" he exclaimed; \"no speech.\"\n\n\"Ah, get up and say somethun, anyhow,\" persisted Marcus; \"you ought to\ndo it. It's the proper caper.\"\n\nMcTeague heaved himself up; there was a burst of applause; he looked\nslowly about him, then suddenly sat down again, shaking his head\nhopelessly.\n\n\"Oh, go on, Mac,\" cried Trina.\n\n\"Get up, say somethun, anyhow,\" cried Marcus, tugging at his arm; \"you\nGOT to.\"\n\nOnce more McTeague rose to his feet.\n\n\"Huh!\" he exclaimed, looking steadily at the table. Then he began:\n\n\"I don' know what to say--I--I--I ain't never made a speech before; I--I\nain't never made a speech before. But I'm glad Trina's won the prize--\"\n\n\"Yes, I'll bet you are,\" muttered Marcus.\n\n\"I--I--I'm glad Trina's won, and I--I want to--I want to--I want\nto--want to say that--you're--all--welcome, an' drink hearty, an' I'm\nmuch obliged to the agent. Trina and I are goin' to be married, an'\nI'm glad everybody's here to-night, an' you're--all--welcome, an'\ndrink hearty, an' I hope you'll come again, an' you're always\nwelcome--an'--I--an'--an'--That's--about--all--I--gotta say.\" He sat\ndown, wiping his forehead, amidst tremendous applause.\n\nSoon after that the company pushed back from the table and relaxed into\ncouples and groups. The men, with the exception of Old Grannis, began\nto smoke, the smell of their tobacco mingling with the odors of ether,\ncreosote, and stale bedding, which pervaded the \"Parlors.\" Soon the\nwindows had to be lowered from the top. Mrs. Sieppe and old Miss Baker\nsat together in the bay window exchanging confidences. Miss Baker had\nturned back the overskirt of her dress; a plate of cake was in her lap;\nfrom time to time she sipped her wine with the delicacy of a white cat.\nThe two women were much interested in each other. Miss Baker told Mrs.\nSieppe all about Old Grannis, not forgetting the fiction of the title\nand the unjust stepfather.\n\n\"He's quite a personage really,\" said Miss Baker.\n\nMrs. Sieppe led the conversation around to her children. \"Ach, Trina is\nsudge a goote girl,\" she said; \"always gay, yes, und sing from morgen\nto night. Und Owgooste, he is soh smart also, yes, eh? He has der genius\nfor machines, always making somethun mit wheels und sbrings.\"\n\n\"Ah, if--if--I had children,\" murmured the little old maid a trifle\nwistfully, \"one would have been a sailor; he would have begun as a\nmidshipman on my brother's ship; in time he would have been an officer.\nThe other would have been a landscape gardener.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mac!\" exclaimed Trina, looking up into the dentist's face, \"think\nof all this money coming to us just at this very moment. Isn't it\nwonderful? Don't it kind of scare you?\"\n\n\"Wonderful, wonderful!\" muttered McTeague, shaking his head. \"Let's buy\na lot of tickets,\" he added, struck with an idea.\n\n\"Now, that's how you can always tell a good cigar,\" observed the agent\nto Marcus as the two sat smoking at the end of the table. \"The light end\nshould be rolled to a point.\"\n\n\"Ah, the Chinese cigar-makers,\" cried Marcus, in a passion, brandishing\nhis fist. \"It's them as is ruining the cause of white labor. They are,\nthey are for a FACT. Ah, the rat-eaters! Ah, the white-livered curs!\"\n\nOver in the corner, by the stand of shelves, Old Grannis was listening\nto Maria Macapa. The Mexican woman had been violently stirred over\nTrina's sudden wealth; Maria's mind had gone back to her younger days.\nShe leaned forward, her elbows on her knees, her chin in her hands, her\neyes wide and fixed. Old Grannis listened to her attentively.\n\n\"There wa'n't a piece that was so much as scratched,\" Maria was saying.\n\"Every piece was just like a mirror, smooth and bright; oh, bright as a\nlittle sun. Such a service as that was--platters and soup tureens and an\nimmense big punchbowl. Five thousand dollars, what does that amount to?\nWhy, that punch-bowl alone was worth a fortune.\"\n\n\"What a wonderful story!\" exclaimed Old Grannis, never for an instant\ndoubting its truth. \"And it's all lost now, you say?\"\n\n\"Lost, lost,\" repeated Maria.\n\n\"Tut, tut! What a pity! What a pity!\"\n\nSuddenly the agent rose and broke out with:\n\n\"Well, I must be going, if I'm to get any car.\"\n\nHe shook hands with everybody, offered a parting cigar to Marcus,\ncongratulated McTeague and Trina a last time, and bowed himself out.\n\n\"What an elegant gentleman,\" commented Miss Baker.\n\n\"Ah,\" said Marcus, nodding his head, \"there's a man of the world for\nyou. Right on to himself, by damn!\"\n\nThe company broke up.\n\n\"Come along, Mac,\" cried Marcus; \"we're to sleep with the dogs to-night,\nyou know.\"\n\nThe two friends said \"Good-night\" all around and departed for the little\ndog hospital.\n\nOld Grannis hurried to his room furtively, terrified lest he should\nagain be brought face to face with Miss Baker. He bolted himself in and\nlistened until he heard her foot in the hall and the soft closing of\nher door. She was there close beside him; as one might say, in the same\nroom; for he, too, had made the discovery as to the similarity of the\nwallpaper. At long intervals he could hear a faint rustling as she moved\nabout. What an evening that had been for him! He had met her, had spoken\nto her, had touched her hand; he was in a tremor of excitement. In a\nlike manner the little old dressmaker listened and quivered. HE was\nthere in that same room which they shared in common, separated only by\nthe thinnest board partition. He was thinking of her, she was almost\nsure of it. They were strangers no longer; they were acquaintances,\nfriends. What an event that evening had been in their lives!\n\nLate as it was, Miss Baker brewed a cup of tea and sat down in her\nrocking chair close to the partition; she rocked gently, sipping her\ntea, calming herself after the emotions of that wonderful evening.\n\nOld Grannis heard the clinking of the tea things and smelt the faint\nodor of the tea. It seemed to him a signal, an invitation. He drew his\nchair close to his side of the partition, before his work-table. A pile\nof half-bound \"Nations\" was in the little binding apparatus; he threaded\nhis huge upholsterer's needle with stout twine and set to work.\n\nIt was their tete-a-tete. Instinctively they felt each other's presence,\nfelt each other's thought coming to them through the thin partition.\nIt was charming; they were perfectly happy. There in the stillness that\nsettled over the flat in the half hour after midnight the two old people\n\"kept company,\" enjoying after their fashion their little romance that\nhad come so late into the lives of each.\n\nOn the way to her room in the garret Maria Macapa paused under the\nsingle gas-jet that burned at the top of the well of the staircase; she\nassured herself that she was alone, and then drew from her pocket one of\nMcTeague's \"tapes\" of non-cohesive gold. It was the most valuable steal\nshe had ever yet made in the dentist's \"Parlors.\" She told herself that\nit was worth at least a couple of dollars. Suddenly an idea occurred\nto her, and she went hastily to a window at the end of the hall, and,\nshading her face with both hands, looked down into the little alley just\nback of the flat. On some nights Zerkow, the red-headed Polish Jew, sat\nup late, taking account of the week's ragpicking. There was a dim light\nin his window now.\n\nMaria went to her room, threw a shawl around her head, and descended\ninto the little back yard of the flat by the back stairs. As she let\nherself out of the back gate into the alley, Alexander, Marcus's Irish\nsetter, woke suddenly with a gruff bark. The collie who lived on the\nother side of the fence, in the back yard of the branch post-office,\nanswered with a snarl. Then in an instant the endless feud between\nthe two dogs was resumed. They dragged their respective kennels to the\nfence, and through the cracks raged at each other in a frenzy of hate;\ntheir teeth snapped and gleamed; the hackles on their backs rose and\nstiffened. Their hideous clamor could have been heard for blocks around.\nWhat a massacre should the two ever meet!\n\nMeanwhile, Maria was knocking at Zerkow's miserable hovel.\n\n\"Who is it? Who is it?\" cried the rag-picker from within, in his hoarse\nvoice, that was half whisper, starting nervously, and sweeping a handful\nof silver into his drawer.\n\n\"It's me, Maria Macapa;\" then in a lower voice, and as if speaking to\nherself, \"had a flying squirrel an' let him go.\"\n\n\"Ah, Maria,\" cried Zerkow, obsequiously opening the door. \"Come in, come\nin, my girl; you're always welcome, even as late as this. No junk, hey?\nBut you're welcome for all that. You'll have a drink, won't you?\" He led\nher into his back room and got down the whiskey bottle and the broken\nred tumbler.\n\nAfter the two had drunk together Maria produced the gold \"tape.\"\nZerkow's eyes glittered on the instant. The sight of gold invariably\nsent a qualm all through him; try as he would, he could not repress it.\nHis fingers trembled and clawed at his mouth; his breath grew short.\n\n\"Ah, ah, ah!\" he exclaimed, \"give it here, give it here; give it to me,\nMaria. That's a good girl, come give it to me.\"\n\nThey haggled as usual over the price, but to-night Maria was too excited\nover other matters to spend much time in bickering over a few cents.\n\n\"Look here, Zerkow,\" she said as soon as the transfer was made, \"I got\nsomething to tell you. A little while ago I sold a lottery ticket to a\ngirl at the flat; the drawing was in this evening's papers. How much do\nyou suppose that girl has won?\"\n\n\"I don't know. How much? How much?\"\n\n\"Five thousand dollars.\"\n\nIt was as though a knife had been run through the Jew; a spasm of an\nalmost physical pain twisted his face--his entire body. He raised his\nclenched fists into the air, his eyes shut, his teeth gnawing his lip.\n\n\"Five thousand dollars,\" he whispered; \"five thousand dollars. For what?\nFor nothing, for simply buying a ticket; and I have worked so hard for\nit, so hard, so hard. Five thousand dollars, five thousand dollars. Oh,\nwhy couldn't it have come to me?\" he cried, his voice choking, the\ntears starting to his eyes; \"why couldn't it have come to me? To come so\nclose, so close, and yet to miss me--me who have worked for it, fought\nfor it, starved for it, am dying for it every day. Think of it, Maria,\nfive thousand dollars, all bright, heavy pieces----\"\n\n\"Bright as a sunset,\" interrupted Maria, her chin propped on her hands.\n\"Such a glory, and heavy. Yes, every piece was heavy, and it was all\nyou could do to lift the punch-bowl. Why, that punch-bowl was worth a\nfortune alone----\"\n\n\"And it rang when you hit it with your knuckles, didn't it?\" prompted\nZerkow, eagerly, his lips trembling, his fingers hooking themselves into\nclaws.\n\n\"Sweeter'n any church bell,\" continued Maria.\n\n\"Go on, go on, go on,\" cried Zerkow, drawing his chair closer, and\nshutting his eyes in ecstasy.\n\n\"There were more than a hundred pieces, and every one of them gold----\"\n\n\"Ah, every one of them gold.\"\n\n\"You should have seen the sight when the leather trunk was opened.\nThere wa'n't a piece that was so much as scratched; every one was like\na mirror, smooth and bright, polished so that it looked black--you know\nhow I mean.\"\n\n\"Oh, I know, I know,\" cried Zerkow, moistening his lips.\n\nThen he plied her with questions--questions that covered every detail\nof that service of plate. It was soft, wasn't it? You could bite into a\nplate and leave a dent? The handles of the knives, now, were they gold,\ntoo? All the knife was made from one piece of gold, was it? And the\nforks the same? The interior of the trunk was quilted, of course? Did\nMaria ever polish the plates herself? When the company ate off this\nservice, it must have made a fine noise--these gold knives and forks\nclinking together upon these gold plates.\n\n\"Now, let's have it all over again, Maria,\" pleaded Zerkow. \"Begin\nnow with 'There were more than a hundred pieces, and every one of them\ngold.' Go on, begin, begin, begin!\"\n\nThe red-headed Pole was in a fever of excitement. Maria's recital had\nbecome a veritable mania with him. As he listened, with closed eyes and\ntrembling lips, he fancied he could see that wonderful plate before him,\nthere on the table, under his eyes, under his hand, ponderous, massive,\ngleaming. He tormented Maria into a second repetition of the story--into\na third. The more his mind dwelt upon it, the sharper grew his desire.\nThen, with Maria's refusal to continue the tale, came the reaction.\nZerkow awoke as from some ravishing dream. The plate was gone, was\nirretrievably lost. There was nothing in that miserable room but grimy\nrags and rust-corroded iron. What torment! what agony! to be so near--so\nnear, to see it in one's distorted fancy as plain as in a mirror. To\nknow every individual piece as an old friend; to feel its weight; to\nbe dazzled by its glitter; to call it one's own, own; to have it to\noneself, hugged to the breast; and then to start, to wake, to come down\nto the horrible reality.\n\n\"And you, YOU had it once,\" gasped Zerkow, clawing at her arm; \"you had\nit once, all your own. Think of it, and now it's gone.\"\n\n\"Gone for good and all.\"\n\n\"Perhaps it's buried near your old place somewhere.\"\n\n\"It's gone--gone--gone,\" chanted Maria in a monotone.\n\nZerkow dug his nails into his scalp, tearing at his red hair.\n\n\"Yes, yes, it's gone, it's gone--lost forever! Lost forever!\"\n\nMarcus and the dentist walked up the silent street and reached the\nlittle dog hospital. They had hardly spoken on the way. McTeague's brain\nwas in a whirl; speech failed him. He was busy thinking of the great\nthing that had happened that night, and was trying to realize what its\neffect would be upon his life--his life and Trina's. As soon as they had\nfound themselves in the street, Marcus had relapsed at once to a sullen\nsilence, which McTeague was too abstracted to notice.\n\nThey entered the tiny office of the hospital with its red carpet, its\ngas stove, and its colored prints of famous dogs hanging against the\nwalls. In one corner stood the iron bed which they were to occupy.\n\n\"You go on an' get to bed, Mac,\" observed Marcus. \"I'll take a look at\nthe dogs before I turn in.\"\n\nHe went outside and passed along into the yard, that was bounded on\nthree sides by pens where the dogs were kept. A bull terrier dying of\ngastritis recognized him and began to whimper feebly.\n\nMarcus paid no attention to the dogs. For the first time that evening he\nwas alone and could give vent to his thoughts. He took a couple of turns\nup and down the yard, then suddenly in a low voice exclaimed:\n\n\"You fool, you fool, Marcus Schouler! If you'd kept Trina you'd have\nhad that money. You might have had it yourself. You've thrown away your\nchance in life--to give up the girl, yes--but this,\" he stamped his foot\nwith rage--\"to throw five thousand dollars out of the window--to stuff\nit into the pockets of someone else, when it might have been yours, when\nyou might have had Trina AND the money--and all for what? Because we\nwere pals. Oh, 'pals' is all right--but five thousand dollars--to have\nplayed it right into his hands--God DAMN the luck!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\n\nThe next two months were delightful. Trina and McTeague saw each other\nregularly, three times a week. The dentist went over to B Street Sunday\nand Wednesday afternoons as usual; but on Fridays it was Trina who came\nto the city. She spent the morning between nine and twelve o'clock down\ntown, for the most part in the cheap department stores, doing the weekly\nshopping for herself and the family. At noon she took an uptown car and\nmet McTeague at the corner of Polk Street. The two lunched together at\na small uptown hotel just around the corner on Sutter Street. They\nwere given a little room to themselves. Nothing could have been more\ndelicious. They had but to close the sliding door to shut themselves off\nfrom the whole world.\n\nTrina would arrive breathless from her raids upon the bargain counters,\nher pale cheeks flushed, her hair blown about her face and into the\ncorners of her lips, her mother's net reticule stuffed to bursting. Once\nin their tiny private room, she would drop into her chair with a little\ngroan.\n\n\"Oh, MAC, I am so tired; I've just been all OVER town. Oh, it's good to\nsit down. Just think, I had to stand up in the car all the way, after\nbeing on my feet the whole blessed morning. Look here what I've bought.\nJust things and things. Look, there's some dotted veiling I got for\nmyself; see now, do you think it looks pretty?\"--she spread it over her\nface--\"and I got a box of writing paper, and a roll of crepe paper to\nmake a lamp shade for the front parlor; and--what do you suppose--I\nsaw a pair of Nottingham lace curtains for FORTY-NINE CENTS; isn't that\ncheap? and some chenille portieres for two and a half. Now what have\nYOU been doing since I last saw you? Did Mr. Heise finally get up enough\ncourage to have his tooth pulled yet?\" Trina took off her hat and veil\nand rearranged her hair before the looking-glass.\n\n\"No, no--not yet. I went down to the sign painter's yesterday afternoon\nto see about that big gold tooth for a sign. It costs too much; I can't\nget it yet a while. There's two kinds, one German gilt and the other\nFrench gilt; but the German gilt is no good.\"\n\nMcTeague sighed, and wagged his head. Even Trina and the five thousand\ndollars could not make him forget this one unsatisfied longing.\n\nAt other times they would talk at length over their plans, while Trina\nsipped her chocolate and McTeague devoured huge chunks of butterless\nbread. They were to be married at the end of May, and the dentist\nalready had his eye on a couple of rooms, part of the suite of a\nbankrupt photographer. They were situated in the flat, just back of his\n\"Parlors,\" and he believed the photographer would sublet them furnished.\n\nMcTeague and Trina had no apprehensions as to their finances. They could\nbe sure, in fact, of a tidy little income. The dentist's practice was\nfairly good, and they could count upon the interest of Trina's five\nthousand dollars. To McTeague's mind this interest seemed woefully\nsmall. He had had uncertain ideas about that five thousand dollars; had\nimagined that they would spend it in some lavish fashion; would buy\na house, perhaps, or would furnish their new rooms with overwhelming\nluxury--luxury that implied red velvet carpets and continued feasting.\nThe oldtime miner's idea of wealth easily gained and quickly spent\npersisted in his mind. But when Trina had begun to talk of investments\nand interests and per cents, he was troubled and not a little\ndisappointed. The lump sum of five thousand dollars was one thing, a\nmiserable little twenty or twenty-five a month was quite another; and\nthen someone else had the money.\n\n\"But don't you see, Mac,\" explained Trina, \"it's ours just the same. We\ncould get it back whenever we wanted it; and then it's the reasonable\nway to do. We mustn't let it turn our heads, Mac, dear, like that man\nthat spent all he won in buying more tickets. How foolish we'd feel\nafter we'd spent it all! We ought to go on just the same as before; as\nif we hadn't won. We must be sensible about it, mustn't we?\"\n\n\"Well, well, I guess perhaps that's right,\" the dentist would answer,\nlooking slowly about on the floor.\n\nJust what should ultimately be done with the money was the subject of\nendless discussion in the Sieppe family. The savings bank would allow\nonly three per cent., but Trina's parents believed that something better\ncould be got.\n\n\"There's Uncle Oelbermann,\" Trina had suggested, remembering the rich\nrelative who had the wholesale toy store in the Mission.\n\nMr. Sieppe struck his hand to his forehead. \"Ah, an idea,\" he cried.\nIn the end an agreement was made. The money was invested in Mr.\nOelbermann's business. He gave Trina six per cent.\n\nInvested in this fashion, Trina's winning would bring in twenty-five\ndollars a month. But, besides this, Trina had her own little trade. She\nmade Noah's ark animals for Uncle Oelbermann's store. Trina's ancestors\non both sides were German-Swiss, and some long-forgotten forefather of\nthe sixteenth century, some worsted-leggined wood-carver of the Tyrol,\nhad handed down the talent of the national industry, to reappear in this\nstrangely distorted guise.\n\nShe made Noah's ark animals, whittling them out of a block of soft wood\nwith a sharp jack-knife, the only instrument she used. Trina was very\nproud to explain her work to McTeague as he had already explained his\nown to her.\n\n\"You see, I take a block of straight-grained pine and cut out the shape,\nroughly at first, with the big blade; then I go over it a second time\nwith the little blade, more carefully; then I put in the ears and tail\nwith a drop of glue, and paint it with a 'non-poisonous' paint--Vandyke\nbrown for the horses, foxes, and cows; slate gray for the elephants and\ncamels; burnt umber for the chickens, zebras, and so on; then, last, a\ndot of Chinese white for the eyes, and there you are, all finished. They\nsell for nine cents a dozen. Only I can't make the manikins.\"\n\n\"The manikins?\"\n\n\"The little figures, you know--Noah and his wife, and Shem, and all the\nothers.\"\n\nIt was true. Trina could not whittle them fast enough and cheap enough\nto compete with the turning lathe, that could throw off whole tribes\nand peoples of manikins while she was fashioning one family. Everything\nelse, however, she made--the ark itself, all windows and no door; the\nbox in which the whole was packed; even down to pasting on the label,\nwhich read, \"Made in France.\" She earned from three to four dollars a\nweek.\n\nThe income from these three sources, McTeague's profession, the interest\nof the five thousand dollars, and Trina's whittling, made a respectable\nlittle sum taken altogether. Trina declared they could even lay by\nsomething, adding to the five thousand dollars little by little.\n\nIt soon became apparent that Trina would be an extraordinarily good\nhousekeeper. Economy was her strong point. A good deal of peasant blood\nstill ran undiluted in her veins, and she had all the instinct of a\nhardy and penurious mountain race--the instinct which saves without any\nthought, without idea of consequence--saving for the sake of saving,\nhoarding without knowing why. Even McTeague did not know how closely\nTrina held to her new-found wealth.\n\nBut they did not always pass their luncheon hour in this discussion\nof incomes and economies. As the dentist came to know his little woman\nbetter she grew to be more and more of a puzzle and a joy to him. She\nwould suddenly interrupt a grave discourse upon the rents of rooms and\nthe cost of light and fuel with a brusque outburst of affection that\nset him all a-tremble with delight. All at once she would set down her\nchocolate, and, leaning across the narrow table, would exclaim:\n\n\"Never mind all that! Oh, Mac, do you truly, really love me--love me\nBIG?\"\n\nMcTeague would stammer something, gasping, and wagging his head, beside\nhimself for the lack of words.\n\n\"Old bear,\" Trina would answer, grasping him by both huge ears and\nswaying his head from side to side. \"Kiss me, then. Tell me, Mac, did\nyou think any less of me that first time I let you kiss me there in the\nstation? Oh, Mac, dear, what a funny nose you've got, all full of hairs\ninside; and, Mac, do you know you've got a bald spot--\" she dragged his\nhead down towards her--\"right on the top of your head.\" Then she would\nseriously kiss the bald spot in question, declaring:\n\n\"That'll make the hair grow.\"\n\nTrina took an infinite enjoyment in playing with McTeague's great\nsquare-cut head, rumpling his hair till it stood on end, putting her\nfingers in his eyes, or stretching his ears out straight, and watching\nthe effect with her head on one side. It was like a little child playing\nwith some gigantic, good-natured Saint Bernard.\n\nOne particular amusement they never wearied of. The two would lean\nacross the table towards each other, McTeague folding his arms under his\nbreast. Then Trina, resting on her elbows, would part his mustache-the\ngreat blond mustache of a viking--with her two hands, pushing it up from\nhis lips, causing his face to assume the appearance of a Greek mask. She\nwould curl it around either forefinger, drawing it to a fine end. Then\nall at once McTeague would make a fearful snorting noise through his\nnose. Invariably--though she was expecting this, though it was part of\nthe game--Trina would jump with a stifled shriek. McTeague would bellow\nwith laughter till his eyes watered. Then they would recommence upon the\ninstant, Trina protesting with a nervous tremulousness:\n\n\"Now--now--now, Mac, DON'T; you SCARE me so.\"\n\nBut these delicious tete-a-tetes with Trina were offset by a certain\ncoolness that Marcus Schouler began to affect towards the dentist. At\nfirst McTeague was unaware of it; but by this time even his slow wits\nbegan to perceive that his best friend--his \"pal\"--was not the same to\nhim as formerly. They continued to meet at lunch nearly every day but\nFriday at the car conductors' coffee-joint. But Marcus was sulky; there\ncould be no doubt about that. He avoided talking to McTeague, read the\npaper continually, answering the dentist's timid efforts at conversation\nin gruff monosyllables. Sometimes, even, he turned sideways to the table\nand talked at great length to Heise the harness-maker, whose table was\nnext to theirs. They took no more long walks together when Marcus\nwent out to exercise the dogs. Nor did Marcus ever again recur to his\ngenerosity in renouncing Trina.\n\nOne Tuesday, as McTeague took his place at the table in the\ncoffee-joint, he found Marcus already there.\n\n\"Hello, Mark,\" said the dentist, \"you here already?\"\n\n\"Hello,\" returned the other, indifferently, helping himself to tomato\ncatsup. There was a silence. After a long while Marcus suddenly looked\nup.\n\n\"Say, Mac,\" he exclaimed, \"when you going to pay me that money you owe\nme?\"\n\nMcTeague was astonished.\n\n\"Huh? What? I don't--do I owe you any money, Mark?\"\n\n\"Well, you owe me four bits,\" returned Marcus, doggedly. \"I paid for you\nand Trina that day at the picnic, and you never gave it back.\"\n\n\"Oh--oh!\" answered McTeague, in distress. \"That's so, that's so. I--you\nought to have told me before. Here's your money, and I'm obliged to\nyou.\"\n\n\"It ain't much,\" observed Marcus, sullenly. \"But I need all I can get\nnow-a-days.\"\n\n\"Are you--are you broke?\" inquired McTeague.\n\n\"And I ain't saying anything about your sleeping at the hospital that\nnight, either,\" muttered Marcus, as he pocketed the coin.\n\n\"Well--well--do you mean--should I have paid for that?\"\n\n\"Well, you'd 'a' had to sleep SOMEWHERES, wouldn't you?\" flashed out\nMarcus. \"You 'a' had to pay half a dollar for a bed at the flat.\"\n\n\"All right, all right,\" cried the dentist, hastily, feeling in his\npockets. \"I don't want you should be out anything on my account, old\nman. Here, will four bits do?\"\n\n\"I don't WANT your damn money,\" shouted Marcus in a sudden rage,\nthrowing back the coin. \"I ain't no beggar.\"\n\nMcTeague was miserable. How had he offended his pal?\n\n\"Well, I want you should take it, Mark,\" he said, pushing it towards\nhim.\n\n\"I tell you I won't touch your money,\" exclaimed the other through his\nclenched teeth, white with passion. \"I've been played for a sucker long\nenough.\"\n\n\"What's the matter with you lately, Mark?\" remonstrated McTeague.\n\"You've got a grouch about something. Is there anything I've done?\"\n\n\"Well, that's all right, that's all right,\" returned Marcus as he rose\nfrom the table. \"That's all right. I've been played for a sucker long\nenough, that's all. I've been played for a sucker long enough.\" He went\naway with a parting malevolent glance.\n\nAt the corner of Polk Street, between the flat and the car conductors'\ncoffee-joint, was Frenna's. It was a corner grocery; advertisements for\ncheap butter and eggs, painted in green marking-ink upon wrapping paper,\nstood about on the sidewalk outside. The doorway was decorated with a\nhuge Milwaukee beer sign. Back of the store proper was a bar where white\nsand covered the floor. A few tables and chairs were scattered here\nand there. The walls were hung with gorgeously-colored tobacco\nadvertisements and colored lithographs of trotting horses. On the wall\nbehind the bar was a model of a full-rigged ship enclosed in a bottle.\n\nIt was at this place that the dentist used to leave his pitcher to\nbe filled on Sunday afternoons. Since his engagement to Trina he had\ndiscontinued this habit. However, he still dropped into Frenna's one or\ntwo nights in the week. He spent a pleasant hour there, smoking his huge\nporcelain pipe and drinking his beer. He never joined any of the groups\nof piquet players around the tables. In fact, he hardly spoke to anyone\nbut the bartender and Marcus.\n\nFor Frenna's was one of Marcus Schouler's haunts; a great deal of his\ntime was spent there. He involved himself in fearful political and\nsocial discussions with Heise the harness-maker, and with one or two old\nGerman, habitues of the place. These discussions Marcus carried on, as\nwas his custom, at the top of his voice, gesticulating fiercely, banging\nthe table with his fists, brandishing the plates and glasses, exciting\nhimself with his own clamor.\n\nOn a certain Saturday evening, a few days after the scene at the\ncoffee-joint, the dentist bethought him to spend a quiet evening at\nFrenna's. He had not been there for some time, and, besides that, it\noccurred to him that the day was his birthday. He would permit himself\nan extra pipe and a few glasses of beer. When McTeague entered Frenna's\nback room by the street door, he found Marcus and Heise already\ninstalled at one of the tables. Two or three of the old Germans sat\nopposite them, gulping their beer from time to time. Heise was smoking\na cigar, but Marcus had before him his fourth whiskey cocktail. At the\nmoment of McTeague's entrance Marcus had the floor.\n\n\"It can't be proven,\" he was yelling. \"I defy any sane politician whose\neyes are not blinded by party prejudices, whose opinions are not warped\nby a personal bias, to substantiate such a statement. Look at your\nfacts, look at your figures. I am a free American citizen, ain't I?\nI pay my taxes to support a good government, don't I? It's a contract\nbetween me and the government, ain't it? Well, then, by damn! if the\nauthorities do not or will not afford me protection for life, liberty,\nand the pursuit of happiness, then my obligations are at an end; I\nwithhold my taxes. I do--I do--I say I do. What?\" He glared about him,\nseeking opposition.\n\n\"That's nonsense,\" observed Heise, quietly. \"Try it once; you'll get\njugged.\" But this observation of the harness-maker's roused Marcus to\nthe last pitch of frenzy.\n\n\"Yes, ah, yes!\" he shouted, rising to his feet, shaking his finger in\nthe other's face. \"Yes, I'd go to jail; but because I--I am crushed by a\ntyranny, does that make the tyranny right? Does might make right?\"\n\n\"You must make less noise in here, Mister Schouler,\" said Frenna, from\nbehind the bar.\n\n\"Well, it makes me mad,\" answered Marcus, subsiding into a growl and\nresuming his chair. \"Hullo, Mac.\"\n\n\"Hullo, Mark.\"\n\nBut McTeague's presence made Marcus uneasy, rousing in him at once a\nsense of wrong. He twisted to and fro in his chair, shrugging first one\nshoulder and then another. Quarrelsome at all times, the heat of\nthe previous discussion had awakened within him all his natural\ncombativeness. Besides this, he was drinking his fourth cocktail.\n\nMcTeague began filling his big porcelain pipe. He lit it, blew a great\ncloud of smoke into the room, and settled himself comfortably in his\nchair. The smoke of his cheap tobacco drifted into the faces of\nthe group at the adjoining table, and Marcus strangled and coughed.\nInstantly his eyes flamed.\n\n\"Say, for God's sake,\" he vociferated, \"choke off on that pipe! If\nyou've got to smoke rope like that, smoke it in a crowd of muckers;\ndon't come here amongst gentlemen.\"\n\n\"Shut up, Schouler!\" observed Heise in a low voice.\n\nMcTeague was stunned by the suddenness of the attack. He took his pipe\nfrom his mouth, and stared blankly at Marcus; his lips moved, but he\nsaid no word. Marcus turned his back on him, and the dentist resumed his\npipe.\n\nBut Marcus was far from being appeased. McTeague could not hear the talk\nthat followed between him and the harnessmaker, but it seemed to him\nthat Marcus was telling Heise of some injury, some grievance, and that\nthe latter was trying to pacify him. All at once their talk grew louder.\nHeise laid a retaining hand upon his companion's coat sleeve, but Marcus\nswung himself around in his chair, and, fixing his eyes on McTeague,\ncried as if in answer to some protestation on the part of Heise:\n\n\"All I know is that I've been soldiered out of five thousand dollars.\"\n\nMcTeague gaped at him, bewildered. He removed his pipe from his mouth\na second time, and stared at Marcus with eyes full of trouble and\nperplexity.\n\n\"If I had my rights,\" cried Marcus, bitterly, \"I'd have part of that\nmoney. It's my due--it's only justice.\" The dentist still kept silence.\n\n\"If it hadn't been for me,\" Marcus continued, addressing himself\ndirectly to McTeague, \"you wouldn't have had a cent of it--no, not a\ncent. Where's my share, I'd like to know? Where do I come in? No, I\nain't in it any more. I've been played for a sucker, an' now that you've\ngot all you can out of me, now that you've done me out of my girl and\nout of my money, you give me the go-by. Why, where would you have\nbeen TO-DAY if it hadn't been for me?\" Marcus shouted in a sudden\nexasperation, \"You'd a been plugging teeth at two bits an hour. Ain't\nyou got any gratitude? Ain't you got any sense of decency?\"\n\n\"Ah, hold up, Schouler,\" grumbled Heise. \"You don't want to get into a\nrow.\"\n\n\"No, I don't, Heise,\" returned Marcus, with a plaintive, aggrieved air.\n\"But it's too much sometimes when you think of it. He stole away my\ngirl's affections, and now that he's rich and prosperous, and has got\nfive thousand dollars that I might have had, he gives me the go-by; he's\nplayed me for a sucker. Look here,\" he cried, turning again to McTeague,\n\"do I get any of that money?\"\n\n\"It ain't mine to give,\" answered McTeague. \"You're drunk, that's what\nyou are.\"\n\n\"Do I get any of that money?\" cried Marcus, persistently.\n\nThe dentist shook his head. \"No, you don't get any of it.\"\n\n\"Now--NOW,\" clamored the other, turning to the harnessmaker, as though\nthis explained everything. \"Look at that, look at that. Well, I've done\nwith you from now on.\" Marcus had risen to his feet by this time and\nmade as if to leave, but at every instant he came back, shouting his\nphrases into McTeague's face, moving off again as he spoke the last\nwords, in order to give them better effect.\n\n\"This settles it right here. I've done with you. Don't you ever dare\nspeak to me again\"--his voice was shaking with fury--\"and don't you sit\nat my table in the restaurant again. I'm sorry I ever lowered myself\nto keep company with such dirt. Ah, one-horse dentist! Ah, ten-cent\nzinc-plugger--hoodlum--MUCKER! Get your damn smoke outa my face.\"\n\nThen matters reached a sudden climax. In his agitation the dentist had\nbeen pulling hard on his pipe, and as Marcus for the last time thrust\nhis face close to his own, McTeague, in opening his lips to reply,\nblew a stifling, acrid cloud directly in Marcus Schouler's eyes. Marcus\nknocked the pipe from his fingers with a sudden flash of his hand; it\nspun across the room and broke into a dozen fragments in a far corner.\n\nMcTeague rose to his feet, his eyes wide. But as yet he was not angry,\nonly surprised, taken all aback by the suddenness of Marcus Schouler's\noutbreak as well as by its unreasonableness. Why had Marcus broken his\npipe? What did it all mean, anyway? As he rose the dentist made a vague\nmotion with his right hand. Did Marcus misinterpret it as a gesture of\nmenace? He sprang back as though avoiding a blow. All at once there was\na cry. Marcus had made a quick, peculiar motion, swinging his arm upward\nwith a wide and sweeping gesture; his jack-knife lay open in his palm;\nit shot forward as he flung it, glinted sharply by McTeague's head, and\nstruck quivering into the wall behind.\n\nA sudden chill ran through the room; the others stood transfixed, as at\nthe swift passage of some cold and deadly wind. Death had stooped there\nfor an instant, had stooped and past, leaving a trail of terror and\nconfusion. Then the door leading to the street slammed; Marcus had\ndisappeared.\n\nThereon a great babel of exclamation arose. The tension of that all but\nfatal instant snapped, and speech became once more possible.\n\n\"He would have knifed you.\"\n\n\"Narrow escape.\"\n\n\"What kind of a man do you call THAT?\"\n\n\"'Tain't his fault he ain't a murderer.\"\n\n\"I'd have him up for it.\"\n\n\"And they two have been the greatest kind of friends.\"\n\n\"He didn't touch you, did he?\"\n\n\"No--no--no.\"\n\n\"What a--what a devil! What treachery! A regular greaser trick!\"\n\n\"Look out he don't stab you in the back. If that's the kind of man he\nis, you never can tell.\"\n\nFrenna drew the knife from the wall.\n\n\"Guess I'll keep this toad-stabber,\" he observed. \"That fellow won't\ncome round for it in a hurry; goodsized blade, too.\" The group examined\nit with intense interest.\n\n\"Big enough to let the life out of any man,\" observed Heise.\n\n\"What--what--what did he do it for?\" stammered McTeague. \"I got no\nquarrel with him.\"\n\nHe was puzzled and harassed by the strangeness of it all. Marcus would\nhave killed him; had thrown his knife at him in the true, uncanny\n\"greaser\" style. It was inexplicable. McTeague sat down again, looking\nstupidly about on the floor. In a corner of the room his eye encountered\nhis broken pipe, a dozen little fragments of painted porcelain and the\nstem of cherry wood and amber.\n\nAt that sight his tardy wrath, ever lagging behind the original affront,\nsuddenly blazed up. Instantly his huge jaws clicked together.\n\n\"He can't make small of ME,\" he exclaimed, suddenly. \"I'll show Marcus\nSchouler--I'll show him--I'll----\"\n\nHe got up and clapped on his hat.\n\n\"Now, Doctor,\" remonstrated Heise, standing between him and the door,\n\"don't go make a fool of yourself.\"\n\n\"Let 'um alone,\" joined in Frenna, catching the dentist by the arm;\n\"he's full, anyhow.\"\n\n\"He broke my pipe,\" answered McTeague.\n\nIt was this that had roused him. The thrown knife, the attempt on\nhis life, was beyond his solution; but the breaking of his pipe he\nunderstood clearly enough.\n\n\"I'll show him,\" he exclaimed.\n\nAs though they had been little children, McTeague set Frenna and the\nharness-maker aside, and strode out at the door like a raging elephant.\nHeise stood rubbing his shoulder.\n\n\"Might as well try to stop a locomotive,\" he muttered. \"The man's made\nof iron.\"\n\nMeanwhile, McTeague went storming up the street toward the flat, wagging\nhis head and grumbling to himself. Ah, Marcus would break his pipe,\nwould he? Ah, he was a zinc-plugger, was he? He'd show Marcus Schouler.\nNo one should make small of him. He tramped up the stairs to Marcus's\nroom. The door was locked. The dentist put one enormous hand on the knob\nand pushed the door in, snapping the wood-work, tearing off the lock.\nNobody--the room was dark and empty. Never mind, Marcus would have to\ncome home some time that night. McTeague would go down and wait for him\nin his \"Parlors.\" He was bound to hear him as he came up the stairs.\n\nAs McTeague reached his room he stumbled over, in the darkness, a big\npacking-box that stood in the hallway just outside his door. Puzzled, he\nstepped over it, and lighting the gas in his room, dragged it inside and\nexamined it.\n\nIt was addressed to him. What could it mean? He was expecting nothing.\nNever since he had first furnished his room had packing-cases been left\nfor him in this fashion. No mistake was possible. There were his name\nand address unmistakably. \"Dr. McTeague, dentist--Polk Street, San\nFrancisco, Cal.,\" and the red Wells Fargo tag.\n\nSeized with the joyful curiosity of an overgrown boy, he pried off the\nboards with the corner of his fireshovel. The case was stuffed full\nof excelsior. On the top lay an envelope addressed to him in Trina's\nhandwriting. He opened it and read, \"For my dear Mac's birthday, from\nTrina;\" and below, in a kind of post-script, \"The man will be round\nto-morrow to put it in place.\" McTeague tore away the excelsior.\nSuddenly he uttered an exclamation.\n\nIt was the Tooth--the famous golden molar with its huge prongs--his\nsign, his ambition, the one unrealized dream of his life; and it was\nFrench gilt, too, not the cheap German gilt that was no good. Ah, what\na dear little woman was this Trina, to keep so quiet, to remember his\nbirthday!\n\n\"Ain't she--ain't she just a--just a JEWEL,\" exclaimed McTeague under\nhis breath, \"a JEWEL--yes, just a JEWEL; that's the word.\"\n\nVery carefully he removed the rest of the excelsior, and lifting the\nponderous Tooth from its box, set it upon the marble-top centre table.\nHow immense it looked in that little room! The thing was tremendous,\noverpowering--the tooth of a gigantic fossil, golden and dazzling.\nBeside it everything seemed dwarfed. Even McTeague himself, big boned\nand enormous as he was, shrank and dwindled in the presence of the\nmonster. As for an instant he bore it in his hands, it was like a puny\nGulliver struggling with the molar of some vast Brobdingnag.\n\nThe dentist circled about that golden wonder, gasping with delight\nand stupefaction, touching it gingerly with his hands as if it were\nsomething sacred. At every moment his thought returned to Trina.\nNo, never was there such a little woman as his--the very thing he\nwanted--how had she remembered? And the money, where had that come from?\nNo one knew better than he how expensive were these signs; not another\ndentist on Polk Street could afford one. Where, then, had Trina found\nthe money? It came out of her five thousand dollars, no doubt.\n\nBut what a wonderful, beautiful tooth it was, to be sure, bright as a\nmirror, shining there in its coat of French gilt, as if with a light of\nits own! No danger of that tooth turning black with the weather, as did\nthe cheap German gilt impostures. What would that other dentist, that\nposer, that rider of bicycles, that courser of greyhounds, say when he\nshould see this marvellous molar run out from McTeague's bay window like\na flag of defiance? No doubt he would suffer veritable convulsions of\nenvy; would be positively sick with jealousy. If McTeague could only see\nhis face at the moment!\n\nFor a whole hour the dentist sat there in his little \"Parlor,\" gazing\necstatically at his treasure, dazzled, supremely content. The whole room\ntook on a different aspect because of it. The stone pug dog before the\nlittle stove reflected it in his protruding eyes; the canary woke and\nchittered feebly at this new gilt, so much brighter than the bars of its\nlittle prison. Lorenzo de' Medici, in the steel engraving, sitting in\nthe heart of his court, seemed to ogle the thing out of the corner of\none eye, while the brilliant colors of the unused rifle manufacturer's\ncalendar seemed to fade and pale in the brilliance of this greater\nglory.\n\nAt length, long after midnight, the dentist started to go to bed,\nundressing himself with his eyes still fixed on the great tooth. All at\nonce he heard Marcus Schouler's foot on the stairs; he started up with\nhis fists clenched, but immediately dropped back upon the bed-lounge\nwith a gesture of indifference.\n\nHe was in no truculent state of mind now. He could not reinstate himself\nin that mood of wrath wherein he had left the corner grocery. The tooth\nhad changed all that. What was Marcus Schouler's hatred to him, who had\nTrina's affection? What did he care about a broken pipe now that he had\nthe tooth? Let him go. As Frenna said, he was not worth it. He heard\nMarcus come out into the hall, shouting aggrievedly to anyone within\nsound of his voice:\n\n\"An' now he breaks into my room--into my room, by damn! How do I know\nhow many things he's stolen? It's come to stealing from me, now, has\nit?\" He went into his room, banging his splintered door.\n\nMcTeague looked upward at the ceiling, in the direction of the voice,\nmuttering:\n\n\"Ah, go to bed, you.\"\n\nHe went to bed himself, turning out the gas, but leaving the\nwindow-curtains up so that he could see the tooth the last thing before\nhe went to sleep and the first thing as he arose in the morning.\n\nBut he was restless during the night. Every now and then he was awakened\nby noises to which he had long since become accustomed. Now it was the\ncackling of the geese in the deserted market across the street; now it\nwas the stoppage of the cable, the sudden silence coming almost like\na shock; and now it was the infuriated barking of the dogs in the back\nyard--Alec, the Irish setter, and the collie that belonged to the branch\npost-office raging at each other through the fence, snarling their\nendless hatred into each other's faces. As often as he woke, McTeague\nturned and looked for the tooth, with a sudden suspicion that he\nhad only that moment dreamed the whole business. But he always found\nit--Trina's gift, his birthday from his little woman--a huge, vague\nbulk, looming there through the half darkness in the centre of the room,\nshining dimly out as if with some mysterious light of its own.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 9\n\n\nTrina and McTeague were married on the first day of June, in the\nphotographer's rooms that the dentist had rented. All through May the\nSieppe household had been turned upside down. The little box of a\nhouse vibrated with excitement and confusion, for not only were the\npreparations for Trina's marriage to be made, but also the preliminaries\nwere to be arranged for the hegira of the entire Sieppe family.\n\nThey were to move to the southern part of the State the day after\nTrina's marriage, Mr. Sieppe having bought a third interest in an\nupholstering business in the suburbs of Los Angeles. It was possible\nthat Marcus Schouler would go with them.\n\nNot Stanley penetrating for the first time into the Dark Continent,\nnot Napoleon leading his army across the Alps, was more weighted with\nresponsibility, more burdened with care, more overcome with the sense\nof the importance of his undertaking, than was Mr. Sieppe during this\nperiod of preparation. From dawn to dark, from dark to early dawn, he\ntoiled and planned and fretted, organizing and reorganizing, projecting\nand devising. The trunks were lettered, A, B, and C, the packages and\nsmaller bundles numbered. Each member of the family had his especial\nduty to perform, his particular bundles to oversee. Not a detail was\nforgotten--fares, prices, and tips were calculated to two places of\ndecimals. Even the amount of food that it would be necessary to carry\nfor the black greyhound was determined. Mrs. Sieppe was to look after\nthe lunch, \"der gomisariat.\" Mr. Sieppe would assume charge of the\nchecks, the money, the tickets, and, of course, general supervision. The\ntwins would be under the command of Owgooste, who, in turn, would report\nfor orders to his father.\n\nDay in and day out these minutiae were rehearsed. The children were\ndrilled in their parts with a military exactitude; obedience and\npunctuality became cardinal virtues. The vast importance of the\nundertaking was insisted upon with scrupulous iteration. It was a\nmanoeuvre, an army changing its base of operations, a veritable tribal\nmigration.\n\nOn the other hand, Trina's little room was the centre around which\nrevolved another and different order of things. The dressmaker came\nand went, congratulatory visitors invaded the little front parlor,\nthe chatter of unfamiliar voices resounded from the front steps;\nbonnet-boxes and yards of dress-goods littered the beds and chairs;\nwrapping paper, tissue paper, and bits of string strewed the floor;\na pair of white satin slippers stood on a corner of the toilet table;\nlengths of white veiling, like a snow-flurry, buried the little\nwork-table; and a mislaid box of artificial orange blossoms was finally\ndiscovered behind the bureau.\n\nThe two systems of operation often clashed and tangled. Mrs. Sieppe was\nfound by her harassed husband helping Trina with the waist of her gown\nwhen she should have been slicing cold chicken in the kitchen. Mr.\nSieppe packed his frock coat, which he would have to wear at the\nwedding, at the very bottom of \"Trunk C.\" The minister, who called to\noffer his congratulations and to make arrangements, was mistaken for the\nexpressman.\n\nMcTeague came and went furtively, dizzied and made uneasy by all this\nbustle. He got in the way; he trod upon and tore breadths of silk; he\ntried to help carry the packing-boxes, and broke the hall gas fixture;\nhe came in upon Trina and the dress-maker at an ill-timed moment, and\nretiring precipitately, overturned the piles of pictures stacked in the\nhall.\n\nThere was an incessant going and coming at every moment of the day,\na great calling up and down stairs, a shouting from room to room, an\nopening and shutting of doors, and an intermittent sound of hammering\nfrom the laundry, where Mr. Sieppe in his shirt sleeves labored among\nthe packing-boxes. The twins clattered about on the carpetless floors of\nthe denuded rooms. Owgooste was smacked from hour to hour, and wept upon\nthe front stairs; the dressmaker called over the banisters for a hot\nflatiron; expressmen tramped up and down the stairway. Mrs. Sieppe\nstopped in the preparation of the lunches to call \"Hoop, Hoop\" to the\ngreyhound, throwing lumps of coal. The dog-wheel creaked, the front door\nbell rang, delivery wagons rumbled away, windows rattled--the little\nhouse was in a positive uproar.\n\nAlmost every day of the week now Trina was obliged to run over to town\nand meet McTeague. No more philandering over their lunch now-a-days. It\nwas business now. They haunted the house-furnishing floors of the great\ndepartment houses, inspecting and pricing ranges, hardware, china,\nand the like. They rented the photographer's rooms furnished, and\nfortunately only the kitchen and dining-room utensils had to be bought.\n\nThe money for this as well as for her trousseau came out of Trina's\nfive thousand dollars. For it had been finally decided that two hundred\ndollars of this amount should be devoted to the establishment of the\nnew household. Now that Trina had made her great winning, Mr. Sieppe\nno longer saw the necessity of dowering her further, especially when he\nconsidered the enormous expense to which he would be put by the voyage\nof his own family.\n\nIt had been a dreadful wrench for Trina to break in upon her precious\nfive thousand. She clung to this sum with a tenacity that\nwas surprising; it had become for her a thing miraculous, a\ngod-from-the-machine, suddenly descending upon the stage of her humble\nlittle life; she regarded it as something almost sacred and inviolable.\nNever, never should a penny of it be spent. Before she could be induced\nto part with two hundred dollars of it, more than one scene had been\nenacted between her and her parents.\n\nDid Trina pay for the golden tooth out of this two hundred? Later on,\nthe dentist often asked her about it, but Trina invariably laughed in\nhis face, declaring that it was her secret. McTeague never found out.\n\nOne day during this period McTeague told Trina about his affair with\nMarcus. Instantly she was aroused.\n\n\"He threw his knife at you! The coward! He wouldn't of dared stand up to\nyou like a man. Oh, Mac, suppose he HAD hit you?\"\n\n\"Came within an inch of my head,\" put in McTeague, proudly.\n\n\"Think of it!\" she gasped; \"and he wanted part of my money. Well, I do\nlike his cheek; part of my five thousand! Why, it's mine, every single\npenny of it. Marcus hasn't the least bit of right to it. It's mine,\nmine.--I mean, it's ours, Mac, dear.\"\n\nThe elder Sieppes, however, made excuses for Marcus. He had probably\nbeen drinking a good deal and didn't know what he was about. He had a\ndreadful temper, anyhow. Maybe he only wanted to scare McTeague.\n\nThe week before the marriage the two men were reconciled. Mrs. Sieppe\nbrought them together in the front parlor of the B Street house.\n\n\"Now, you two fellers, don't be dot foolish. Schake hands und maig ut\noop, soh.\"\n\nMarcus muttered an apology. McTeague, miserably embarrassed, rolled\nhis eyes about the room, murmuring, \"That's all right--that's all\nright--that's all right.\"\n\nHowever, when it was proposed that Marcus should be McTeague's best man,\nhe flashed out again with renewed violence. Ah, no! ah, NO! He'd make up\nwith the dentist now that he was going away, but he'd be damned--yes, he\nwould--before he'd be his best man. That was rubbing it in. Let him get\nOld Grannis.\n\n\"I'm friends with um all right,\" vociferated Marcus, \"but I'll not stand\nup with um. I'll not be ANYBODY'S best man, I won't.\"\n\nThe wedding was to be very quiet; Trina preferred it that way. McTeague\nwould invite only Miss Baker and Heise the harness-maker. The Sieppes\nsent cards to Selina, who was counted on to furnish the music; to\nMarcus, of course; and to Uncle Oelbermann.\n\nAt last the great day, the first of June, arrived. The Sieppes had\npacked their last box and had strapped the last trunk. Trina's\ntwo trunks had already been sent to her new home--the remodelled\nphotographer's rooms. The B Street house was deserted; the whole family\ncame over to the city on the last day of May and stopped over night at\none of the cheap downtown hotels. Trina would be married the following\nevening, and immediately after the wedding supper the Sieppes would\nleave for the South.\n\nMcTeague spent the day in a fever of agitation, frightened out of his\nwits each time that Old Grannis left his elbow.\n\nOld Grannis was delighted beyond measure at the prospect of acting the\npart of best man in the ceremony. This wedding in which he was to figure\nfilled his mind with vague ideas and half-formed thoughts. He found\nhimself continually wondering what Miss Baker would think of it. During\nall that day he was in a reflective mood.\n\n\"Marriage is a--a noble institution, is it not, Doctor?\" he observed\nto McTeague. \"The--the foundation of society. It is not good that man\nshould be alone. No, no,\" he added, pensively, \"it is not good.\"\n\n\"Huh? Yes, yes,\" McTeague answered, his eyes in the air, hardly hearing\nhim. \"Do you think the rooms are all right? Let's go in and look at them\nagain.\"\n\nThey went down the hall to where the new rooms were situated, and the\ndentist inspected them for the twentieth time.\n\nThe rooms were three in number--first, the sitting-room, which was also\nthe dining-room; then the bedroom, and back of this the tiny kitchen.\n\nThe sitting-room was particularly charming. Clean matting covered the\nfloor, and two or three bright colored rugs were scattered here and\nthere. The backs of the chairs were hung with knitted worsted tidies,\nvery gay. The bay window should have been occupied by Trina's sewing\nmachine, but this had been moved to the other side of the room to give\nplace to a little black walnut table with spiral legs, before which\nthe pair were to be married. In one corner stood the parlor melodeon, a\nfamily possession of the Sieppes, but given now to Trina as one of her\nparents' wedding presents. Three pictures hung upon the walls. Two were\ncompanion pieces. One of these represented a little boy wearing huge\nspectacles and trying to smoke an enormous pipe. This was called \"I'm\nGrandpa,\" the title being printed in large black letters; the companion\npicture was entitled \"I'm Grandma,\" a little girl in cap and \"specs,\"\nwearing mitts, and knitting. These pictures were hung on either side of\nthe mantelpiece. The other picture was quite an affair, very large and\nstriking. It was a colored lithograph of two little golden-haired girls\nin their nightgowns. They were kneeling down and saying their prayers;\ntheir eyes--very large and very blue--rolled upward. This picture had\nfor name, \"Faith,\" and was bordered with a red plush mat and a frame of\nimitation beaten brass.\n\nA door hung with chenille portieres--a bargain at two dollars and a\nhalf--admitted one to the bedroom. The bedroom could boast a carpet,\nthree-ply ingrain, the design being bunches of red and green flowers in\nyellow baskets on a white ground. The wall-paper was admirable--hundreds\nand hundreds of tiny Japanese mandarins, all identically alike, helping\nhundreds of almond-eyed ladies into hundreds of impossible junks,\nwhile hundreds of bamboo palms overshadowed the pair, and hundreds of\nlong-legged storks trailed contemptuously away from the scene. This room\nwas prolific in pictures. Most of them were framed colored prints from\nChristmas editions of the London \"Graphic\" and \"Illustrated News,\" the\nsubject of each picture inevitably involving very alert fox terriers and\nvery pretty moon-faced little girls.\n\nBack of the bedroom was the kitchen, a creation of Trina's, a dream of\na kitchen, with its range, its porcelain-lined sink, its copper boiler,\nand its overpowering array of flashing tinware. Everything was new;\neverything was complete.\n\nMaria Macapa and a waiter from one of the restaurants in the street\nwere to prepare the wedding supper here. Maria had already put in an\nappearance. The fire was crackling in the new stove, that smoked badly;\na smell of cooking was in the air. She drove McTeague and Old Grannis\nfrom the room with great gestures of her bare arms.\n\nThis kitchen was the only one of the three rooms they had been obliged\nto furnish throughout. Most of the sitting-room and bedroom furniture\nwent with the suite; a few pieces they had bought; the remainder Trina\nhad brought over from the B Street house.\n\nThe presents had been set out on the extension table in the\nsitting-room. Besides the parlor melodeon, Trina's parents had given her\nan ice-water set, and a carving knife and fork with elk-horn handles.\nSelina had painted a view of the Golden Gate upon a polished slice\nof redwood that answered the purposes of a paper weight. Marcus\nSchouler--after impressing upon Trina that his gift was to HER, and\nnot to McTeague--had sent a chatelaine watch of German silver; Uncle\nOelbermann's present, however, had been awaited with a good deal of\ncuriosity. What would he send? He was very rich; in a sense Trina was\nhis protege. A couple of days before that upon which the wedding was\nto take place, two boxes arrived with his card. Trina and McTeague,\nassisted by Old Grannis, had opened them. The first was a box of all\nsorts of toys.\n\n\"But what--what--I don't make it out,\" McTeague had exclaimed. \"Why\nshould he send us toys? We have no need of toys.\" Scarlet to her\nhair, Trina dropped into a chair and laughed till she cried behind her\nhandkerchief.\n\n\"We've no use of toys,\" muttered McTeague, looking at her in perplexity.\nOld Grannis smiled discreetly, raising a tremulous hand to his chin.\n\nThe other box was heavy, bound with withes at the edges, the letters and\nstamps burnt in.\n\n\"I think--I really think it's champagne,\" said Old Grannis in a whisper.\nSo it was. A full case of Monopole. What a wonder! None of them had seen\nthe like before. Ah, this Uncle Oelbermann! That's what it was to be\nrich. Not one of the other presents produced so deep an impression as\nthis.\n\nAfter Old Grannis and the dentist had gone through the rooms, giving\na last look around to see that everything was ready, they returned to\nMcTeague's \"Parlors.\" At the door Old Grannis excused himself.\n\nAt four o'clock McTeague began to dress, shaving himself first before\nthe hand-glass that was hung against the woodwork of the bay window.\nWhile he shaved he sang with strange inappropriateness:\n\n     \"No one to love, none to Caress,\n     Left all alone in this world's wilderness.\"\n\nBut as he stood before the mirror, intent upon his shaving, there came a\nroll of wheels over the cobbles in front of the house. He rushed to the\nwindow. Trina had arrived with her father and mother. He saw her get\nout, and as she glanced upward at his window, their eyes met.\n\nAh, there she was. There she was, his little woman, looking up at him,\nher adorable little chin thrust upward with that familiar movement of\ninnocence and confidence. The dentist saw again, as if for the first\ntime, her small, pale face looking out from beneath her royal tiara of\nblack hair; he saw again her long, narrow blue eyes; her lips, nose, and\ntiny ears, pale and bloodless, and suggestive of anaemia, as if all the\nvitality that should have lent them color had been sucked up into the\nstrands and coils of that wonderful hair.\n\nAs their eyes met they waved their hands gayly to each other; then\nMcTeague heard Trina and her mother come up the stairs and go into the\nbedroom of the photographer's suite, where Trina was to dress.\n\nNo, no; surely there could be no longer any hesitation. He knew that he\nloved her. What was the matter with him, that he should have doubted\nit for an instant? The great difficulty was that she was too good, too\nadorable, too sweet, too delicate for him, who was so huge, so clumsy,\nso brutal.\n\nThere was a knock at the door. It was Old Grannis. He was dressed in\nhis one black suit of broadcloth, much wrinkled; his hair was carefully\nbrushed over his bald forehead.\n\n\"Miss Trina has come,\" he announced, \"and the minister. You have an hour\nyet.\"\n\nThe dentist finished dressing. He wore a suit bought for the occasion--a\nready made \"Prince Albert\" coat too short in the sleeves, striped\n\"blue\" trousers, and new patent leather shoes--veritable instruments of\ntorture. Around his collar was a wonderful necktie that Trina had given\nhim; it was of salmon-pink satin; in its centre Selina had painted a\nknot of blue forget-me-nots.\n\nAt length, after an interminable period of waiting, Mr. Sieppe appeared\nat the door.\n\n\"Are you reatty?\" he asked in a sepulchral whisper. \"Gome, den.\" It was\nlike King Charles summoned to execution. Mr. Sieppe preceded them\ninto the hall, moving at a funereal pace. He paused. Suddenly, in the\ndirection of the sitting-room, came the strains of the parlor melodeon.\nMr. Sieppe flung his arm in the air.\n\n\"Vowaarts!\" he cried.\n\nHe left them at the door of the sitting-room, he himself going into the\nbedroom where Trina was waiting, entering by the hall door. He was in\na tremendous state of nervous tension, fearful lest something should go\nwrong. He had employed the period of waiting in going through his part\nfor the fiftieth time, repeating what he had to say in a low voice. He\nhad even made chalk marks on the matting in the places where he was to\ntake positions.\n\nThe dentist and Old Grannis entered the sitting-room; the minister stood\nbehind the little table in the bay window, holding a book, one finger\nmarking the place; he was rigid, erect, impassive. On either side of\nhim, in a semi-circle, stood the invited guests. A little pock-marked\ngentleman in glasses, no doubt the famous Uncle Oelbermann; Miss Baker,\nin her black grenadine, false curls, and coral brooch; Marcus\nSchouler, his arms folded, his brows bent, grand and gloomy; Heise the\nharness-maker, in yellow gloves, intently studying the pattern of the\nmatting; and Owgooste, in his Fauntleroy \"costume,\" stupefied and a\nlittle frightened, rolling his eyes from face to face. Selina sat at\nthe parlor melodeon, fingering the keys, her glance wandering to the\nchenille portieres. She stopped playing as McTeague and Old Grannis\nentered and took their places. A profound silence ensued. Uncle\nOelbermann's shirt front could be heard creaking as he breathed. The\nmost solemn expression pervaded every face.\n\nAll at once the portieres were shaken violently. It was a signal. Selina\npulled open the stops and swung into the wedding march.\n\nTrina entered. She was dressed in white silk, a crown of orange blossoms\nwas around her swarthy hair--dressed high for the first time--her veil\nreached to the floor. Her face was pink, but otherwise she was calm.\nShe looked quietly around the room as she crossed it, until her glance\nrested on McTeague, smiling at him then very prettily and with perfect\nself-possession.\n\nShe was on her father's arm. The twins, dressed exactly alike, walked\nin front, each carrying an enormous bouquet of cut flowers in a\n\"lace-paper\" holder. Mrs. Sieppe followed in the rear. She was crying;\nher handkerchief was rolled into a wad. From time to time she looked\nat the train of Trina's dress through her tears. Mr. Sieppe marched his\ndaughter to the exact middle of the floor, wheeled at right angles, and\nbrought her up to the minister. He stepped back three paces, and\nstood planted upon one of his chalk marks, his face glistening with\nperspiration.\n\nThen Trina and the dentist were married. The guests stood in constrained\nattitudes, looking furtively out of the corners of their eyes. Mr.\nSieppe never moved a muscle; Mrs. Sieppe cried into her handkerchief\nall the time. At the melodeon Selina played \"Call Me Thine Own,\" very\nsoftly, the tremulo stop pulled out. She looked over her shoulder from\ntime to time. Between the pauses of the music one could hear the low\ntones of the minister, the responses of the participants, and the\nsuppressed sounds of Mrs. Sieppe's weeping. Outside the noises of the\nstreet rose to the windows in muffled undertones, a cable car rumbled\npast, a newsboy went by chanting the evening papers; from somewhere in\nthe building itself came a persistent noise of sawing.\n\nTrina and McTeague knelt. The dentist's knees thudded on the floor and\nhe presented to view the soles of his shoes, painfully new and unworn,\nthe leather still yellow, the brass nail heads still glittering. Trina\nsank at his side very gracefully, setting her dress and train with a\nlittle gesture of her free hand. The company bowed their heads, Mr.\nSieppe shutting his eyes tight. But Mrs. Sieppe took advantage of\nthe moment to stop crying and make furtive gestures towards Owgooste,\nsigning him to pull down his coat. But Owgooste gave no heed; his eyes\nwere starting from their sockets, his chin had dropped upon his lace\ncollar, and his head turned vaguely from side to side with a continued\nand maniacal motion.\n\nAll at once the ceremony was over before any one expected it. The guests\nkept their positions for a moment, eyeing one another, each fearing to\nmake the first move, not quite certain as to whether or not everything\nwere finished. But the couple faced the room, Trina throwing back her\nveil. She--perhaps McTeague as well--felt that there was a certain\ninadequateness about the ceremony. Was that all there was to it? Did\njust those few muttered phrases make them man and wife? It had been over\nin a few moments, but it had bound them for life. Had not something\nbeen left out? Was not the whole affair cursory, superficial? It was\ndisappointing.\n\nBut Trina had no time to dwell upon this. Marcus Schouler, in the manner\nof a man of the world, who knew how to act in every situation, stepped\nforward and, even before Mr. or Mrs. Sieppe, took Trina's hand.\n\n\"Let me be the first to congratulate Mrs. McTeague,\" he said, feeling\nvery noble and heroic. The strain of the previous moments was relaxed\nimmediately, the guests crowded around the pair, shaking hands--a babel\nof talk arose.\n\n\"Owgooste, WILL you pull down your goat, den?\"\n\n\"Well, my dear, now you're married and happy. When I first saw you two\ntogether, I said, 'What a pair!' We're to be neighbors now; you must\ncome up and see me very often and we'll have tea together.\"\n\n\"Did you hear that sawing going on all the time? I declare it regularly\ngot on my nerves.\"\n\nTrina kissed her father and mother, crying a little herself as she saw\nthe tears in Mrs. Sieppe's eyes.\n\nMarcus came forward a second time, and, with an air of great gravity,\nkissed his cousin upon the forehead. Heise was introduced to Trina and\nUncle Oelbermann to the dentist.\n\nFor upwards of half an hour the guests stood about in groups, filling\nthe little sitting-room with a great chatter of talk. Then it was time\nto make ready for supper.\n\nThis was a tremendous task, in which nearly all the guests were obliged\nto assist. The sitting-room was transformed into a dining-room. The\npresents were removed from the extension table and the table drawn out\nto its full length. The cloth was laid, the chairs--rented from the\ndancing academy hard by--drawn up, the dishes set out, and the two\nbouquets of cut flowers taken from the twins under their shrill\nprotests, and \"arranged\" in vases at either end of the table.\n\nThere was a great coming and going between the kitchen and the\nsitting-room. Trina, who was allowed to do nothing, sat in the bay\nwindow and fretted, calling to her mother from time to time:\n\n\"The napkins are in the right-hand drawer of the pantry.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I got um. Where do you geep der zoup blates?\"\n\n\"The soup plates are here already.\"\n\n\"Say, Cousin Trina, is there a corkscrew? What is home without a\ncorkscrew?\"\n\n\"In the kitchen-table drawer, in the left-hand corner.\"\n\n\"Are these the forks you want to use, Mrs. McTeague?\"\n\n\"No, no, there's some silver forks. Mamma knows where.\"\n\nThey were all very gay, laughing over their mistakes, getting in one\nanother's way, rushing into the sitting-room, their hands full of plates\nor knives or glasses, and darting out again after more. Marcus and Mr.\nSieppe took their coats off. Old Grannis and Miss Baker passed each\nother in the hall in a constrained silence, her grenadine brushing\nagainst the elbow of his wrinkled frock coat. Uncle Oelbermann\nsuperintended Heise opening the case of champagne with the gravity of a\nmagistrate. Owgooste was assigned the task of filling the new salt and\npepper canisters of red and blue glass.\n\nIn a wonderfully short time everything was ready. Marcus Schouler\nresumed his coat, wiping his forehead, and remarking:\n\n\"I tell you, I've been doing CHORES for MY board.\"\n\n\"To der table!\" commanded Mr. Sieppe.\n\nThe company sat down with a great clatter, Trina at the foot, the\ndentist at the head, the others arranged themselves in haphazard\nfashion. But it happened that Marcus Schouler crowded into the seat\nbeside Selina, towards which Old Grannis was directing himself. There\nwas but one other chair vacant, and that at the side of Miss Baker. Old\nGrannis hesitated, putting his hand to his chin. However, there was no\nescape. In great trepidation he sat down beside the retired dressmaker.\nNeither of them spoke. Old Grannis dared not move, but sat rigid, his\neyes riveted on his empty soup plate.\n\nAll at once there was a report like a pistol. The men started in their\nplaces. Mrs. Sieppe uttered a muffled shriek. The waiter from the cheap\nrestaurant, hired as Maria's assistant, rose from a bending posture, a\nchampagne bottle frothing in his hand; he was grinning from ear to ear.\n\n\"Don't get scairt,\" he said, reassuringly, \"it ain't loaded.\"\n\nWhen all their glasses had been filled, Marcus proposed the health of\nthe bride, \"standing up.\" The guests rose and drank. Hardly one of them\nhad ever tasted champagne before. The moment's silence after the toast\nwas broken by McTeague exclaiming with a long breath of satisfaction:\n\"That's the best beer I ever drank.\"\n\nThere was a roar of laughter. Especially was Marcus tickled over the\ndentist's blunder; he went off in a very spasm of mirth, banging the\ntable with his fist, laughing until his eyes watered. All through the\nmeal he kept breaking out into cackling imitations of McTeague's words:\n\"That's the best BEER I ever drank. Oh, Lord, ain't that a break!\"\n\nWhat a wonderful supper that was! There was oyster soup; there were\nsea bass and barracuda; there was a gigantic roast goose stuffed with\nchestnuts; there were egg-plant and sweet potatoes--Miss Baker called\nthem \"yams.\" There was calf's head in oil, over which Mr. Sieppe went\ninto ecstasies; there was lobster salad; there were rice pudding, and\nstrawberry ice cream, and wine jelly, and stewed prunes, and cocoanuts,\nand mixed nuts, and raisins, and fruit, and tea, and coffee, and mineral\nwaters, and lemonade.\n\nFor two hours the guests ate; their faces red, their elbows wide, the\nperspiration beading their foreheads. All around the table one saw the\nsame incessant movement of jaws and heard the same uninterrupted sound\nof chewing. Three times Heise passed his plate for more roast goose.\nMr. Sieppe devoured the calf's head with long breaths of contentment;\nMcTeague ate for the sake of eating, without choice; everything within\nreach of his hands found its way into his enormous mouth.\n\nThere was but little conversation, and that only of the food; one\nexchanged opinions with one's neighbor as to the soup, the egg-plant,\nor the stewed prunes. Soon the room became very warm, a faint moisture\nappeared upon the windows, the air was heavy with the smell of cooked\nfood. At every moment Trina or Mrs. Sieppe urged some one of the company\nto have his or her plate refilled. They were constantly employed in\ndishing potatoes or carving the goose or ladling gravy. The hired waiter\ncircled around the room, his limp napkin over his arm, his hands full\nof plates and dishes. He was a great joker; he had names of his own\nfor different articles of food, that sent gales of laughter around the\ntable. When he spoke of a bunch of parsley as \"scenery,\" Heise all but\nstrangled himself over a mouthful of potato. Out in the kitchen Maria\nMacapa did the work of three, her face scarlet, her sleeves rolled\nup; every now and then she uttered shrill but unintelligible outcries,\nsupposedly addressed to the waiter.\n\n\"Uncle Oelbermann,\" said Trina, \"let me give you another helping of\nprunes.\"\n\nThe Sieppes paid great deference to Uncle Oelbermann, as indeed did the\nwhole company. Even Marcus Schouler lowered his voice when he addressed\nhim. At the beginning of the meal he had nudged the harness-maker and\nhad whispered behind his hand, nodding his head toward the wholesale toy\ndealer, \"Got thirty thousand dollars in the bank; has, for a fact.\"\n\n\"Don't have much to say,\" observed Heise.\n\n\"No, no. That's his way; never opens his face.\"\n\nAs the evening wore on, the gas and two lamps were lit. The company were\nstill eating. The men, gorged with food, had unbuttoned their vests.\nMcTeague's cheeks were distended, his eyes wide, his huge, salient jaw\nmoved with a machine-like regularity; at intervals he drew a series of\nshort breaths through his nose. Mrs. Sieppe wiped her forehead with her\nnapkin.\n\n\"Hey, dere, poy, gif me some more oaf dat--what you\ncall--'bubble-water.'\"\n\nThat was how the waiter had spoken of the champagne--\"bubble-water.\"\nThe guests had shouted applause, \"Outa sight.\" He was a heavy josher was\nthat waiter.\n\nBottle after bottle was opened, the women stopping their ears as the\ncorks were drawn. All of a sudden the dentist uttered an exclamation,\nclapping his hand to his nose, his face twisting sharply.\n\n\"Mac, what is it?\" cried Trina in alarm.\n\n\"That champagne came to my nose,\" he cried, his eyes watering. \"It\nstings like everything.\"\n\n\"Great BEER, ain't ut?\" shouted Marcus.\n\n\"Now, Mark,\" remonstrated Trina in a low voice. \"Now, Mark, you just\nshut up; that isn't funny any more. I don't want you should make fun of\nMac. He called it beer on purpose. I guess HE knows.\"\n\nThroughout the meal old Miss Baker had occupied herself largely with\nOwgooste and the twins, who had been given a table by themselves--the\nblack walnut table before which the ceremony had taken place. The little\ndressmaker was continually turning about in her place, inquiring of the\nchildren if they wanted for anything; inquiries they rarely answered\nother than by stare, fixed, ox-like, expressionless.\n\nSuddenly the little dressmaker turned to Old Grannis and exclaimed:\n\n\"I'm so very fond of little children.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, they're very interesting. I'm very fond of them, too.\"\n\nThe next instant both of the old people were overwhelmed with confusion.\nWhat! They had spoken to each other after all these years of silence;\nthey had for the first time addressed remarks to each other.\n\nThe old dressmaker was in a torment of embarrassment. How was it she had\ncome to speak? She had neither planned nor wished it. Suddenly the words\nhad escaped her, he had answered, and it was all over--over before they\nknew it.\n\nOld Grannis's fingers trembled on the table ledge, his heart beat\nheavily, his breath fell short. He had actually talked to the little\ndressmaker. That possibility to which he had looked forward, it\nseemed to him for years--that companionship, that intimacy with his\nfellow-lodger, that delightful acquaintance which was only to ripen at\nsome far distant time, he could not exactly say when--behold, it had\nsuddenly come to a head, here in this over-crowded, over-heated room,\nin the midst of all this feeding, surrounded by odors of hot dishes,\naccompanied by the sounds of incessant mastication. How different he had\nimagined it would be! They were to be alone--he and Miss Baker--in the\nevening somewhere, withdrawn from the world, very quiet, very calm and\npeaceful. Their talk was to be of their lives, their lost illusions, not\nof other people's children.\n\nThe two old people did not speak again. They sat there side by side,\nnearer than they had ever been before, motionless, abstracted; their\nthoughts far away from that scene of feasting. They were thinking of\neach other and they were conscious of it. Timid, with the timidity of\ntheir second childhood, constrained and embarrassed by each other's\npresence, they were, nevertheless, in a little Elysium of their own\ncreating. They walked hand in hand in a delicious garden where it was\nalways autumn; together and alone they entered upon the long retarded\nromance of their commonplace and uneventful lives.\n\nAt last that great supper was over, everything had been eaten; the\nenormous roast goose had dwindled to a very skeleton. Mr. Sieppe had\nreduced the calf's head to a mere skull; a row of empty champagne\nbottles--\"dead soldiers,\" as the facetious waiter had called them--lined\nthe mantelpiece. Nothing of the stewed prunes remained but the juice,\nwhich was given to Owgooste and the twins. The platters were as clean as\nif they had been washed; crumbs of bread, potato parings, nutshells, and\nbits of cake littered the table; coffee and ice-cream stains and\nspots of congealed gravy marked the position of each plate. It was\na devastation, a pillage; the table presented the appearance of an\nabandoned battlefield.\n\n\"Ouf,\" cried Mrs. Sieppe, pushing back, \"I haf eatun und eatun, ach,\nGott, how I haf eatun!\"\n\n\"Ah, dot kaf's het,\" murmured her husband, passing his tongue over his\nlips.\n\nThe facetious waiter had disappeared. He and Maria Macapa foregathered\nin the kitchen. They drew up to the washboard of the sink, feasting off\nthe remnants of the supper, slices of goose, the remains of the lobster\nsalad, and half a bottle of champagne. They were obliged to drink the\nlatter from teacups.\n\n\"Here's how,\" said the waiter gallantly, as he raised his tea-cup,\nbowing to Maria across the sink. \"Hark,\" he added, \"they're singing\ninside.\"\n\nThe company had left the table and had assembled about the melodeon,\nwhere Selina was seated. At first they attempted some of the popular\nsongs of the day, but were obliged to give over as none of them knew any\nof the words beyond the first line of the chorus. Finally they pitched\nupon \"Nearer, My God, to Thee,\" as the only song which they all knew.\nSelina sang the \"alto,\" very much off the key; Marcus intoned the bass,\nscowling fiercely, his chin drawn into his collar. They sang in very\nslow time. The song became a dirge, a lamentable, prolonged wail of\ndistress:\n\n     \"Nee-rah, my Gahd, to Thee,\n     Nee-rah to Thee-ah.\"\n\nAt the end of the song, Uncle Oelbermann put on his hat without a word\nof warning. Instantly there was a hush. The guests rose.\n\n\"Not going so soon, Uncle Oelbermann?\" protested Trina, politely. He\nonly nodded. Marcus sprang forward to help him with his overcoat. Mr.\nSieppe came up and the two men shook hands.\n\nThen Uncle Oelbermann delivered himself of an oracular phrase. No doubt\nhe had been meditating it during the supper. Addressing Mr. Sieppe, he\nsaid:\n\n\"You have not lost a daughter, but have gained a son.\"\n\nThese were the only words he had spoken the entire evening. He departed;\nthe company was profoundly impressed.\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, when Marcus Schouler was entertaining the\nguests by eating almonds, shells and all, Mr. Sieppe started to his\nfeet, watch in hand.\n\n\"Haf-bast elevun,\" he shouted. \"Attention! Der dime haf arrive, shtop\neferyting. We depart.\"\n\nThis was a signal for tremendous confusion. Mr. Sieppe immediately threw\noff his previous air of relaxation, the calf's head was forgotten, he\nwas once again the leader of vast enterprises.\n\n\"To me, to me,\" he cried. \"Mommer, der tervins, Owgooste.\" He marshalled\nhis tribe together, with tremendous commanding gestures. The sleeping\ntwins were suddenly shaken into a dazed consciousness; Owgooste, whom\nthe almond-eating of Marcus Schouler had petrified with admiration, was\nsmacked to a realization of his surroundings.\n\nOld Grannis, with a certain delicacy that was one of his\ncharacteristics, felt instinctively that the guests--the mere\noutsiders--should depart before the family began its leave-taking of\nTrina. He withdrew unobtrusively, after a hasty good-night to the bride\nand groom. The rest followed almost immediately.\n\n\"Well, Mr. Sieppe,\" exclaimed Marcus, \"we won't see each other for some\ntime.\" Marcus had given up his first intention of joining in the Sieppe\nmigration. He spoke in a large way of certain affairs that would keep\nhim in San Francisco till the fall. Of late he had entertained ambitions\nof a ranch life, he would breed cattle, he had a little money and was\nonly looking for some one \"to go in with.\" He dreamed of a cowboy's\nlife and saw himself in an entrancing vision involving silver spurs and\nuntamed bronchos. He told himself that Trina had cast him off, that his\nbest friend had \"played him for a sucker,\" that the \"proper caper\" was\nto withdraw from the world entirely.\n\n\"If you hear of anybody down there,\" he went on, speaking to Mr. Sieppe,\n\"that wants to go in for ranching, why just let me know.\"\n\n\"Soh, soh,\" answered Mr. Sieppe abstractedly, peering about for\nOwgooste's cap.\n\nMarcus bade the Sieppes farewell. He and Heise went out together. One\nheard them, as they descended the stairs, discussing the possibility of\nFrenna's place being still open.\n\nThen Miss Baker departed after kissing Trina on both cheeks. Selina went\nwith her. There was only the family left.\n\nTrina watched them go, one by one, with an increasing feeling of\nuneasiness and vague apprehension. Soon they would all be gone.\n\n\"Well, Trina,\" exclaimed Mr. Sieppe, \"goot-py; perhaps you gome visit us\nsomedime.\"\n\nMrs. Sieppe began crying again.\n\n\"Ach, Trina, ven shall I efer see you again?\"\n\nTears came to Trina's eyes in spite of herself. She put her arms around\nher mother.\n\n\"Oh, sometime, sometime,\" she cried. The twins and Owgooste clung to\nTrina's skirts, fretting and whimpering.\n\nMcTeague was miserable. He stood apart from the group, in a corner. None\nof them seemed to think of him; he was not of them.\n\n\"Write to me very often, mamma, and tell me about everything--about\nAugust and the twins.\"\n\n\"It is dime,\" cried Mr. Sieppe, nervously. \"Goot-py, Trina. Mommer,\nOwgooste, say goot-py, den we must go. Goot-py, Trina.\" He kissed\nher. Owgooste and the twins were lifted up. \"Gome, gome,\" insisted Mr.\nSieppe, moving toward the door.\n\n\"Goot-py, Trina,\" exclaimed Mrs. Sieppe, crying harder than ever.\n\"Doktor--where is der doktor--Doktor, pe goot to her, eh? pe vairy goot,\neh, won't you? Zum day, Dokter, you vill haf a daughter, den you know\nberhaps how I feel, yes.\"\n\nThey were standing at the door by this time. Mr. Sieppe, half way down\nthe stairs, kept calling \"Gome, gome, we miss der drain.\"\n\nMrs. Sieppe released Trina and started down the hall, the twins and\nOwgooste following. Trina stood in the doorway, looking after them\nthrough her tears. They were going, going. When would she ever see them\nagain? She was to be left alone with this man to whom she had just been\nmarried. A sudden vague terror seized her; she left McTeague and ran\ndown the hall and caught her mother around the neck.\n\n\"I don't WANT you to go,\" she whispered in her mother's ear, sobbing.\n\"Oh, mamma, I--I'm 'fraid.\"\n\n\"Ach, Trina, you preak my heart. Don't gry, poor leetle girl.\" She\nrocked Trina in her arms as though she were a child again. \"Poor leetle\nscairt girl, don' gry--soh--soh--soh, dere's nuttun to pe 'fraid oaf.\nDere, go to your hoasban'. Listen, popper's galling again; go den;\ngoot-by.\"\n\nShe loosened Trina's arms and started down the stairs. Trina leaned over\nthe banisters, straining her eyes after her mother.\n\n\"What is ut, Trina?\"\n\n\"Oh, good-by, good-by.\"\n\n\"Gome, gome, we miss der drain.\"\n\n\"Mamma, oh, mamma!\"\n\n\"What is ut, Trina?\"\n\n\"Good-by.\"\n\n\"Goot-py, leetle daughter.\"\n\n\"Good-by, good-by, good-by.\"\n\nThe street door closed. The silence was profound.\n\nFor another moment Trina stood leaning over the banisters, looking\ndown into the empty stairway. It was dark. There was nobody. They--her\nfather, her mother, the children--had left her, left her alone. She\nfaced about toward the rooms--faced her husband, faced her new home, the\nnew life that was to begin now.\n\nThe hall was empty and deserted. The great flat around her seemed new\nand huge and strange; she felt horribly alone. Even Maria and the hired\nwaiter were gone. On one of the floors above she heard a baby crying.\nShe stood there an instant in the dark hall, in her wedding finery,\nlooking about her, listening. From the open door of the sitting-room\nstreamed a gold bar of light.\n\nShe went down the hall, by the open door of the sitting-room, going on\ntoward the hall door of the bedroom.\n\nAs she softly passed the sitting-room she glanced hastily in. The lamps\nand the gas were burning brightly, the chairs were pushed back from the\ntable just as the guests had left them, and the table itself, abandoned,\ndeserted, presented to view the vague confusion of its dishes, its\nknives and forks, its empty platters and crumpled napkins. The dentist\nsat there leaning on his elbows, his back toward her; against the white\nblur of the table he looked colossal. Above his giant shoulders rose his\nthick, red neck and mane of yellow hair. The light shone pink through\nthe gristle of his enormous ears.\n\nTrina entered the bedroom, closing the door after her. At the sound, she\nheard McTeague start and rise.\n\n\"Is that you, Trina?\"\n\nShe did not answer; but paused in the middle of the room, holding her\nbreath, trembling.\n\nThe dentist crossed the outside room, parted the chenille portieres,\nand came in. He came toward her quickly, making as if to take her in his\narms. His eyes were alight.\n\n\"No, no,\" cried Trina, shrinking from him. Suddenly seized with the fear\nof him--the intuitive feminine fear of the male--her whole being\nquailed before him. She was terrified at his huge, square-cut head; his\npowerful, salient jaw; his huge, red hands; his enormous, resistless\nstrength.\n\n\"No, no--I'm afraid,\" she cried, drawing back from him to the other side\nof the room.\n\n\"Afraid?\" answered the dentist in perplexity. \"What are you afraid of,\nTrina? I'm not going to hurt you. What are you afraid of?\"\n\nWhat, indeed, was Trina afraid of? She could not tell. But what did she\nknow of McTeague, after all? Who was this man that had come into her\nlife, who had taken her from her home and from her parents, and with\nwhom she was now left alone here in this strange, vast flat?\n\n\"Oh, I'm afraid. I'm afraid,\" she cried.\n\nMcTeague came nearer, sat down beside her and put one arm around her.\n\n\"What are you afraid of, Trina?\" he said, reassuringly. \"I don't want to\nfrighten you.\"\n\nShe looked at him wildly, her adorable little chin quivering, the tears\nbrimming in her narrow blue eyes. Then her glance took on a certain\nintentness, and she peered curiously into his face, saying almost in a\nwhisper:\n\n\"I'm afraid of YOU.\"\n\nBut the dentist did not heed her. An immense joy seized upon him--the\njoy of possession. Trina was his very own now. She lay there in the\nhollow of his arm, helpless and very pretty.\n\nThose instincts that in him were so close to the surface suddenly leaped\nto life, shouting and clamoring, not to be resisted. He loved her. Ah,\ndid he not love her? The smell of her hair, of her neck, rose to him.\n\nSuddenly he caught her in both his huge arms, crushing down her struggle\nwith his immense strength, kissing her full upon the mouth. Then her\ngreat love for McTeague suddenly flashed up in Trina's breast; she gave\nup to him as she had done before, yielding all at once to that strange\ndesire of being conquered and subdued. She clung to him, her hands\nclasped behind his neck, whispering in his ear:\n\n\"Oh, you must be good to me--very, very good to me, dear--for you're all\nthat I have in the world now.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 10\n\n\nThat summer passed, then the winter. The wet season began in the last\ndays of September and continued all through October, November, and\nDecember. At long intervals would come a week of perfect days, the\nsky without a cloud, the air motionless, but touched with a certain\nnimbleness, a faint effervescence that was exhilarating. Then, without\nwarning, during a night when a south wind blew, a gray scroll of cloud\nwould unroll and hang high over the city, and the rain would come\npattering down again, at first in scattered showers, then in an\nuninterrupted drizzle.\n\nAll day long Trina sat in the bay window of the sitting-room that\ncommanded a view of a small section of Polk Street. As often as she\nraised her head she could see the big market, a confectionery store,\na bell-hanger's shop, and, farther on, above the roofs, the glass\nskylights and water tanks of the big public baths. In the nearer\nforeground ran the street itself; the cable cars trundled up and down,\nthumping heavily over the joints of the rails; market carts by the score\ncame and went, driven at a great rate by preoccupied young men in their\nshirt sleeves, with pencils behind their ears, or by reckless boys in\nblood-stained butcher's aprons. Upon the sidewalks the little world of\nPolk Street swarmed and jostled through its daily round of life. On\nfine days the great ladies from the avenue, one block above, invaded\nthe street, appearing before the butcher stalls, intent upon their day's\nmarketing. On rainy days their servants--the Chinese cooks or the second\ngirls--took their places. These servants gave themselves great airs,\ncarrying their big cotton umbrellas as they had seen their mistresses\ncarry their parasols, and haggling in supercilious fashion with the\nmarket men, their chins in the air.\n\nThe rain persisted. Everything in the range of Trina's vision, from the\ntarpaulins on the market-cart horses to the panes of glass in the roof\nof the public baths, looked glazed and varnished. The asphalt of the\nsidewalks shone like the surface of a patent leather boot; every hollow\nin the street held its little puddle, that winked like an eye each time\na drop of rain struck into it.\n\nTrina still continued to work for Uncle Oelbermann. In the mornings she\nbusied herself about the kitchen, the bedroom, and the sitting-room; but\nin the afternoon, for two or three hours after lunch, she was occupied\nwith the Noah's ark animals. She took her work to the bay window,\nspreading out a great square of canvas underneath her chair, to catch\nthe chips and shavings, which she used afterwards for lighting fires.\nOne after another she caught up the little blocks of straight-grained\npine, the knife flashed between her fingers, the little figure grew\nrapidly under her touch, was finished and ready for painting in a\nwonderfully short time, and was tossed into the basket that stood at her\nelbow.\n\nBut very often during that rainy winter after her marriage Trina would\npause in her work, her hands falling idly into her lap, her eyes--her\nnarrow, pale blue eyes--growing wide and thoughtful as she gazed,\nunseeing, out into the rain-washed street.\n\nShe loved McTeague now with a blind, unreasoning love that admitted of\nno doubt or hesitancy. Indeed, it seemed to her that it was only AFTER\nher marriage with the dentist that she had really begun to love him.\nWith the absolute final surrender of herself, the irrevocable, ultimate\nsubmission, had come an affection the like of which she had never\ndreamed in the old B Street days. But Trina loved her husband, not\nbecause she fancied she saw in him any of those noble and generous\nqualities that inspire affection. The dentist might or might not possess\nthem, it was all one with Trina. She loved him because she had given\nherself to him freely, unreservedly; had merged her individuality into\nhis; she was his, she belonged to him forever and forever. Nothing that\nhe could do (so she told herself), nothing that she herself could do,\ncould change her in this respect. McTeague might cease to love her,\nmight leave her, might even die; it would be all the same, SHE WAS HIS.\n\nBut it had not been so at first. During those long, rainy days of the\nfall, days when Trina was left alone for hours, at that time when the\nexcitement and novelty of the honeymoon were dying down, when the new\nhousehold was settling into its grooves, she passed through many an hour\nof misgiving, of doubt, and even of actual regret.\n\nNever would she forget one Sunday afternoon in particular. She had been\nmarried but three weeks. After dinner she and little Miss Baker had gone\nfor a bit of a walk to take advantage of an hour's sunshine and to look\nat some wonderful geraniums in a florist's window on Sutter Street. They\nhad been caught in a shower, and on returning to the flat the little\ndressmaker had insisted on fetching Trina up to her tiny room and\nbrewing her a cup of strong tea, \"to take the chill off.\" The two women\nhad chatted over their teacups the better part of the afternoon, then\nTrina had returned to her rooms. For nearly three hours McTeague had\nbeen out of her thoughts, and as she came through their little\nsuite, singing softly to herself, she suddenly came upon him quite\nunexpectedly. Her husband was in the \"Dental Parlors,\" lying back in his\noperating chair, fast asleep. The little stove was crammed with coke,\nthe room was overheated, the air thick and foul with the odors of ether,\nof coke gas, of stale beer and cheap tobacco. The dentist sprawled his\ngigantic limbs over the worn velvet of the operating chair; his coat and\nvest and shoes were off, and his huge feet, in their thick gray socks,\ndangled over the edge of the foot-rest; his pipe, fallen from his\nhalf-open mouth, had spilled the ashes into his lap; while on the floor,\nat his side stood the half-empty pitcher of steam beer. His head had\nrolled limply upon one shoulder, his face was red with sleep, and from\nhis open mouth came a terrific sound of snoring.\n\nFor a moment Trina stood looking at him as he lay thus, prone, inert,\nhalf-dressed, and stupefied with the heat of the room, the steam beer,\nand the fumes of the cheap tobacco. Then her little chin quivered and a\nsob rose to her throat; she fled from the \"Parlors,\" and locking herself\nin her bedroom, flung herself on the bed and burst into an agony of\nweeping. Ah, no, ah, no, she could not love him. It had all been a\ndreadful mistake, and now it was irrevocable; she was bound to this\nman for life. If it was as bad as this now, only three weeks after her\nmarriage, how would it be in the years to come? Year after year, month\nafter month, hour after hour, she was to see this same face, with its\nsalient jaw, was to feel the touch of those enormous red hands, was\nto hear the heavy, elephantine tread of those huge feet--in thick gray\nsocks. Year after year, day after day, there would be no change, and\nit would last all her life. Either it would be one long continued\nrevulsion, or else--worse than all--she would come to be content with\nhim, would come to be like him, would sink to the level of steam beer\nand cheap tobacco, and all her pretty ways, her clean, trim little\nhabits, would be forgotten, since they would be thrown away upon\nher stupid, brutish husband. \"Her husband!\" THAT, was her husband\nin there--she could yet hear his snores--for life, for life. A great\ndespair seized upon her. She buried her face in the pillow and thought\nof her mother with an infinite longing.\n\nAroused at length by the chittering of the canary, McTeague had awakened\nslowly. After a while he had taken down his concertina and played upon\nit the six very mournful airs that he knew.\n\nFace downward upon the bed, Trina still wept. Throughout that little\nsuite could be heard but two sounds, the lugubrious strains of the\nconcertina and the noise of stifled weeping.\n\nThat her husband should be ignorant of her distress seemed to Trina an\nadditional grievance. With perverse inconsistency she began to wish\nhim to come to her, to comfort her. He ought to know that she was in\ntrouble, that she was lonely and unhappy.\n\n\"Oh, Mac,\" she called in a trembling voice. But the concertina still\ncontinued to wail and lament. Then Trina wished she were dead, and\non the instant jumped up and ran into the \"Dental Parlors,\" and threw\nherself into her husband's arms, crying: \"Oh, Mac, dear, love me, love\nme big! I'm so unhappy.\"\n\n\"What--what--what--\" the dentist exclaimed, starting up bewildered, a\nlittle frightened.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing, only LOVE me, love me always and always.\"\n\nBut this first crisis, this momentary revolt, as much a matter of\nhigh-strung feminine nerves as of anything else, passed, and in the end\nTrina's affection for her \"old bear\" grew in spite of herself. She began\nto love him more and more, not for what he was, but for what she had\ngiven up to him. Only once again did Trina undergo a reaction against\nher husband, and then it was but the matter of an instant, brought\non, curiously enough, by the sight of a bit of egg on McTeague's heavy\nmustache one morning just after breakfast.\n\nThen, too, the pair had learned to make concessions, little by little,\nand all unconsciously they adapted their modes of life to suit each\nother. Instead of sinking to McTeague's level as she had feared, Trina\nfound that she could make McTeague rise to hers, and in this saw a\nsolution of many a difficult and gloomy complication.\n\nFor one thing, the dentist began to dress a little better, Trina even\nsucceeding in inducing him to wear a high silk hat and a frock coat of\na Sunday. Next he relinquished his Sunday afternoon's nap and beer in\nfavor of three or four hours spent in the park with her--the weather\npermitting. So that gradually Trina's misgivings ceased, or when\nthey did assail her, she could at last meet them with a shrug of the\nshoulders, saying to herself meanwhile, \"Well, it's done now and it\ncan't be helped; one must make the best of it.\"\n\nDuring the first months of their married life these nervous relapses of\nhers had alternated with brusque outbursts of affection when her only\nfear was that her husband's love did not equal her own. Without an\ninstant's warning, she would clasp him about the neck, rubbing her cheek\nagainst his, murmuring:\n\n\"Dear old Mac, I love you so, I love you so. Oh, aren't we happy\ntogether, Mac, just us two and no one else? You love me as much as I\nlove you, don't you, Mac? Oh, if you shouldn't--if you SHOULDN'T.\"\n\nBut by the middle of the winter Trina's emotions, oscillating at first\nfrom one extreme to another, commenced to settle themselves to an\nequilibrium of calmness and placid quietude. Her household duties\nbegan more and more to absorb her attention, for she was an admirable\nhousekeeper, keeping the little suite in marvellous good order and\nregulating the schedule of expenditure with an economy that often\nbordered on positive niggardliness. It was a passion with her to save\nmoney. In the bottom of her trunk, in the bedroom, she hid a brass\nmatch-safe that answered the purposes of a savings bank. Each time she\nadded a quarter or a half dollar to the little store she laughed and\nsang with a veritable childish delight; whereas, if the butcher or\nmilkman compelled her to pay an overcharge she was unhappy for the rest\nof the day. She did not save this money for any ulterior purpose, she\nhoarded instinctively, without knowing why, responding to the dentist's\nremonstrances with:\n\n\"Yes, yes, I know I'm a little miser, I know it.\"\n\nTrina had always been an economical little body, but it was only\nsince her great winning in the lottery that she had become especially\npenurious. No doubt, in her fear lest their great good luck should\ndemoralize them and lead to habits of extravagance, she had recoiled too\nfar in the other direction. Never, never, never should a penny of that\nmiraculous fortune be spent; rather should it be added to. It was a nest\negg, a monstrous, roc-like nest egg, not so large, however, but that it\ncould be made larger. Already by the end of that winter Trina had begun\nto make up the deficit of two hundred dollars that she had been forced\nto expend on the preparations for her marriage.\n\nMcTeague, on his part, never asked himself now-a-days whether he loved\nTrina the wife as much as he had loved Trina the young girl. There had\nbeen a time when to kiss Trina, to take her in his arms, had thrilled\nhim from head to heel with a happiness that was beyond words; even the\nsmell of her wonderful odorous hair had sent a sensation of faintness\nall through him. That time was long past now. Those sudden outbursts of\naffection on the part of his little woman, outbursts that only increased\nin vehemence the longer they lived together, puzzled rather than\npleased him. He had come to submit to them good-naturedly, answering\nher passionate inquiries with a \"Sure, sure, Trina, sure I love you.\nWhat--what's the matter with you?\"\n\nThere was no passion in the dentist's regard for his wife. He dearly\nliked to have her near him, he took an enormous pleasure in watching her\nas she moved about their rooms, very much at home, gay and singing from\nmorning till night; and it was his great delight to call her into the\n\"Dental Parlors\" when a patient was in the chair and, while he held the\nplugger, to have her rap in the gold fillings with the little box-wood\nmallet as he had taught her. But that tempest of passion, that\noverpowering desire that had suddenly taken possession of him that day\nwhen he had given her ether, again when he had caught her in his arms in\nthe B Street station, and again and again during the early days of their\nmarried life, rarely stirred him now. On the other hand, he was never\nassailed with doubts as to the wisdom of his marriage.\n\nMcTeague had relapsed to his wonted stolidity. He never questioned\nhimself, never looked for motives, never went to the bottom of things.\nThe year following upon the summer of his marriage was a time of great\ncontentment for him; after the novelty of the honeymoon had passed he\nslipped easily into the new order of things without a question. Thus\nhis life would be for years to come. Trina was there; he was married and\nsettled. He accepted the situation. The little animal comforts which for\nhim constituted the enjoyment of life were ministered to at every\nturn, or when they were interfered with--as in the case of his Sunday\nafternoon's nap and beer--some agreeable substitute was found. In her\nattempts to improve McTeague--to raise him from the stupid animal life\nto which he had been accustomed in his bachelor days--Trina was tactful\nenough to move so cautiously and with such slowness that the dentist\nwas unconscious of any process of change. In the matter of the high silk\nhat, it seemed to him that the initiative had come from himself.\n\nGradually the dentist improved under the influence of his little wife.\nHe no longer went abroad with frayed cuffs about his huge red wrists--or\nworse, without any cuffs at all. Trina kept his linen clean and mended,\ndoing most of his washing herself, and insisting that he should\nchange his flannels--thick red flannels they were, with enormous bone\nbuttons--once a week, his linen shirts twice a week, and his collars and\ncuffs every second day. She broke him of the habit of eating with his\nknife, she caused him to substitute bottled beer in the place of steam\nbeer, and she induced him to take off his hat to Miss Baker, to Heise's\nwife, and to the other women of his acquaintance. McTeague no longer\nspent an evening at Frenna's. Instead of this he brought a couple\nof bottles of beer up to the rooms and shared it with Trina. In his\n\"Parlors\" he was no longer gruff and indifferent to his female patients;\nhe arrived at that stage where he could work and talk to them at the\nsame time; he even accompanied them to the door, and held it open for\nthem when the operation was finished, bowing them out with great nods of\nhis huge square-cut head.\n\nBesides all this, he began to observe the broader, larger interests of\nlife, interests that affected him not as an individual, but as a member\nof a class, a profession, or a political party. He read the papers, he\nsubscribed to a dental magazine; on Easter, Christmas, and New Year's\nhe went to church with Trina. He commenced to have opinions,\nconvictions--it was not fair to deprive tax-paying women of the\nprivilege to vote; a university education should not be a prerequisite\nfor admission to a dental college; the Catholic priests were to be\nrestrained in their efforts to gain control of the public schools.\n\nBut most wonderful of all, McTeague began to have ambitions--very\nvague, very confused ideas of something better--ideas for the most part\nborrowed from Trina. Some day, perhaps, he and his wife would have a\nhouse of their own. What a dream! A little home all to themselves, with\nsix rooms and a bath, with a grass plat in front and calla-lilies.\nThen there would be children. He would have a son, whose name would\nbe Daniel, who would go to High School, and perhaps turn out to be a\nprosperous plumber or house painter. Then this son Daniel would marry a\nwife, and they would all live together in that six-room-and-bath house;\nDaniel would have little children. McTeague would grow old among them\nall. The dentist saw himself as a venerable patriarch surrounded by\nchildren and grandchildren.\n\nSo the winter passed. It was a season of great happiness for the\nMcTeagues; the new life jostled itself into its grooves. A routine\nbegan.\n\nOn weekdays they rose at half-past six, being awakened by the boy who\nbrought the bottled milk, and who had instructions to pound upon the\nbedroom door in passing. Trina made breakfast--coffee, bacon and eggs,\nand a roll of Vienna bread from the bakery. The breakfast was eaten in\nthe kitchen, on the round deal table covered with the shiny oilcloth\ntable-spread tacked on. After breakfast the dentist immediately betook\nhimself to his \"Parlors\" to meet his early morning appointments--those\nmade with the clerks and shop girls who stopped in for half an hour on\ntheir way to their work.\n\nTrina, meanwhile, busied herself about the suite, clearing away the\nbreakfast, sponging off the oilcloth table-spread, making the bed,\npottering about with a broom or duster or cleaning rag. Towards ten\no'clock she opened the windows to air the rooms, then put on her drab\njacket, her little round turban with its red wing, took the butcher's\nand grocer's books from the knife basket in the drawer of the kitchen\ntable, and descended to the street, where she spent a delicious\nhour--now in the huge market across the way, now in the grocer's\nstore with its fragrant aroma of coffee and spices, and now before the\ncounters of the haberdasher's, intent on a bit of shopping, turning\nover ends of veiling, strips of elastic, or slivers of whalebone. On the\nstreet she rubbed elbows with the great ladies of the avenue in their\nbeautiful dresses, or at intervals she met an acquaintance or two--Miss\nBaker, or Heise's lame wife, or Mrs. Ryer. At times she passed the flat\nand looked up at the windows of her home, marked by the huge golden\nmolar that projected, flashing, from the bay window of the \"Parlors.\"\nShe saw the open windows of the sitting-room, the Nottingham lace\ncurtains stirring and billowing in the draft, and she caught sight of\nMaria Macapa's towelled head as the Mexican maid-of-all-work went to and\nfro in the suite, sweeping or carrying away the ashes. Occasionally in\nthe windows of the \"Parlors\" she beheld McTeague's rounded back as he\nbent to his work. Sometimes, even, they saw each other and waved their\nhands gayly in recognition.\n\nBy eleven o'clock Trina returned to the flat, her brown net\nreticule--once her mother's--full of parcels. At once she set about\ngetting lunch--sausages, perhaps, with mashed potatoes; or last\nevening's joint warmed over or made into a stew; chocolate, which\nTrina adored, and a side dish or two--a salted herring or a couple of\nartichokes or a salad. At half-past twelve the dentist came in from the\n\"Parlors,\" bringing with him the smell of creosote and of ether. They\nsat down to lunch in the sitting-room. They told each other of their\ndoings throughout the forenoon; Trina showed her purchases, McTeague\nrecounted the progress of an operation. At one o'clock they separated,\nthe dentist returning to the \"Parlors,\" Trina settling to her work on\nthe Noah's ark animals. At about three o'clock she put this work away,\nand for the rest of the afternoon was variously occupied--sometimes it\nwas the mending, sometimes the wash, sometimes new curtains to be put\nup, or a bit of carpet to be tacked down, or a letter to be written, or\na visit--generally to Miss Baker--to be returned. Towards five o'clock\nthe old woman whom they had hired for that purpose came to cook supper,\nfor even Trina was not equal to the task of preparing three meals a day.\n\nThis woman was French, and was known to the flat as Augustine, no one\ntaking enough interest in her to inquire for her last name; all that\nwas known of her was that she was a decayed French laundress, miserably\npoor, her trade long since ruined by Chinese competition. Augustine\ncooked well, but she was otherwise undesirable, and Trina lost\npatience with her at every moment. The old French woman's most marked\ncharacteristic was her timidity. Trina could scarcely address her a\nsimple direction without Augustine quailing and shrinking; a reproof,\nhowever gentle, threw her into an agony of confusion; while Trina's\nanger promptly reduced her to a state of nervous collapse, wherein she\nlost all power of speech, while her head began to bob and nod with an\nincontrollable twitching of the muscles, much like the oscillations\nof the head of a toy donkey. Her timidity was exasperating, her very\npresence in the room unstrung the nerves, while her morbid eagerness\nto avoid offence only served to develop in her a clumsiness that was at\ntimes beyond belief. More than once Trina had decided that she could no\nlonger put up with Augustine but each time she had retained her as she\nreflected upon her admirably cooked cabbage soups and tapioca puddings,\nand--which in Trina's eyes was her chiefest recommendation--the pittance\nfor which she was contented to work.\n\nAugustine had a husband. He was a spirit-medium--a \"professor.\" At times\nhe held seances in the larger rooms of the flat, playing vigorously upon\na mouth-organ and invoking a familiar whom he called \"Edna,\" and whom he\nasserted was an Indian maiden.\n\nThe evening was a period of relaxation for Trina and McTeague. They had\nsupper at six, after which McTeague smoked his pipe and read the papers\nfor half an hour, while Trina and Augustine cleared away the table and\nwashed the dishes. Then, as often as not, they went out together. One of\ntheir amusements was to go \"down town\" after dark and promenade\nMarket and Kearney Streets. It was very gay; a great many others were\npromenading there also. All of the stores were brilliantly lighted and\nmany of them still open. They walked about aimlessly, looking into\nthe shop windows. Trina would take McTeague's arm, and he, very much\nembarrassed at that, would thrust both hands into his pockets and\npretend not to notice. They stopped before the jewellers' and milliners'\nwindows, finding a great delight in picking out things for each other,\nsaying how they would choose this and that if they were rich. Trina did\nmost of the talking. McTeague merely approving by a growl or a movement\nof the head or shoulders; she was interested in the displays of some of\nthe cheaper stores, but he found an irresistible charm in an enormous\ngolden molar with four prongs that hung at a corner of Kearney Street.\nSometimes they would look at Mars or at the moon through the street\ntelescopes or sit for a time in the rotunda of a vast department store\nwhere a band played every evening.\n\nOccasionally they met Heise the harness-maker and his wife, with\nwhom they had become acquainted. Then the evening was concluded by a\nfour-cornered party in the Luxembourg, a quiet German restaurant under\na theatre. Trina had a tamale and a glass of beer, Mrs. Heise (who was\na decayed writing teacher) ate salads, with glasses of grenadine and\ncurrant syrups. Heise drank cocktails and whiskey straight, and urged\nthe dentist to join him. But McTeague was obstinate, shaking his head.\n\"I can't drink that stuff,\" he said. \"It don't agree with me, somehow;\nI go kinda crazy after two glasses.\" So he gorged himself with beer and\nfrankfurter sausages plastered with German mustard.\n\nWhen the annual Mechanic's Fair opened, McTeague and Trina often spent\ntheir evenings there, studying the exhibits carefully (since in Trina's\nestimation education meant knowing things and being able to talk about\nthem). Wearying of this they would go up into the gallery, and, leaning\nover, look down into the huge amphitheatre full of light and color and\nmovement.\n\nThere rose to them the vast shuffling noise of thousands of feet and\na subdued roar of conversation like the sound of a great mill. Mingled\nwith this was the purring of distant machinery, the splashing of a\ntemporary fountain, and the rhythmic jangling of a brass band, while\nin the piano exhibit a hired performer was playing upon a concert\ngrand with a great flourish. Nearer at hand they could catch ends of\nconversation and notes of laughter, the noise of moving dresses, and\nthe rustle of stiffly starched skirts. Here and there school children\nelbowed their way through the crowd, crying shrilly, their hands full of\nadvertisement pamphlets, fans, picture cards, and toy whips, while the\nair itself was full of the smell of fresh popcorn.\n\nThey even spent some time in the art gallery. Trina's cousin Selina,\nwho gave lessons in hand painting at two bits an hour, generally had an\nexhibit on the walls, which they were interested to find. It usually was\na bunch of yellow poppies painted on black velvet and framed in gilt.\nThey stood before it some little time, hazarding their opinions, and\nthen moved on slowly from one picture to another. Trina had McTeague buy\na catalogue and made a duty of finding the title of every picture. This,\ntoo, she told McTeague, as a kind of education one ought to cultivate.\nTrina professed to be fond of art, having perhaps acquired a taste for\npainting and sculpture from her experience with the Noah's ark animals.\n\n\"Of course,\" she told the dentist, \"I'm no critic, I only know what\nI like.\" She knew that she liked the \"Ideal Heads,\" lovely girls with\nflowing straw-colored hair and immense, upturned eyes. These always had\nfor title, \"Reverie,\" or \"An Idyll,\" or \"Dreams of Love.\"\n\n\"I think those are lovely, don't you, Mac?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes, yes,\" answered McTeague, nodding his head, bewildered, trying to\nunderstand. \"Yes, yes, lovely, that's the word. Are you dead sure now,\nTrina, that all that's hand-painted just like the poppies?\"\n\nThus the winter passed, a year went by, then two. The little life\nof Polk Street, the life of small traders, drug clerks, grocers,\nstationers, plumbers, dentists, doctors, spirit-mediums, and the like,\nran on monotonously in its accustomed grooves. The first three years\nof their married life wrought little change in the fortunes of the\nMcTeagues. In the third summer the branch post-office was moved from the\nground floor of the flat to a corner farther up the street in order\nto be near the cable line that ran mail cars. Its place was taken by\na German saloon, called a \"Wein Stube,\" in the face of the protests\nof every female lodger. A few months later quite a little flurry of\nexcitement ran through the street on the occasion of \"The Polk Street\nOpen Air Festival,\" organized to celebrate the introduction there of\nelectric lights. The festival lasted three days and was quite an affair.\nThe street was garlanded with yellow and white bunting; there were\nprocessions and \"floats\" and brass bands. Marcus Schouler was in his\nelement during the whole time of the celebration. He was one of the\nmarshals of the parade, and was to be seen at every hour of the\nday, wearing a borrowed high hat and cotton gloves, and galloping a\nbroken-down cab-horse over the cobbles. He carried a baton covered with\nyellow and white calico, with which he made furious passes and gestures.\nHis voice was soon reduced to a whisper by continued shouting, and he\nraged and fretted over trifles till he wore himself thin. McTeague was\ndisgusted with him. As often as Marcus passed the window of the flat the\ndentist would mutter:\n\n\"Ah, you think you're smart, don't you?\"\n\nThe result of the festival was the organizing of a body known as the\n\"Polk Street Improvement Club,\" of which Marcus was elected secretary.\nMcTeague and Trina often heard of him in this capacity through Heise the\nharness-maker. Marcus had evidently come to have political aspirations.\nIt appeared that he was gaining a reputation as a maker of speeches,\ndelivered with fiery emphasis, and occasionally reprinted in the\n\"Progress,\" the organ of the club--\"outraged constituencies,\" \"opinions\nwarped by personal bias,\" \"eyes blinded by party prejudice,\" etc.\n\nOf her family, Trina heard every fortnight in letters from her mother.\nThe upholstery business which Mr. Sieppe had bought was doing poorly,\nand Mrs. Sieppe bewailed the day she had ever left B Street. Mr. Sieppe\nwas losing money every month. Owgooste, who was to have gone to school,\nhad been forced to go to work in \"the store,\" picking waste. Mrs. Sieppe\nwas obliged to take a lodger or two. Affairs were in a very bad way.\nOccasionally she spoke of Marcus. Mr. Sieppe had not forgotten him\ndespite his own troubles, but still had an eye out for some one whom\nMarcus could \"go in with\" on a ranch.\n\nIt was toward the end of this period of three years that Trina and\nMcTeague had their first serious quarrel. Trina had talked so much about\nhaving a little house of their own at some future day, that McTeague had\nat length come to regard the affair as the end and object of all their\nlabors. For a long time they had had their eyes upon one house in\nparticular. It was situated on a cross street close by, between Polk\nStreet and the great avenue one block above, and hardly a Sunday\nafternoon passed that Trina and McTeague did not go and look at it.\nThey stood for fully half an hour upon the other side of the street,\nexamining every detail of its exterior, hazarding guesses as to\nthe arrangement of the rooms, commenting upon its immediate\nneighborhood--which was rather sordid. The house was a wooden two-story\narrangement, built by a misguided contractor in a sort of hideous\nQueen Anne style, all scrolls and meaningless mill work, with a cheap\nimitation of stained glass in the light over the door. There was a\nmicroscopic front yard full of dusty calla-lilies. The front door\nboasted an electric bell. But for the McTeagues it was an ideal home.\nTheir idea was to live in this little house, the dentist retaining\nmerely his office in the flat. The two places were but around the corner\nfrom each other, so that McTeague could lunch with his wife, as usual,\nand could even keep his early morning appointments and return to\nbreakfast if he so desired.\n\nHowever, the house was occupied. A Hungarian family lived in it.\nThe father kept a stationery and notion \"bazaar\" next to Heise's\nharness-shop on Polk Street, while the oldest son played a third violin\nin the orchestra of a theatre. The family rented the house unfurnished\nfor thirty-five dollars, paying extra for the water.\n\nBut one Sunday as Trina and McTeague on their way home from their\nusual walk turned into the cross street on which the little house was\nsituated, they became promptly aware of an unwonted bustle going on\nupon the sidewalk in front of it. A dray was back against the curb,\nan express wagon drove away loaded with furniture; bedsteads,\nlooking-glasses, and washbowls littered the sidewalks. The Hungarian\nfamily were moving out.\n\n\"Oh, Mac, look!\" gasped Trina.\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" muttered the dentist.\n\nAfter that they spoke but little. For upwards of an hour the two stood\nupon the sidewalk opposite, watching intently all that went forward,\nabsorbed, excited.\n\nOn the evening of the next day they returned and visited the house,\nfinding a great delight in going from room to room and imagining\nthemselves installed therein. Here would be the bedroom, here the\ndining-room, here a charming little parlor. As they came out upon the\nfront steps once more they met the owner, an enormous, red-faced fellow,\nso fat that his walking seemed merely a certain movement of his feet by\nwhich he pushed his stomach along in front of him. Trina talked with him\na few moments, but arrived at no understanding, and the two went away\nafter giving him their address. At supper that night McTeague said:\n\n\"Huh--what do you think, Trina?\"\n\nTrina put her chin in the air, tilting back her heavy tiara of swarthy\nhair.\n\n\"I am not so sure yet. Thirty-five dollars and the water extra. I don't\nthink we can afford it, Mac.\"\n\n\"Ah, pshaw!\" growled the dentist, \"sure we can.\"\n\n\"It isn't only that,\" said Trina, \"but it'll cost so much to make the\nchange.\"\n\n\"Ah, you talk's though we were paupers. Ain't we got five thousand\ndollars?\"\n\nTrina flushed on the instant, even to the lobes of her tiny pale ears,\nand put her lips together.\n\n\"Now, Mac, you know I don't want you should talk like that. That money's\nnever, never to be touched.\"\n\n\"And you've been savun up a good deal, besides,\" went on McTeague,\nexasperated at Trina's persistent economies. \"How much money have you\ngot in that little brass match-safe in the bottom of your trunk? Pretty\nnear a hundred dollars, I guess--ah, sure.\" He shut his eyes and nodded\nhis great head in a knowing way.\n\nTrina had more than that in the brass match-safe in question, but her\ninstinct of hoarding had led her to keep it a secret from her husband.\nNow she lied to him with prompt fluency.\n\n\"A hundred dollars! What are you talking of, Mac? I've not got fifty.\nI've not got THIRTY.\"\n\n\"Oh, let's take that little house,\" broke in McTeague. \"We got the\nchance now, and it may never come again. Come on, Trina, shall we? Say,\ncome on, shall we, huh?\"\n\n\"We'd have to be awful saving if we did, Mac.\"\n\n\"Well, sure, I say let's take it.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" said Trina, hesitating. \"Wouldn't it be lovely to have a\nhouse all to ourselves? But let's not decide until to-morrow.\"\n\nThe next day the owner of the house called. Trina was out at her\nmorning's marketing and the dentist, who had no one in the chair at the\ntime, received him in the \"Parlors.\" Before he was well aware of it,\nMcTeague had concluded the bargain. The owner bewildered him with a\nworld of phrases, made him believe that it would be a great saving to\nmove into the little house, and finally offered it to him \"water free.\"\n\n\"All right, all right,\" said McTeague, \"I'll take it.\"\n\nThe other immediately produced a paper.\n\n\"Well, then, suppose you sign for the first month's rent, and we'll\ncall it a bargain. That's business, you know,\" and McTeague, hesitating,\nsigned.\n\n\"I'd like to have talked more with my wife about it first,\" he said,\ndubiously.\n\n\"Oh, that's all right,\" answered the owner, easily. \"I guess if the head\nof the family wants a thing, that's enough.\"\n\nMcTeague could not wait until lunch time to tell the news to Trina. As\nsoon as he heard her come in, he laid down the plaster-of-paris mould\nhe was making and went out into the kitchen and found her chopping up\nonions.\n\n\"Well, Trina,\" he said, \"we got that house. I've taken it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she answered, quickly. The dentist told her.\n\n\"And you signed a paper for the first month's rent?\"\n\n\"Sure, sure. That's business, you know.\"\n\n\"Well, why did you DO it?\" cried Trina. \"You might have asked ME\nsomething about it. Now, what have you done? I was talking with Mrs.\nRyer about that house while I was out this morning, and she said the\nHungarians moved out because it was absolutely unhealthy; there's water\nbeen standing in the basement for months. And she told me, too,\" Trina\nwent on indignantly, \"that she knew the owner, and she was sure we could\nget the house for thirty if we'd bargain for it. Now what have you gone\nand done? I hadn't made up my mind about taking the house at all. And\nnow I WON'T take it, with the water in the basement and all.\"\n\n\"Well--well,\" stammered McTeague, helplessly, \"we needn't go in if it's\nunhealthy.\"\n\n\"But you've signed a PAPER,\" cried Trina, exasperated. \"You've got\nto pay that first month's rent, anyhow--to forfeit it. Oh, you are so\nstupid! There's thirty-five dollars just thrown away. I SHAN'T go into\nthat house; we won't move a FOOT out of here. I've changed my mind about\nit, and there's water in the basement besides.\"\n\n\"Well, I guess we can stand thirty-five dollars,\" mumbled the dentist,\n\"if we've got to.\"\n\n\"Thirty-five dollars just thrown out of the window,\" cried Trina, her\nteeth clicking, every instinct of her parsimony aroused. \"Oh, you the\nthick-wittedest man that I ever knew. Do you think we're millionaires?\nOh, to think of losing thirty-five dollars like that.\" Tears were in her\neyes, tears of grief as well as of anger. Never had McTeague seen his\nlittle woman so aroused. Suddenly she rose to her feet and slammed the\nchopping-bowl down upon the table. \"Well, I won't pay a nickel of it,\"\nshe exclaimed.\n\n\"Huh? What, what?\" stammered the dentist, taken all aback by her\noutburst.\n\n\"I say that you will find that money, that thirty-five dollars,\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Why--why----\"\n\n\"It's your stupidity got us into this fix, and you'll be the one that'll\nsuffer by it.\"\n\n\"I can't do it, I WON'T do it. We'll--we'll share and share alike. Why,\nyou said--you told me you'd take the house if the water was free.\"\n\n\"I NEVER did. I NEVER did. How can you stand there and say such a\nthing?\"\n\n\"You did tell me that,\" vociferated McTeague, beginning to get angry in\nhis turn.\n\n\"Mac, I didn't, and you know it. And what's more, I won't pay a nickel.\nMr. Heise pays his bill next week, it's forty-three dollars, and you can\njust pay the thirty-five out of that.\"\n\n\"Why, you got a whole hundred dollars saved up in your match-safe,\"\nshouted the dentist, throwing out an arm with an awkward gesture. \"You\npay half and I'll pay half, that's only fair.\"\n\n\"No, no, NO,\" exclaimed Trina. \"It's not a hundred dollars. You won't\ntouch it; you won't touch my money, I tell you.\"\n\n\"Ah, how does it happen to be yours, I'd like to know?\"\n\n\"It's mine! It's mine! It's mine!\" cried Trina, her face scarlet, her\nteeth clicking like the snap of a closing purse.\n\n\"It ain't any more yours than it is mine.\"\n\n\"Every penny of it is mine.\"\n\n\"Ah, what a fine fix you'd get me into,\" growled the dentist. \"I've\nsigned the paper with the owner; that's business, you know, that's\nbusiness, you know; and now you go back on me. Suppose we'd taken the\nhouse, we'd 'a' shared the rent, wouldn't we, just as we do here?\"\n\nTrina shrugged her shoulders with a great affectation of indifference\nand began chopping the onions again.\n\n\"You settle it with the owner,\" she said. \"It's your affair; you've got\nthe money.\" She pretended to assume a certain calmness as though the\nmatter was something that no longer affected her. Her manner exasperated\nMcTeague all the more.\n\n\"No, I won't; no, I won't; I won't either,\" he shouted. \"I'll pay my\nhalf and he can come to you for the other half.\" Trina put a hand over\nher ear to shut out his clamor.\n\n\"Ah, don't try and be smart,\" cried McTeague. \"Come, now, yes or no,\nwill you pay your half?\"\n\n\"You heard what I said.\"\n\n\"Will you pay it?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Miser!\" shouted McTeague. \"Miser! you're worse than old Zerkow. All\nright, all right, keep your money. I'll pay the whole thirty-five. I'd\nrather lose it than be such a miser as you.\"\n\n\"Haven't you got anything to do,\" returned Trina, \"instead of staying\nhere and abusing me?\"\n\n\"Well, then, for the last time, will you help me out?\" Trina cut the\nheads of a fresh bunch of onions and gave no answer.\n\n\"Huh? will you?\"\n\n\"I'd like to have my kitchen to myself, please,\" she said in a mincing\nway, irritating to a last degree. The dentist stamped out of the room,\nbanging the door behind him.\n\nFor nearly a week the breach between them remained unhealed. Trina only\nspoke to the dentist in monosyllables, while he, exasperated at her\ncalmness and frigid reserve, sulked in his \"Dental Parlors,\" muttering\nterrible things beneath his mustache, or finding solace in his\nconcertina, playing his six lugubrious airs over and over again, or\nswearing frightful oaths at his canary. When Heise paid his bill,\nMcTeague, in a fury, sent the amount to the owner of the little house.\n\nThere was no formal reconciliation between the dentist and his little\nwoman. Their relations readjusted themselves inevitably. By the end\nof the week they were as amicable as ever, but it was long before they\nspoke of the little house again. Nor did they ever revisit it of a\nSunday afternoon. A month or so later the Ryers told them that the owner\nhimself had moved in. The McTeagues never occupied that little house.\n\nBut Trina suffered a reaction after the quarrel. She began to be sorry\nshe had refused to help her husband, sorry she had brought matters\nto such an issue. One afternoon as she was at work on the Noah's ark\nanimals, she surprised herself crying over the affair. She loved her\n\"old bear\" too much to do him an injustice, and perhaps, after all, she\nhad been in the wrong. Then it occurred to her how pretty it would be\nto come up behind him unexpectedly, and slip the money, thirty-five\ndollars, into his hand, and pull his huge head down to her and kiss his\nbald spot as she used to do in the days before they were married.\n\nThen she hesitated, pausing in her work, her knife dropping into her\nlap, a half-whittled figure between her fingers. If not thirty-five\ndollars, then at least fifteen or sixteen, her share of it. But a\nfeeling of reluctance, a sudden revolt against this intended generosity,\narose in her.\n\n\"No, no,\" she said to herself. \"I'll give him ten dollars. I'll tell him\nit's all I can afford. It IS all I can afford.\"\n\nShe hastened to finish the figure of the animal she was then at work\nupon, putting in the ears and tail with a drop of glue, and tossing it\ninto the basket at her side. Then she rose and went into the bedroom and\nopened her trunk, taking the key from under a corner of the carpet where\nshe kept it hid.\n\nAt the very bottom of her trunk, under her bridal dress, she kept her\nsavings. It was all in change--half dollars and dollars for the most\npart, with here and there a gold piece. Long since the little brass\nmatch-box had overflowed. Trina kept the surplus in a chamois-skin\nsack she had made from an old chest protector. Just now, yielding to\nan impulse which often seized her, she drew out the match-box and\nthe chamois sack, and emptying the contents on the bed, counted them\ncarefully. It came to one hundred and sixty-five dollars, all told. She\ncounted it and recounted it and made little piles of it, and rubbed the\ngold pieces between the folds of her apron until they shone.\n\n\"Ah, yes, ten dollars is all I can afford to give Mac,\" said Trina,\n\"and even then, think of it, ten dollars--it will be four or five months\nbefore I can save that again. But, dear old Mac, I know it would make\nhim feel glad, and perhaps,\" she added, suddenly taken with an idea,\n\"perhaps Mac will refuse to take it.\"\n\nShe took a ten-dollar piece from the heap and put the rest away. Then\nshe paused:\n\n\"No, not the gold piece,\" she said to herself. \"It's too pretty. He can\nhave the silver.\" She made the change and counted out ten silver dollars\ninto her palm. But what a difference it made in the appearance and\nweight of the little chamois bag! The bag was shrunken and withered,\nlong wrinkles appeared running downward from the draw-string. It was a\nlamentable sight. Trina looked longingly at the ten broad pieces in her\nhand. Then suddenly all her intuitive desire of saving, her instinct\nof hoarding, her love of money for the money's sake, rose strong within\nher.\n\n\"No, no, no,\" she said. \"I can't do it. It may be mean, but I can't help\nit. It's stronger than I.\" She returned the money to the bag and locked\nit and the brass match-box in her trunk, turning the key with a long\nbreath of satisfaction.\n\nShe was a little troubled, however, as she went back into the\nsitting-room and took up her work.\n\n\"I didn't use to be so stingy,\" she told herself. \"Since I won in the\nlottery I've become a regular little miser. It's growing on me, but\nnever mind, it's a good fault, and, anyhow, I can't help it.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 11\n\n\nOn that particular morning the McTeagues had risen a half hour earlier\nthan usual and taken a hurried breakfast in the kitchen on the deal\ntable with its oilcloth cover. Trina was house-cleaning that week and\nhad a presentiment of a hard day's work ahead of her, while McTeague\nremembered a seven o'clock appointment with a little German shoemaker.\n\nAt about eight o'clock, when the dentist had been in his office for over\nan hour, Trina descended upon the bedroom, a towel about her head\nand the roller-sweeper in her hand. She covered the bureau and sewing\nmachine with sheets, and unhooked the chenille portieres between the\nbedroom and the sitting-room. As she was tying the Nottingham lace\ncurtains at the window into great knots, she saw old Miss Baker on the\nopposite sidewalk in the street below, and raising the sash called down\nto her.\n\n\"Oh, it's you, Mrs. McTeague,\" cried the retired dressmaker, facing\nabout, her head in the air. Then a long conversation was begun, Trina,\nher arms folded under her breast, her elbows resting on the\nwindow ledge, willing to be idle for a moment; old Miss Baker, her\nmarket-basket on her arm, her hands wrapped in the ends of her worsted\nshawl against the cold of the early morning. They exchanged phrases,\ncalling to each other from window to curb, their breath coming from\ntheir lips in faint puffs of vapor, their voices shrill, and raised to\ndominate the clamor of the waking street. The newsboys had made their\nappearance on the street, together with the day laborers. The cable cars\nhad begun to fill up; all along the street could be seen the shopkeepers\ntaking down their shutters; some were still breakfasting. Now and then\na waiter from one of the cheap restaurants crossed from one sidewalk to\nanother, balancing on one palm a tray covered with a napkin.\n\n\"Aren't you out pretty early this morning, Miss Baker?\" called Trina.\n\n\"No, no,\" answered the other. \"I'm always up at half-past six, but I\ndon't always get out so soon. I wanted to get a nice head of cabbage\nand some lentils for a soup, and if you don't go to market early, the\nrestaurants get all the best.\"\n\n\"And you've been to market already, Miss Baker?\"\n\n\"Oh, my, yes; and I got a fish--a sole--see.\" She drew the sole in\nquestion from her basket.\n\n\"Oh, the lovely sole!\" exclaimed Trina.\n\n\"I got this one at Spadella's; he always has good fish on Friday. How is\nthe doctor, Mrs. McTeague?\"\n\n\"Ah, Mac is always well, thank you, Miss Baker.\"\n\n\"You know, Mrs. Ryer told me,\" cried the little dressmaker, moving\nforward a step out of the way of a \"glass-put-in\" man, \"that Doctor\nMcTeague pulled a tooth of that Catholic priest, Father--oh, I forget\nhis name--anyhow, he pulled his tooth with his fingers. Was that true,\nMrs. McTeague?\"\n\n\"Oh, of course. Mac does that almost all the time now, 'specially with\nfront teeth. He's got a regular reputation for it. He says it's brought\nhim more patients than even the sign I gave him,\" she added, pointing to\nthe big golden molar projecting from the office window.\n\n\"With his fingers! Now, think of that,\" exclaimed Miss Baker, wagging\nher head. \"Isn't he that strong! It's just wonderful. Cleaning house\nto-day?\" she inquired, glancing at Trina's towelled head.\n\n\"Um hum,\" answered Trina. \"Maria Macapa's coming in to help pretty\nsoon.\"\n\nAt the mention of Maria's name the little old dressmaker suddenly\nuttered an exclamation.\n\n\"Well, if I'm not here talking to you and forgetting something I was\njust dying to tell you. Mrs. McTeague, what ever in the world do\nyou suppose? Maria and old Zerkow, that red-headed Polish Jew, the\nrag-bottles-sacks man, you know, they're going to be married.\"\n\n\"No!\" cried Trina, in blank amazement. \"You don't mean it.\"\n\n\"Of course I do. Isn't it the funniest thing you ever heard of?\"\n\n\"Oh, tell me all about it,\" said Trina, leaning eagerly from the window.\nMiss Baker crossed the street and stood just beneath her.\n\n\"Well, Maria came to me last night and wanted me to make her a new gown,\nsaid she wanted something gay, like what the girls at the candy store\nwear when they go out with their young men. I couldn't tell what had\ngot into the girl, until finally she told me she wanted something to get\nmarried in, and that Zerkow had asked her to marry him, and that she was\ngoing to do it. Poor Maria! I guess it's the first and only offer she\never received, and it's just turned her head.\"\n\n\"But what DO those two see in each other?\" cried Trina. \"Zerkow is a\nhorror, he's an old man, and his hair is red and his voice is gone, and\nthen he's a Jew, isn't he?\"\n\n\"I know, I know; but it's Maria's only chance for a husband, and she\ndon't mean to let it pass. You know she isn't quite right in her head,\nanyhow. I'm awfully sorry for poor Maria. But I can't see what Zerkow\nwants to marry her for. It's not possible that he's in love with Maria,\nit's out of the question. Maria hasn't a sou, either, and I'm just\npositive that Zerkow has lots of money.\"\n\n\"I'll bet I know why,\" exclaimed Trina, with sudden conviction; \"yes,\nI know just why. See here, Miss Baker, you know how crazy old Zerkow is\nafter money and gold and those sort of things.\"\n\n\"Yes, I know; but you know Maria hasn't----\"\n\n\"Now, just listen. You've heard Maria tell about that wonderful service\nof gold dishes she says her folks used to own in Central America; she's\ncrazy on that subject, don't you know. She's all right on everything\nelse, but just start her on that service of gold plate and she'll talk\nyou deaf. She can describe it just as though she saw it, and she can\nmake you see it, too, almost. Now, you see, Maria and Zerkow have known\neach other pretty well. Maria goes to him every two weeks or so to sell\nhim junk; they got acquainted that way, and I know Maria's been dropping\nin to see him pretty often this last year, and sometimes he comes here\nto see her. He's made Maria tell him the story of that plate over and\nover and over again, and Maria does it and is glad to, because he's the\nonly one that believes it. Now he's going to marry her just so's he can\nhear that story every day, every hour. He's pretty near as crazy on the\nsubject as Maria is. They're a pair for you, aren't they? Both crazy\nover a lot of gold dishes that never existed. Perhaps Maria'll marry him\nbecause it's her only chance to get a husband, but I'm sure it's more\nfor the reason that she's got some one to talk to now who believes her\nstory. Don't you think I'm right?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I guess you're right,\" admitted Miss Baker.\n\n\"But it's a queer match anyway you put it,\" said Trina, musingly.\n\n\"Ah, you may well say that,\" returned the other, nodding her head. There\nwas a silence. For a long moment the dentist's wife and the retired\ndressmaker, the one at the window, the other on the sidewalk, remained\nlost in thought, wondering over the strangeness of the affair.\n\nBut suddenly there was a diversion. Alexander, Marcus Schouler's Irish\nsetter, whom his master had long since allowed the liberty of running\nuntrammelled about the neighborhood, turned the corner briskly and came\ntrotting along the sidewalk where Miss Baker stood. At the same moment\nthe Scotch collie who had at one time belonged to the branch post-office\nissued from the side door of a house not fifty feet away. In an instant\nthe two enemies had recognized each other. They halted abruptly, their\nfore feet planted rigidly. Trina uttered a little cry.\n\n\"Oh, look out, Miss Baker. Those two dogs hate each other just like\nhumans. You best look out. They'll fight sure.\" Miss Baker sought\nsafety in a nearby vestibule, whence she peered forth at the scene, very\ninterested and curious. Maria Macapa's head thrust itself from one of\nthe top-story windows of the flat, with a shrill cry. Even McTeague's\nhuge form appeared above the half curtains of the \"Parlor\" windows,\nwhile over his shoulder could be seen the face of the \"patient,\" a\nnapkin tucked in his collar, the rubber dam depending from his mouth.\nAll the flat knew of the feud between the dogs, but never before had the\npair been brought face to face.\n\nMeanwhile, the collie and the setter had drawn near to each other;\nfive feet apart they paused as if by mutual consent. The collie turned\nsidewise to the setter; the setter instantly wheeled himself flank on to\nthe collie. Their tails rose and stiffened, they raised their lips over\ntheir long white fangs, the napes of their necks bristled, and they\nshowed each other the vicious whites of their eyes, while they drew in\ntheir breaths with prolonged and rasping snarls. Each dog seemed to be\nthe personification of fury and unsatisfied hate. They began to circle\nabout each other with infinite slowness, walking stiffed-legged and\nupon the very points of their feet. Then they wheeled about and began to\ncircle in the opposite direction. Twice they repeated this motion, their\nsnarls growing louder. But still they did not come together, and\nthe distance of five feet between them was maintained with an almost\nmathematical precision. It was magnificent, but it was not war. Then the\nsetter, pausing in his walk, turned his head slowly from his enemy. The\ncollie sniffed the air and pretended an interest in an old shoe lying\nin the gutter. Gradually and with all the dignity of monarchs they\nmoved away from each other. Alexander stalked back to the corner of\nthe street. The collie paced toward the side gate whence he had issued,\naffecting to remember something of great importance. They disappeared.\nOnce out of sight of one another they began to bark furiously.\n\n\"Well, I NEVER!\" exclaimed Trina in great disgust. \"The way those two\ndogs have been carrying on you'd 'a' thought they would 'a' just torn\neach other to pieces when they had the chance, and here I'm wasting the\nwhole morning----\" she closed her window with a bang.\n\n\"Sick 'im, sick 'im,\" called Maria Macapa, in a vain attempt to promote\na fight.\n\nOld Miss Baker came out of the vestibule, pursing her lips, quite\nput out at the fiasco. \"And after all that fuss,\" she said to herself\naggrievedly.\n\nThe little dressmaker bought an envelope of nasturtium seeds at the\nflorist's, and returned to her tiny room in the flat. But as she slowly\nmounted the first flight of steps she suddenly came face to face with\nOld Grannis, who was coming down. It was between eight and nine, and\nhe was on his way to his little dog hospital, no doubt. Instantly Miss\nBaker was seized with trepidation, her curious little false curls shook,\na faint--a very faint--flush came into her withered cheeks, and her\nheart beat so violently under the worsted shawl that she felt obliged\nto shift the market-basket to her other arm and put out her free hand to\nsteady herself against the rail.\n\nOn his part, Old Grannis was instantly overwhelmed with confusion. His\nawkwardness seemed to paralyze his limbs, his lips twitched and turned\ndry, his hand went tremblingly to his chin. But what added to Miss\nBaker's miserable embarrassment on this occasion was the fact that the\nold Englishman should meet her thus, carrying a sordid market-basket\nfull of sordid fish and cabbage. It seemed as if a malicious fate\npersisted in bringing the two old people face to face at the most\ninopportune moments.\n\nJust now, however, a veritable catastrophe occurred. The little old\ndressmaker changed her basket to her other arm at precisely the wrong\nmoment, and Old Grannis, hastening to pass, removing his hat in a\nhurried salutation, struck it with his fore arm, knocking it from her\ngrasp, and sending it rolling and bumping down the stairs. The sole fell\nflat upon the first landing; the lentils scattered themselves over the\nentire flight; while the cabbage, leaping from step to step, thundered\ndown the incline and brought up against the street door with a shock\nthat reverberated through the entire building.\n\nThe little retired dressmaker, horribly vexed, nervous and embarrassed,\nwas hard put to it to keep back the tears. Old Grannis stood for a\nmoment with averted eyes, murmuring: \"Oh, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.\nI--I really--I beg your pardon, really--really.\"\n\nMarcus Schouler, coming down stairs from his room, saved the situation.\n\n\"Hello, people,\" he cried. \"By damn! you've upset your basket--you have,\nfor a fact. Here, let's pick um up.\" He and Old Grannis went up and down\nthe flight, gathering up the fish, the lentils, and the sadly battered\ncabbage. Marcus was raging over the pusillanimity of Alexander, of which\nMaria had just told him.\n\n\"I'll cut him in two--with the whip,\" he shouted. \"I will, I will, I say\nI will, for a fact. He wouldn't fight, hey? I'll give um all the fight\nhe wants, nasty, mangy cur. If he won't fight he won't eat. I'm going\nto get the butcher's bull pup and I'll put um both in a bag and shake um\nup. I will, for a fact, and I guess Alec will fight. Come along, Mister\nGrannis,\" and he took the old Englishman away.\n\nLittle Miss Baker hastened to her room and locked herself in. She was\nexcited and upset during all the rest of the day, and listened eagerly\nfor Old Grannis's return that evening. He went instantly to work binding\nup \"The Breeder and Sportsman,\" and back numbers of the \"Nation.\" She\nheard him softly draw his chair and the table on which he had placed his\nlittle binding apparatus close to the wall. At once she did the same,\nbrewing herself a cup of tea. All through that evening the two old\npeople \"kept company\" with each other, after their own peculiar fashion.\n\"Setting out with each other\" Miss Baker had begun to call it. That they\nhad been presented, that they had even been forced to talk together, had\nmade no change in their relative positions. Almost immediately they\nhad fallen back into their old ways again, quite unable to master their\ntimidity, to overcome the stifling embarrassment that seized upon them\nwhen in each other's presence. It was a sort of hypnotism, a thing\nstronger than themselves. But they were not altogether dissatisfied with\nthe way things had come to be. It was their little romance, their\nlast, and they were living through it with supreme enjoyment and calm\ncontentment.\n\nMarcus Schouler still occupied his old room on the floor above the\nMcTeagues. They saw but little of him, however. At long intervals the\ndentist or his wife met him on the stairs of the flat. Sometimes he\nwould stop and talk with Trina, inquiring after the Sieppes, asking her\nif Mr. Sieppe had yet heard of any one with whom he, Marcus, could \"go\nin with on a ranch.\" McTeague, Marcus merely nodded to. Never had the\nquarrel between the two men been completely patched up. It did not seem\npossible to the dentist now that Marcus had ever been his \"pal,\" that\nthey had ever taken long walks together. He was sorry that he had\ntreated Marcus gratis for an ulcerated tooth, while Marcus daily\nrecalled the fact that he had given up his \"girl\" to his friend--the\ngirl who had won a fortune--as the great mistake of his life. Only\nonce since the wedding had he called upon Trina, at a time when he knew\nMcTeague would be out. Trina had shown him through the rooms and had\ntold him, innocently enough, how gay was their life there. Marcus had\ncome away fairly sick with envy; his rancor against the dentist--and\nagainst himself, for that matter--knew no bounds. \"And you might 'a' had\nit all yourself, Marcus Schouler,\" he muttered to himself on the stairs.\n\"You mushhead, you damn fool!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Marcus was becoming involved in the politics of his ward. As\nsecretary of the Polk Street Improvement Club--which soon developed\ninto quite an affair and began to assume the proportions of a Republican\npolitical machine--he found he could make a little, a very little more\nthan enough to live on. At once he had given up his position as Old\nGrannis's assistant in the dog hospital. Marcus felt that he needed a\nwider sphere. He had his eye upon a place connected with the city pound.\nWhen the great railroad strike occurred, he promptly got himself engaged\nas deputy-sheriff, and spent a memorable week in Sacramento, where he\ninvolved himself in more than one terrible melee with the strikers.\nMarcus had that quickness of temper and passionate readiness to take\noffence which passes among his class for bravery. But whatever were\nhis motives, his promptness to face danger could not for a moment be\ndoubted. After the strike he returned to Polk Street, and throwing\nhimself into the Improvement Club, heart, soul, and body, soon became\none of its ruling spirits. In a certain local election, where a huge\npaving contract was at stake, the club made itself felt in the ward, and\nMarcus so managed his cards and pulled his wires that, at the end of the\nmatter, he found himself some four hundred dollars to the good.\n\nWhen McTeague came out of his \"Parlors\" at noon of the day upon which\nTrina had heard the news of Maria Macapa's intended marriage, he found\nTrina burning coffee on a shovel in the sitting-room. Try as she would,\nTrina could never quite eradicate from their rooms a certain faint\nand indefinable odor, particularly offensive to her. The smell of the\nphotographer's chemicals persisted in spite of all Trina could do to\ncombat it. She burnt pastilles and Chinese punk, and even, as now,\ncoffee on a shovel, all to no purpose. Indeed, the only drawback to\ntheir delightful home was the general unpleasant smell that pervaded\nit--a smell that arose partly from the photographer's chemicals, partly\nfrom the cooking in the little kitchen, and partly from the ether and\ncreosote of the dentist's \"Parlors.\"\n\nAs McTeague came in to lunch on this occasion, he found the table\nalready laid, a red cloth figured with white flowers was spread, and as\nhe took his seat his wife put down the shovel on a chair and brought\nin the stewed codfish and the pot of chocolate. As he tucked his napkin\ninto his enormous collar, McTeague looked vaguely about the room,\nrolling his eyes.\n\nDuring the three years of their married life the McTeagues had made but\nfew additions to their furniture, Trina declaring that they could not\nafford it. The sitting-room could boast of but three new ornaments. Over\nthe melodeon hung their marriage certificate in a black frame. It was\nbalanced upon one side by Trina's wedding bouquet under a glass case,\npreserved by some fearful unknown process, and upon the other by the\nphotograph of Trina and the dentist in their wedding finery. This latter\npicture was quite an affair, and had been taken immediately after the\nwedding, while McTeague's broadcloth was still new, and before Trina's\nsilks and veil had lost their stiffness. It represented Trina, her veil\nthrown back, sitting very straight in a rep armchair, her elbows well\nin at her sides, holding her bouquet of cut flowers directly before\nher. The dentist stood at her side, one hand on her shoulder, the other\nthrust into the breast of his \"Prince Albert,\" his chin in the air, his\neyes to one side, his left foot forward in the attitude of a statue of a\nSecretary of State.\n\n\"Say, Trina,\" said McTeague, his mouth full of codfish, \"Heise looked in\non me this morning. He says 'What's the matter with a basket picnic over\nat Schuetzen Park next Tuesday?' You know the paper-hangers are going\nto be in the 'Parlors' all that day, so I'll have a holiday. That's what\nmade Heise think of it. Heise says he'll get the Ryers to go too. It's\nthe anniversary of their wedding day. We'll ask Selina to go; she can\nmeet us on the other side. Come on, let's go, huh, will you?\"\n\nTrina still had her mania for family picnics, which had been one of the\nSieppes most cherished customs; but now there were other considerations.\n\n\"I don't know as we can afford it this month, Mac,\" she said, pouring\nthe chocolate. \"I got to pay the gas bill next week, and there's the\npapering of your office to be paid for some time.\"\n\n\"I know, I know,\" answered her husband. \"But I got a new patient this\nweek, had two molars and an upper incisor filled at the very first\nsitting, and he's going to bring his children round. He's a barber on\nthe next block.\"\n\n\"Well you pay half, then,\" said Trina. \"It'll cost three or four dollars\nat the very least; and mind, the Heises pay their own fare both ways,\nMac, and everybody gets their OWN lunch. Yes,\" she added, after a pause,\n\"I'll write and have Selina join us. I haven't seen Selina in months. I\nguess I'll have to put up a lunch for her, though,\" admitted Trina, \"the\nway we did last time, because she lives in a boarding-house now, and\nthey make a fuss about putting up a lunch.\"\n\nThey could count on pleasant weather at this time of the year--it was\nMay--and that particular Tuesday was all that could be desired. The\nparty assembled at the ferry slip at nine o'clock, laden with baskets.\nThe McTeagues came last of all; Ryer and his wife had already boarded\nthe boat. They met the Heises in the waiting-room.\n\n\"Hello, Doctor,\" cried the harness-maker as the McTeagues came up. \"This\nis what you'd call an old folks' picnic, all married people this time.\"\n\nThe party foregathered on the upper deck as the boat started, and sat\ndown to listen to the band of Italian musicians who were playing outside\nthis morning because of the fineness of the weather.\n\n\"Oh, we're going to have lots of fun,\" cried Trina. \"If it's anything I\ndo love it's a picnic. Do you remember our first picnic, Mac?\"\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" replied the dentist; \"we had a Gotha truffle.\"\n\n\"And August lost his steamboat,\" put in Trina, \"and papa smacked him. I\nremember it just as well.\"\n\n\"Why, look there,\" said Mrs. Heise, nodding at a figure coming up the\ncompanion-way. \"Ain't that Mr. Schouler?\"\n\nIt was Marcus, sure enough. As he caught sight of the party he gaped at\nthem a moment in blank astonishment, and then ran up, his eyes wide.\n\n\"Well, by damn!\" he exclaimed, excitedly. \"What's up? Where you all\ngoing, anyhow? Say, ain't ut queer we should all run up against each\nother like this?\" He made great sweeping bows to the three women, and\nshook hands with \"Cousin Trina,\" adding, as he turned to the men of\nthe party, \"Glad to see you, Mister Heise. How do, Mister Ryer?\" The\ndentist, who had formulated some sort of reserved greeting, he\nignored completely. McTeague settled himself in his seat, growling\ninarticulately behind his mustache.\n\n\"Say, say, what's all up, anyhow?\" cried Marcus again.\n\n\"It's a picnic,\" exclaimed the three women, all speaking at once; and\nTrina added, \"We're going over to the same old Schuetzen Park again. But\nyou're all fixed up yourself, Cousin Mark; you look as though you were\ngoing somewhere yourself.\"\n\nIn fact, Marcus was dressed with great care. He wore a new pair of\nslate-blue trousers, a black \"cutaway,\" and a white lawn \"tie\" (for him\nthe symbol of the height of elegance). He carried also his cane, a thin\nwand of ebony with a gold head, presented to him by the Improvement Club\nin \"recognition of services.\"\n\n\"That's right, that's right,\" said Marcus, with a grin. \"I'm takun a\nholiday myself to-day. I had a bit of business to do over at Oakland,\nan' I thought I'd go up to B Street afterward and see Selina. I haven't\ncalled on----\"\n\nBut the party uttered an exclamation.\n\n\"Why, Selina is going with us.\"\n\n\"She's going to meet us at the Schuetzen Park station\" explained Trina.\n\nMarcus's business in Oakland was a fiction. He was crossing the bay that\nmorning solely to see Selina. Marcus had \"taken up with\" Selina a little\nafter Trina had married, and had been \"rushing\" her ever since, dazzled\nand attracted by her accomplishments, for which he pretended a great\nrespect. At the prospect of missing Selina on this occasion, he was\ngenuinely disappointed. His vexation at once assumed the form of\nexasperation against McTeague. It was all the dentist's fault. Ah,\nMcTeague was coming between him and Selina now as he had come between\nhim and Trina. Best look out, by damn! how he monkeyed with him now.\nInstantly his face flamed and he glanced over furiously at the dentist,\nwho, catching his eye, began again to mutter behind his mustache.\n\n\"Well, say,\" began Mrs. Ryer, with some hesitation, looking to Ryer for\napproval, \"why can't Marcus come along with us?\"\n\n\"Why, of course,\" exclaimed Mrs. Heise, disregarding her husband's\nvigorous nudges. \"I guess we got lunch enough to go round, all right;\ndon't you say so, Mrs. McTeague?\"\n\nThus appealed to, Trina could only concur.\n\n\"Why, of course, Cousin Mark,\" she said; \"of course, come along with us\nif you want to.\"\n\n\"Why, you bet I will,\" cried Marcus, enthusiastic in an instant. \"Say,\nthis is outa sight; it is, for a fact; a picnic--ah, sure--and we'll\nmeet Selina at the station.\"\n\nJust as the boat was passing Goat Island, the harness-maker proposed\nthat the men of the party should go down to the bar on the lower deck\nand shake for the drinks. The idea had an immediate success.\n\n\"Have to see you on that,\" said Ryer.\n\n\"By damn, we'll have a drink! Yes, sir, we will, for a fact.\"\n\n\"Sure, sure, drinks, that's the word.\"\n\nAt the bar Heise and Ryer ordered cocktails, Marcus called for a \"creme\nYvette\" in order to astonish the others. The dentist spoke for a glass\nof beer.\n\n\"Say, look here,\" suddenly exclaimed Heise as they took their glasses.\n\"Look here, you fellahs,\" he had turned to Marcus and the dentist. \"You\ntwo fellahs have had a grouch at each other for the last year or so; now\nwhat's the matter with your shaking hands and calling quits?\"\n\nMcTeague was at once overcome with a great feeling of magnanimity. He\nput out his great hand.\n\n\"I got nothing against Marcus,\" he growled.\n\n\"Well, I don't care if I shake,\" admitted Marcus, a little shamefacedly,\nas their palms touched. \"I guess that's all right.\"\n\n\"That's the idea,\" exclaimed Heise, delighted at his success. \"Come on,\nboys, now let's drink.\" Their elbows crooked and they drank silently.\n\nTheir picnic that day was very jolly. Nothing had changed at Schuetzen\nPark since the day of that other memorable Sieppe picnic four years\nprevious. After lunch the men took themselves off to the rifle range,\nwhile Selina, Trina, and the other two women put away the dishes.\nAn hour later the men joined them in great spirits. Ryer had won the\nimpromptu match which they had arranged, making quite a wonderful score,\nwhich included three clean bulls' eyes, while McTeague had not been able\neven to hit the target itself.\n\nTheir shooting match had awakened a spirit of rivalry in the men, and\nthe rest of the afternoon was passed in athletic exercises between them.\nThe women sat on the slope of the grass, their hats and gloves laid\naside, watching the men as they strove together. Aroused by the little\nfeminine cries of wonder and the clapping of their ungloved palms, these\nlatter began to show off at once. They took off their coats and vests,\neven their neckties and collars, and worked themselves into a lather of\nperspiration for the sake of making an impression on their wives. They\nran hundred-yard sprints on the cinder path and executed clumsy feats on\nthe rings and on the parallel bars. They even found a huge round\nstone on the beach and \"put the shot\" for a while. As long as it was\na question of agility, Marcus was easily the best of the four; but the\ndentist's enormous strength, his crude, untutored brute force, was\na matter of wonder for the entire party. McTeague cracked English\nwalnuts--taken from the lunch baskets--in the hollow of his arm, and\ntossed the round stone a full five feet beyond their best mark. Heise\nbelieved himself to be particularly strong in the wrists, but the\ndentist, using but one hand, twisted a cane out of Heise's two with a\nwrench that all but sprained the harnessmaker's arm. Then the dentist\nraised weights and chinned himself on the rings till they thought he\nwould never tire.\n\nHis great success quite turned his head; he strutted back and forth\nin front of the women, his chest thrown out, and his great mouth\nperpetually expanded in a triumphant grin. As he felt his strength more\nand more, he began to abuse it; he domineered over the others, gripping\nsuddenly at their arms till they squirmed with pain, and slapping Marcus\non the back so that he gasped and gagged for breath. The childish vanity\nof the great fellow was as undisguised as that of a schoolboy. He began\nto tell of wonderful feats of strength he had accomplished when he was a\nyoung man. Why, at one time he had knocked down a half-grown heifer\nwith a blow of his fist between the eyes, sure, and the heifer had just\nstiffened out and trembled all over and died without getting up.\n\nMcTeague told this story again, and yet again. All through the afternoon\nhe could be overheard relating the wonder to any one who would listen,\nexaggerating the effect of his blow, inventing terrific details. Why,\nthe heifer had just frothed at the mouth, and his eyes had rolled\nup--ah, sure, his eyes rolled up just like that--and the butcher had\nsaid his skull was all mashed in--just all mashed in, sure, that's the\nword--just as if from a sledge-hammer.\n\nNotwithstanding his reconciliation with the dentist on the boat,\nMarcus's gorge rose within him at McTeague's boasting swagger. When\nMcTeague had slapped him on the back, Marcus had retired to some little\ndistance while he recovered his breath, and glared at the dentist\nfiercely as he strode up and down, glorying in the admiring glances of\nthe women.\n\n\"Ah, one-horse dentist,\" he muttered between his teeth. \"Ah,\nzinc-plugger, cow-killer, I'd like to show you once, you overgrown\nmucker, you--you--COW-KILLER!\"\n\nWhen he rejoined the group, he found them preparing for a wrestling\nbout.\n\n\"I tell you what,\" said Heise, \"we'll have a tournament. Marcus and I\nwill rastle, and Doc and Ryer, and then the winners will rastle each\nother.\"\n\nThe women clapped their hands excitedly. This would be exciting. Trina\ncried:\n\n\"Better let me hold your money, Mac, and your keys, so as you won't lose\nthem out of your pockets.\" The men gave their valuables into the keeping\nof their wives and promptly set to work.\n\nThe dentist thrust Ryer down without even changing his grip; Marcus and\nthe harness-maker struggled together for a few moments till Heise all at\nonce slipped on a bit of turf and fell backwards. As they toppled over\ntogether, Marcus writhed himself from under his opponent, and, as they\nreached the ground, forced down first one shoulder and then the other.\n\n\"All right, all right,\" panted the harness-maker, goodnaturedly, \"I'm\ndown. It's up to you and Doc now,\" he added, as he got to his feet.\n\nThe match between McTeague and Marcus promised to be interesting. The\ndentist, of course, had an enormous advantage in point of strength,\nbut Marcus prided himself on his wrestling, and knew something about\nstrangle-holds and half-Nelsons. The men drew back to allow them a free\nspace as they faced each other, while Trina and the other women rose to\ntheir feet in their excitement.\n\n\"I bet Mac will throw him, all the same,\" said Trina.\n\n\"All ready!\" cried Ryer.\n\nThe dentist and Marcus stepped forward, eyeing each other cautiously.\nThey circled around the impromptu ring. Marcus watching eagerly for an\nopening. He ground his teeth, telling himself he would throw McTeague\nif it killed him. Ah, he'd show him now. Suddenly the two men caught at\neach other; Marcus went to his knees. The dentist threw his vast bulk on\nhis adversary's shoulders and, thrusting a huge palm against his face,\npushed him backwards and downwards. It was out of the question to resist\nthat enormous strength. Marcus wrenched himself over and fell face\ndownward on the ground.\n\nMcTeague rose on the instant with a great laugh of exultation.\n\n\"You're down!\" he exclaimed.\n\nMarcus leaped to his feet.\n\n\"Down nothing,\" he vociferated, with clenched fists. \"Down nothing, by\ndamn! You got to throw me so's my shoulders touch.\"\n\nMcTeague was stalking about, swelling with pride.\n\n\"Hoh, you're down. I threw you. Didn't I throw him, Trina? Hoh, you\ncan't rastle ME.\"\n\nMarcus capered with rage.\n\n\"You didn't! you didn't! you didn't! and you can't! You got to give me\nanother try.\"\n\nThe other men came crowding up. Everybody was talking at once.\n\n\"He's right.\"\n\n\"You didn't throw him.\"\n\n\"Both his shoulders at the same time.\"\n\nTrina clapped and waved her hand at McTeague from where she stood on\nthe little slope of lawn above the wrestlers. Marcus broke through the\ngroup, shaking all over with excitement and rage.\n\n\"I tell you that ain't the WAY to rastle. You've got to throw a man so's\nhis shoulders touch. You got to give me another bout.\"\n\n\"That's straight,\" put in Heise, \"both his shoulders down at the same\ntime. Try it again. You and Schouler have another try.\"\n\nMcTeague was bewildered by so much simultaneous talk. He could not make\nout what it was all about. Could he have offended Marcus again?\n\n\"What? What? Huh? What is it?\" he exclaimed in perplexity, looking from\none to the other.\n\n\"Come on, you must rastle me again,\" shouted Marcus.\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" cried the dentist. \"I'll rastle you again. I'll rastle\neverybody,\" he cried, suddenly struck with an idea. Trina looked on in\nsome apprehension.\n\n\"Mark gets so mad,\" she said, half aloud.\n\n\"Yes,\" admitted Selina. \"Mister Schouler's got an awful quick temper,\nbut he ain't afraid of anything.\"\n\n\"All ready!\" shouted Ryer.\n\nThis time Marcus was more careful. Twice, as McTeague rushed at him, he\nslipped cleverly away. But as the dentist came in a third time, with his\nhead bowed, Marcus, raising himself to his full height, caught him with\nboth arms around the neck. The dentist gripped at him and rent away the\nsleeve of his shirt. There was a great laugh.\n\n\"Keep your shirt on,\" cried Mrs. Ryer.\n\nThe two men were grappling at each other wildly. The party could hear\nthem panting and grunting as they labored and struggled. Their boots\ntore up great clods of turf. Suddenly they came to the ground with a\ntremendous shock. But even as they were in the act of falling, Marcus,\nlike a very eel, writhed in the dentist's clasp and fell upon his side.\nMcTeague crashed down upon him like the collapse of a felled ox.\n\n\"Now, you gotta turn him on his back,\" shouted Heise to the dentist. \"He\nain't down if you don't.\"\n\nWith his huge salient chin digging into Marcus's shoulder, the dentist\nheaved and tugged. His face was flaming, his huge shock of yellow hair\nfell over his forehead, matted with sweat. Marcus began to yield despite\nhis frantic efforts. One shoulder was down, now the other began to go;\ngradually, gradually it was forced over. The little audience held its\nbreath in the suspense of the moment. Selina broke the silence, calling\nout shrilly:\n\n\"Ain't Doctor McTeague just that strong!\"\n\nMarcus heard it, and his fury came instantly to a head. Rage at his\ndefeat at the hands of the dentist and before Selina's eyes, the hate\nhe still bore his old-time \"pal\" and the impotent wrath of his own\npowerlessness were suddenly unleashed.\n\n\"God damn you! get off of me,\" he cried under his breath, spitting the\nwords as a snake spits its venom. The little audience uttered a cry.\nWith the oath Marcus had twisted his head and had bitten through the\nlobe of the dentist's ear. There was a sudden flash of bright-red blood.\n\nThen followed a terrible scene. The brute that in McTeague lay so close\nto the surface leaped instantly to life, monstrous, not to be resisted.\nHe sprang to his feet with a shrill and meaningless clamor, totally\nunlike the ordinary bass of his speaking tones. It was the hideous\nyelling of a hurt beast, the squealing of a wounded elephant. He\nframed no words; in the rush of high-pitched sound that issued from his\nwide-open mouth there was nothing articulate. It was something no longer\nhuman; it was rather an echo from the jungle.\n\nSluggish enough and slow to anger on ordinary occasions, McTeague when\nfinally aroused became another man. His rage was a kind of obsession, an\nevil mania, the drunkenness of passion, the exalted and perverted fury\nof the Berserker, blind and deaf, a thing insensate.\n\nAs he rose he caught Marcus's wrist in both his hands. He did not\nstrike, he did not know what he was doing. His only idea was to batter\nthe life out of the man before him, to crush and annihilate him upon the\ninstant. Gripping his enemy in his enormous hands, hard and knotted,\nand covered with a stiff fell of yellow hair--the hands of the old-time\ncar-boy--he swung him wide, as a hammer-thrower swings his hammer.\nMarcus's feet flipped from the ground, he spun through the air about\nMcTeague as helpless as a bundle of clothes. All at once there was a\nsharp snap, almost like the report of a small pistol. Then Marcus rolled\nover and over upon the ground as McTeague released his grip; his arm,\nthe one the dentist had seized, bending suddenly, as though a third\njoint had formed between wrist and elbow. The arm was broken.\n\nBut by this time every one was crying out at once. Heise and Ryan ran in\nbetween the two men. Selina turned her head away. Trina was wringing her\nhands and crying in an agony of dread:\n\n\"Oh, stop them, stop them! Don't let them fight. Oh, it's too awful.\"\n\n\"Here, here, Doc, quit. Don't make a fool of yourself,\" cried Heise,\nclinging to the dentist. \"That's enough now. LISTEN to me, will you?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mac, Mac,\" cried Trina, running to her husband. \"Mac, dear, listen;\nit's me, it's Trina, look at me, you----\"\n\n\"Get hold of his other arm, will you, Ryer?\" panted Heise. \"Quick!\"\n\n\"Mac, Mac,\" cried Trina, her arms about his neck.\n\n\"For God's sake, hold up, Doc, will you?\" shouted the harness-maker.\n\"You don't want to kill him, do you?\"\n\nMrs. Ryer and Heise's lame wife were filling the air with their\noutcries. Selina was giggling with hysteria. Marcus, terrified, but too\nbrave to run, had picked up a jagged stone with his left hand and stood\non the defensive. His swollen right arm, from which the shirt sleeve had\nbeen torn, dangled at his side, the back of the hand twisted where the\npalm should have been. The shirt itself was a mass of grass stains and\nwas spotted with the dentist's blood.\n\nBut McTeague, in the centre of the group that struggled to hold him, was\nnigh to madness. The side of his face, his neck, and all the shoulder\nand breast of his shirt were covered with blood. He had ceased to cry\nout, but kept muttering between his gripped jaws, as he labored to tear\nhimself free of the retaining hands:\n\n\"Ah, I'll kill him! Ah, I'll kill him! I'll kill him! Damn you, Heise,\"\nhe exclaimed suddenly, trying to strike the harness-maker, \"let go of\nme, will you!\"\n\nLittle by little they pacified him, or rather (for he paid but little\nattention to what was said to him) his bestial fury lapsed by degrees.\nHe turned away and let fall his arms, drawing long breaths, and looking\nstupidly about him, now searching helplessly upon the ground, now gazing\nvaguely into the circle of faces about him. His ear bled as though it\nwould never stop.\n\n\"Say, Doctor,\" asked Heise, \"what's the best thing to do?\"\n\n\"Huh?\" answered McTeague. \"What--what do you mean? What is it?\"\n\n\"What'll we do to stop this bleeding here?\"\n\nMcTeague did not answer, but looked intently at the blood-stained bosom\nof his shirt.\n\n\"Mac,\" cried Trina, her face close to his, \"tell us something--the best\nthing we can do to stop your ear bleeding.\"\n\n\"Collodium,\" said the dentist.\n\n\"But we can't get to that right away; we--\"\n\n\"There's some ice in our lunch basket,\" broke in Heise. \"We brought it\nfor the beer; and take the napkins and make a bandage.\"\n\n\"Ice,\" muttered the dentist, \"sure, ice, that's the word.\"\n\nMrs. Heise and the Ryers were looking after Marcus's broken arm. Selina\nsat on the slope of the grass, gasping and sobbing. Trina tore the\nnapkins into strips, and, crushing some of the ice, made a bandage for\nher husband's head.'\n\nThe party resolved itself into two groups; the Ryers and Mrs. Heise\nbending over Marcus, while the harness-maker and Trina came and went\nabout McTeague, sitting on the ground, his shirt, a mere blur of red\nand white, detaching itself violently from the background of pale-green\ngrass. Between the two groups was the torn and trampled bit of turf, the\nwrestling ring; the picnic baskets, together with empty beer bottles,\nbroken egg-shells, and discarded sardine tins, were scattered here and\nthere. In the middle of the improvised wrestling ring the sleeve of\nMarcus's shirt fluttered occasionally in the sea breeze.\n\nNobody was paying any attention to Selina. All at once she began to\ngiggle hysterically again, then cried out with a peal of laughter:\n\n\"Oh, what a way for our picnic to end!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 12\n\n\n\"Now, then, Maria,\" said Zerkow, his cracked, strained voice just rising\nabove a whisper, hitching his chair closer to the table, \"now, then, my\ngirl, let's have it all over again. Tell us about the gold plate--the\nservice. Begin with, 'There were over a hundred pieces and every one of\nthem gold.'\"\n\n\"I don't know what you're talking about, Zerkow,\" answered Maria. \"There\nnever was no gold plate, no gold service. I guess you must have dreamed\nit.\"\n\nMaria and the red-headed Polish Jew had been married about a month after\nthe McTeague's picnic which had ended in such lamentable fashion. Zerkow\nhad taken Maria home to his wretched hovel in the alley back of the\nflat, and the flat had been obliged to get another maid of all work.\nTime passed, a month, six months, a whole year went by. At length Maria\ngave birth to a child, a wretched, sickly child, with not even strength\nenough nor wits enough to cry. At the time of its birth Maria was out of\nher mind, and continued in a state of dementia for nearly ten days. She\nrecovered just in time to make the arrangements for the baby's burial.\nNeither Zerkow nor Maria was much affected by either the birth or the\ndeath of this little child. Zerkow had welcomed it with pronounced\ndisfavor, since it had a mouth to be fed and wants to be provided for.\nMaria was out of her head so much of the time that she could scarcely\nremember how it looked when alive. The child was a mere incident in\ntheir lives, a thing that had come undesired and had gone unregretted.\nIt had not even a name; a strange, hybrid little being, come and gone\nwithin a fortnight's time, yet combining in its puny little body the\nblood of the Hebrew, the Pole, and the Spaniard.\n\nBut the birth of this child had peculiar consequences. Maria came out\nof her dementia, and in a few days the household settled itself again\nto its sordid regime and Maria went about her duties as usual. Then one\nevening, about a week after the child's burial, Zerkow had asked Maria\nto tell him the story of the famous service of gold plate for the\nhundredth time.\n\nZerkow had come to believe in this story infallibly. He was immovably\npersuaded that at one time Maria or Maria's people had possessed these\nhundred golden dishes. In his perverted mind the hallucination had\ndeveloped still further. Not only had that service of gold plate once\nexisted, but it existed now, entire, intact; not a single burnished\ngolden piece of it was missing. It was somewhere, somebody had it,\nlocked away in that leather trunk with its quilted lining and round\nbrass locks. It was to be searched for and secured, to be fought for,\nto be gained at all hazards. Maria must know where it was; by dint of\nquestioning, Zerkow would surely get the information from her. Some day,\nif only he was persistent, he would hit upon the right combination of\nquestions, the right suggestion that would disentangle Maria's confused\nrecollections. Maria would tell him where the thing was kept, was\nconcealed, was buried, and he would go to that place and secure it, and\nall that wonderful gold would be his forever and forever. This service\nof plate had come to be Zerkow's mania.\n\nOn this particular evening, about a week after the child's burial, in\nthe wretched back room of the Junk shop, Zerkow had made Maria sit down\nto the table opposite him--the whiskey bottle and the red glass tumbler\nwith its broken base between them--and had said:\n\n\"Now, then, Maria, tell us that story of the gold dishes again.\"\n\nMaria stared at him, an expression of perplexity coming into her face.\n\n\"What gold dishes?\" said she.\n\n\"The ones your people used to own in Central America. Come on, Maria,\nbegin, begin.\" The Jew craned himself forward, his lean fingers clawing\neagerly at his lips.\n\n\"What gold plate?\" said Maria, frowning at him as she drank her whiskey.\n\"What gold plate? I don' know what you're talking about, Zerkow.\"\n\nZerkow sat back in his chair, staring at her.\n\n\"Why, your people's gold dishes, what they used to eat off of. You've\ntold me about it a hundred times.\"\n\n\"You're crazy, Zerkow,\" said Maria. \"Push the bottle here, will you?\"\n\n\"Come, now,\" insisted Zerkow, sweating with desire, \"come, now, my girl,\ndon't be a fool; let's have it, let's have it. Begin now, 'There were\nmore'n a hundred pieces, and every one of 'em gold.' Oh, YOU know; come\non, come on.\"\n\n\"I don't remember nothing of the kind,\" protested Maria, reaching for\nthe bottle. Zerkow snatched it from her.\n\n\"You fool!\" he wheezed, trying to raise his broken voice to a shout.\n\"You fool! Don't you dare try an' cheat ME, or I'll DO for you. You know\nabout the gold plate, and you know where it is.\" Suddenly he pitched his\nvoice at the prolonged rasping shout with which he made his street cry.\nHe rose to his feet, his long, prehensile fingers curled into fists. He\nwas menacing, terrible in his rage. He leaned over Maria, his fists in\nher face.\n\n\"I believe you've got it!\" he yelled. \"I believe you've got it, an' are\nhiding it from me. Where is it, where is it? Is it here?\" he rolled his\neyes wildly about the room. \"Hey? hey?\" he went on, shaking Maria by the\nshoulders. \"Where is it? Is it here? Tell me where it is. Tell me, or\nI'll do for you!\"\n\n\"It ain't here,\" cried Maria, wrenching from him. \"It ain't anywhere.\nWhat gold plate? What are you talking about? I don't remember nothing\nabout no gold plate at all.\"\n\nNo, Maria did not remember. The trouble and turmoil of her mind\nconsequent upon the birth of her child seemed to have readjusted her\ndisordered ideas upon this point. Her mania had come to a crisis, which\nin subsiding had cleared her brain of its one illusion. She did not\nremember. Or it was possible that the gold plate she had once remembered\nhad had some foundation in fact, that her recital of its splendors had\nbeen truth, sound and sane. It was possible that now her FORGETFULNESS\nof it was some form of brain trouble, a relic of the dementia of\nchildbirth. At all events Maria did not remember; the idea of the gold\nplate had passed entirely out of her mind, and it was now Zerkow who\nlabored under its hallucination. It was now Zerkow, the raker of the\ncity's muck heap, the searcher after gold, that saw that wonderful\nservice in the eye of his perverted mind. It was he who could now\ndescribe it in a language almost eloquent. Maria had been content merely\nto remember it; but Zerkow's avarice goaded him to a belief that it was\nstill in existence, hid somewhere, perhaps in that very house, stowed\naway there by Maria. For it stood to reason, didn't it, that Maria could\nnot have described it with such wonderful accuracy and such careful\ndetail unless she had seen it recently--the day before, perhaps, or that\nvery day, or that very hour, that very HOUR?\n\n\"Look out for yourself,\" he whispered, hoarsely, to his wife. \"Look out\nfor yourself, my girl. I'll hunt for it, and hunt for it, and hunt for\nit, and some day I'll find it--I will, you'll see--I'll find it, I'll\nfind it; and if I don't, I'll find a way that'll make you tell me where\nit is. I'll make you speak--believe me, I will, I will, my girl--trust\nme for that.\"\n\nAnd at night Maria would sometimes wake to find Zerkow gone from the\nbed, and would see him burrowing into some corner by the light of his\ndark-lantern and would hear him mumbling to himself: \"There were more'n\na hundred pieces, and every one of 'em gold--when the leather trunk was\nopened it fair dazzled your eyes--why, just that punchbowl was worth a\nfortune, I guess; solid, solid, heavy, rich, pure gold, nothun but gold,\ngold, heaps and heaps of it--what a glory! I'll find it yet, I'll find\nit. It's here somewheres, hid somewheres in this house.\"\n\nAt length his continued ill success began to exasperate him. One day he\ntook his whip from his junk wagon and thrashed Maria with it, gasping\nthe while, \"Where is it, you beast? Where is it? Tell me where it is;\nI'll make you speak.\"\n\n\"I don' know, I don' know,\" cried Maria, dodging his blows. \"I'd tell\nyou, Zerkow, if I knew; but I don' know nothing about it. How can I tell\nyou if I don' know?\"\n\nThen one evening matters reached a crisis. Marcus Schouler was in his\nroom, the room in the flat just over McTeague's \"Parlors\" which he had\nalways occupied. It was between eleven and twelve o'clock. The vast\nhouse was quiet; Polk Street outside was very still, except for the\noccasional whirr and trundle of a passing cable car and the persistent\ncalling of ducks and geese in the deserted market directly opposite.\nMarcus was in his shirt sleeves, perspiring and swearing with exertion\nas he tried to get all his belongings into an absurdly inadequate trunk.\nThe room was in great confusion. It looked as though Marcus was about\nto move. He stood in front of his trunk, his precious silk hat in its\nhat-box in his hand. He was raging at the perverseness of a pair of\nboots that refused to fit in his trunk, no matter how he arranged them.\n\n\"I've tried you SO, and I've tried you SO,\" he exclaimed fiercely,\nbetween his teeth, \"and you won't go.\" He began to swear horribly,\ngrabbing at the boots with his free hand. \"Pretty soon I won't take you\nat all; I won't, for a fact.\"\n\nHe was interrupted by a rush of feet upon the back stairs and a\nclamorous pounding upon his door. He opened it to let in Maria Macapa,\nher hair dishevelled and her eyes starting with terror.\n\n\"Oh, MISTER Schouler,\" she gasped, \"lock the door quick. Don't let him\nget me. He's got a knife, and he says sure he's going to do for me, if I\ndon't tell him where it is.\"\n\n\"Who has? What has? Where is what?\" shouted Marcus, flaming with\nexcitement upon the instant. He opened the door and peered down the dark\nhall, both fists clenched, ready to fight--he did not know whom, and he\ndid not know why.\n\n\"It's Zerkow,\" wailed Maria, pulling him back into the room and bolting\nthe door, \"and he's got a knife as long as THAT. Oh, my Lord, here he\ncomes now! Ain't that him? Listen.\"\n\nZerkow was coming up the stairs, calling for Maria.\n\n\"Don't you let him get me, will you, Mister Schouler?\" gasped Maria.\n\n\"I'll break him in two,\" shouted Marcus, livid with rage. \"Think I'm\nafraid of his knife?\"\n\n\"I know where you are,\" cried Zerkow, on the landing outside. \"You're in\nSchouler's room. What are you doing in Schouler's room at this time of\nnight? Come outa there; you oughta be ashamed. I'll do for you yet, my\ngirl. Come outa there once, an' see if I don't.\"\n\n\"I'll do for you myself, you dirty Jew,\" shouted Marcus, unbolting the\ndoor and running out into the hall.\n\n\"I want my wife,\" exclaimed the Jew, backing down the stairs. \"What's\nshe mean by running away from me and going into your room?\"\n\n\"Look out, he's got a knife!\" cried Maria through the crack of the door.\n\n\"Ah, there you are. Come outa that, and come back home,\" exclaimed\nZerkow.\n\n\"Get outa here yourself,\" cried Marcus, advancing on him angrily. \"Get\nouta here.\"\n\n\"Maria's gota come too.\"\n\n\"Get outa here,\" vociferated Marcus, \"an' put up that knife. I see it;\nyou needn't try an' hide it behind your leg. Give it to me, anyhow,\" he\nshouted suddenly, and before Zerkow was aware, Marcus had wrenched it\naway. \"Now, get outa here.\"\n\nZerkow backed away, peering and peeping over Marcus's shoulder.\n\n\"I want Maria.\"\n\n\"Get outa here. Get along out, or I'll PUT you out.\" The street door\nclosed. The Jew was gone.\n\n\"Huh!\" snorted Marcus, swelling with arrogance. \"Huh! Think I'm afraid\nof his knife? I ain't afraid of ANYBODY,\" he shouted pointedly, for\nMcTeague and his wife, roused by the clamor, were peering over the\nbanisters from the landing above. \"Not of anybody,\" repeated Marcus.\n\nMaria came out into the hall.\n\n\"Is he gone? Is he sure gone?\"\n\n\"What was the trouble?\" inquired Marcus, suddenly.\n\n\"I woke up about an hour ago,\" Maria explained, \"and Zerkow wasn't in\nbed; maybe he hadn't come to bed at all. He was down on his knees by the\nsink, and he'd pried up some boards off the floor and was digging there.\nHe had his dark-lantern. He was digging with that knife, I guess, and\nall the time he kept mumbling to himself, 'More'n a hundred pieces, an'\nevery one of 'em gold; more'n a hundred pieces, an' every one of 'em\ngold.' Then, all of a sudden, he caught sight of me. I was sitting up in\nbed, and he jumped up and came at me with his knife, an' he says, 'Where\nis it? Where is it? I know you got it hid somewhere. Where is it? Tell\nme or I'll knife you.' I kind of fooled him and kept him off till I got\nmy wrapper on, an' then I run out. I didn't dare stay.\"\n\n\"Well, what did you tell him about your gold dishes for in the first\nplace?\" cried Marcus.\n\n\"I never told him,\" protested Maria, with the greatest energy. \"I never\ntold him; I never heard of any gold dishes. I don' know where he got the\nidea; he must be crazy.\"\n\nBy this time Trina and McTeague, Old Grannis, and little Miss Baker--all\nthe lodgers on the upper floors of the flat--had gathered about Maria.\nTrina and the dentist, who had gone to bed, were partially dressed, and\nTrina's enormous mane of black hair was hanging in two thick braids\nfar down her back. But, late as it was, Old Grannis and the retired\ndressmaker had still been up and about when Maria had aroused them.\n\n\"Why, Maria,\" said Trina, \"you always used to tell us about your gold\ndishes. You said your folks used to have them.\"\n\n\"Never, never, never!\" exclaimed Maria, vehemently. \"You folks must all\nbe crazy. I never HEARD of any gold dishes.\"\n\n\"Well,\" spoke up Miss Baker, \"you're a queer girl, Maria; that's all\nI can say.\" She left the group and returned to her room. Old Grannis\nwatched her go from the corner of his eye, and in a few moments followed\nher, leaving the group as unnoticed as he had joined it. By degrees the\nflat quieted down again. Trina and McTeague returned to their rooms.\n\n\"I guess I'll go back now,\" said Maria. \"He's all right now. I ain't\nafraid of him so long as he ain't got his knife.\"\n\n\"Well, say,\" Marcus called to her as she went down stairs, \"if he gets\nfunny again, you just yell out; I'LL hear you. I won't let him hurt\nyou.\"\n\nMarcus went into his room again and resumed his wrangle with the\nrefractory boots. His eye fell on Zerkow's knife, a long, keen-bladed\nhunting-knife, with a buckhorn handle. \"I'll take you along with me,\" he\nexclaimed, suddenly. \"I'll just need you where I'm going.\"\n\nMeanwhile, old Miss Baker was making tea to calm her nerves after the\nexcitement of Maria's incursion. This evening she went so far as to\nmake tea for two, laying an extra place on the other side of her little\ntea-table, setting out a cup and saucer and one of the Gorham silver\nspoons. Close upon the other side of the partition Old Grannis bound\nuncut numbers of the \"Nation.\"\n\n\"Do you know what I think, Mac?\" said Trina, when the couple had\nreturned to their rooms. \"I think Marcus is going away.\"\n\n\"What? What?\" muttered the dentist, very sleepy and stupid, \"what you\nsaying? What's that about Marcus?\"\n\n\"I believe Marcus has been packing up, the last two or three days. I\nwonder if he's going away.\"\n\n\"Who's going away?\" said McTeague, blinking at her.\n\n\"Oh, go to bed,\" said Trina, pushing him goodnaturedly. \"Mac, you're the\nstupidest man I ever knew.\"\n\nBut it was true. Marcus was going away. Trina received a letter the next\nmorning from her mother. The carpet-cleaning and upholstery business in\nwhich Mr. Sieppe had involved himself was going from bad to worse. Mr.\nSieppe had even been obliged to put a mortgage upon their house. Mrs.\nSieppe didn't know what was to become of them all. Her husband had even\nbegun to talk of emigrating to New Zealand. Meanwhile, she informed\nTrina that Mr. Sieppe had finally come across a man with whom Marcus\ncould \"go in with on a ranch,\" a cattle ranch in the southeastern\nportion of the State. Her ideas were vague upon the subject, but she\nknew that Marcus was wildly enthusiastic at the prospect, and was\nexpected down before the end of the month. In the meantime, could Trina\nsend them fifty dollars?\n\n\"Marcus IS going away, after all, Mac,\" said Trina to her husband\nthat day as he came out of his \"Parlors\" and sat down to the lunch of\nsausages, mashed potatoes, and chocolate in the sitting-room.\n\n\"Huh?\" said the dentist, a little confused. \"Who's going away? Schouler\ngoing away? Why's Schouler going away?\"\n\nTrina explained. \"Oh!\" growled McTeague, behind his thick mustache, \"he\ncan go far before I'LL stop him.\"\n\n\"And, say, Mac,\" continued Trina, pouring the chocolate, \"what do you\nthink? Mamma wants me--wants us to send her fifty dollars. She says\nthey're hard up.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the dentist, after a moment, \"well, I guess we can send it,\ncan't we?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's easy to say,\" complained Trina, her little chin in the\nair, her small pale lips pursed. \"I wonder if mamma thinks we're\nmillionaires?\"\n\n\"Trina, you're getting to be regular stingy,\" muttered McTeague. \"You're\ngetting worse and worse every day.\"\n\n\"But fifty dollars is fifty dollars, Mac. Just think how long it takes\nyou to earn fifty dollars. Fifty dollars! That's two months of our\ninterest.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said McTeague, easily, his mouth full of mashed potato, \"you got\na lot saved up.\"\n\nUpon every reference to that little hoard in the brass match-safe\nand chamois-skin bag at the bottom of her trunk, Trina bridled on the\ninstant.\n\n\"Don't TALK that way, Mac. 'A lot of money.' What do you call a lot of\nmoney? I don't believe I've got fifty dollars saved.\"\n\n\"Hoh!\" exclaimed McTeague. \"Hoh! I guess you got nearer a hundred AN'\nfifty. That's what I guess YOU got.\"\n\n\"I've NOT, I've NOT,\" declared Trina, \"and you know I've not. I wish\nmamma hadn't asked me for any money. Why can't she be a little more\neconomical? I manage all right. No, no, I can't possibly afford to send\nher fifty.\"\n\n\"Oh, pshaw! What WILL you do, then?\" grumbled her husband.\n\n\"I'll send her twenty-five this month, and tell her I'll send the rest\nas soon as I can afford it.\"\n\n\"Trina, you're a regular little miser,\" said McTeague.\n\n\"I don't care,\" answered Trina, beginning to laugh. \"I guess I am, but I\ncan't help it, and it's a good fault.\"\n\nTrina put off sending this money for a couple of weeks, and her mother\nmade no mention of it in her next letter. \"Oh, I guess if she wants\nit so bad,\" said Trina, \"she'll speak about it again.\" So she again\npostponed the sending of it. Day by day she put it off. When her mother\nasked her for it a second time, it seemed harder than ever for Trina to\npart with even half the sum requested. She answered her mother, telling\nher that they were very hard up themselves for that month, but that she\nwould send down the amount in a few weeks.\n\n\"I'll tell you what we'll do, Mac,\" she said to her husband, \"you send\nhalf and I'll send half; we'll send twenty-five dollars altogether.\nTwelve and a half apiece. That's an idea. How will that do?\"\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" McTeague had answered, giving her the money. Trina sent\nMcTeague's twelve dollars, but never sent the twelve that was to be her\nshare. One day the dentist happened to ask her about it.\n\n\"You sent that twenty-five to your mother, didn't you?\" said he.\n\n\"Oh, long ago,\" answered Trina, without thinking.\n\nIn fact, Trina never allowed herself to think very much of this affair.\nAnd, in fact, another matter soon came to engross her attention.\n\nOne Sunday evening Trina and her husband were in their sitting-room\ntogether. It was dark, but the lamp had not been lit. McTeague had\nbrought up some bottles of beer from the \"Wein Stube\" on the ground\nfloor, where the branch post-office used to be. But they had not\nopened the beer. It was a warm evening in summer. Trina was sitting on\nMcTeague's lap in the bay window, and had looped back the Nottingham\ncurtains so the two could look out into the darkened street and watch\nthe moon coming up over the glass roof of the huge public baths. On\noccasions they sat like this for an hour or so, \"philandering,\" Trina\ncuddling herself down upon McTeague's enormous body, rubbing her cheek\nagainst the grain of his unshaven chin, kissing the bald spot on the top\nof his head, or putting her fingers into his ears and eyes. At times,\na brusque access of passion would seize upon her, and, with a nervous\nlittle sigh, she would clasp his thick red neck in both her small arms\nand whisper in his ear:\n\n\"Do you love me, Mac, dear? Love me BIG, BIG? Sure, do you love me as\nmuch as you did when we were married?\"\n\nPuzzled, McTeague would answer: \"Well, you know it, don't you, Trina?\"\n\n\"But I want you to SAY so; say so always and always.\"\n\n\"Well, I do, of course I do.\"\n\n\"Say it, then.\"\n\n\"Well, then, I love you.\"\n\n\"But you don't say it of your own accord.\"\n\n\"Well, what--what--what--I don't understand,\" stammered the dentist,\nbewildered.\n\nThere was a knock on the door. Confused and embarrassed, as if they were\nnot married, Trina scrambled off McTeague's lap, hastening to light the\nlamp, whispering, \"Put on your coat, Mac, and smooth your hair,\" and\nmaking gestures for him to put the beer bottles out of sight. She opened\nthe door and uttered an exclamation.\n\n\"Why, Cousin Mark!\" she said. McTeague glared at him, struck speechless,\nconfused beyond expression. Marcus Schouler, perfectly at his ease,\nstood in the doorway, smiling with great affability.\n\n\"Say,\" he remarked, \"can I come in?\"\n\nTaken all aback, Trina could only answer:\n\n\"Why--I suppose so. Yes, of course--come in.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, come in,\" exclaimed the dentist, suddenly, speaking without\nthought. \"Have some beer?\" he added, struck with an idea.\n\n\"No, thanks, Doctor,\" said Marcus, pleasantly.\n\nMcTeague and Trina were puzzled. What could it all mean? Did Marcus\nwant to become reconciled to his enemy? \"I know.\" Trina said to herself.\n\"He's going away, and he wants to borrow some money. He won't get a\npenny, not a penny.\" She set her teeth together hard.\n\n\"Well,\" said Marcus, \"how's business, Doctor?\"\n\n\"Oh,\" said McTeague, uneasily, \"oh, I don' know. I guess--I guess,\"\nhe broke off in helpless embarrassment. They had all sat down by now.\nMarcus continued, holding his hat and his cane--the black wand of ebony\nwith the gold top presented to him by the \"Improvement Club.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said he, wagging his head and looking about the sitting-room, \"you\npeople have got the best fixed rooms in the whole flat. Yes, sir; you\nhave, for a fact.\" He glanced from the lithograph framed in gilt and red\nplush--the two little girls at their prayers--to the \"I'm Grandpa\"\nand \"I'm Grandma\" pictures, noted the clean white matting and the gay\nworsted tidies over the chair backs, and appeared to contemplate in\necstasy the framed photograph of McTeague and Trina in their wedding\nfinery.\n\n\"Well, you two are pretty happy together, ain't you?\" said he, smiling\ngood-humoredly.\n\n\"Oh, we don't complain,\" answered Trina.\n\n\"Plenty of money, lots to do, everything fine, hey?\"\n\n\"We've got lots to do,\" returned Trina, thinking to head him off, \"but\nwe've not got lots of money.\"\n\nBut evidently Marcus wanted no money.\n\n\"Well, Cousin Trina,\" he said, rubbing his knee, \"I'm going away.\"\n\n\"Yes, mamma wrote me; you're going on a ranch.\"\n\n\"I'm going in ranching with an English duck,\" corrected Marcus. \"Mr.\nSieppe has fixed things. We'll see if we can't raise some cattle. I know\na lot about horses, and he's ranched some before--this English duck. And\nthen I'm going to keep my eye open for a political chance down there. I\ngot some introductions from the President of the Improvement Club. I'll\nwork things somehow, oh, sure.\"\n\n\"How long you going to be gone?\" asked Trina.\n\nMarcus stared.\n\n\"Why, I ain't EVER coming back,\" he vociferated. \"I'm going to-morrow,\nand I'm going for good. I come to say good-by.\"\n\nMarcus stayed for upwards of an hour that evening. He talked on easily\nand agreeably, addressing himself as much to McTeague as to Trina. At\nlast he rose.\n\n\"Well, good-by, Doc.\"\n\n\"Good-by, Marcus,\" returned McTeague. The two shook hands.\n\n\"Guess we won't ever see each other again,\" continued Marcus. \"But good\nluck to you, Doc. Hope some day you'll have the patients standing in\nline on the stairs.\"\n\n\"Huh! I guess so, I guess so,\" said the dentist.\n\n\"Good-by, Cousin Trina.\"\n\n\"Good-by, Marcus,\" answered Trina. \"You be sure to remember me to mamma,\nand papa, and everybody. I'm going to make two great big sets of Noah's\nark animals for the twins on their next birthday; August is too old\nfor toys. But you can tell the twins that I'll make them some great big\nanimals. Good-by, success to you, Marcus.\"\n\n\"Good-by, good-by. Good luck to you both.\"\n\n\"Good-by, Cousin Mark.\"\n\n\"Good-by, Marcus.\"\n\nHe was gone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 13\n\n\nOne morning about a week after Marcus had left for the southern part\nof the State, McTeague found an oblong letter thrust through the\nletter-drop of the door of his \"Parlors.\" The address was typewritten.\nHe opened it. The letter had been sent from the City Hall and was\nstamped in one corner with the seal of the State of California, very\nofficial; the form and file numbers superscribed.\n\nMcTeague had been making fillings when this letter arrived. He was in\nhis \"Parlors,\" pottering over his movable rack underneath the bird cage\nin the bay window. He was making \"blocks\" to be used in large proximal\ncavities and \"cylinders\" for commencing fillings. He heard the postman's\nstep in the hall and saw the envelopes begin to shuttle themselves\nthrough the slit of his letter-drop. Then came the fat oblong envelope,\nwith its official seal, that dropped flatwise to the floor with a\nsodden, dull impact.\n\nThe dentist put down the broach and scissors and gathered up his mail.\nThere were four letters altogether. One was for Trina, in Selina's\n\"elegant\" handwriting; another was an advertisement of a new kind of\noperating chair for dentists; the third was a card from a milliner on\nthe next block, announcing an opening; and the fourth, contained in the\nfat oblong envelope, was a printed form with blanks left for names\nand dates, and addressed to McTeague, from an office in the City Hall.\nMcTeague read it through laboriously. \"I don' know, I don' know,\" he\nmuttered, looking stupidly at the rifle manufacturer's calendar. Then\nhe heard Trina, from the kitchen, singing as she made a clattering\nnoise with the breakfast dishes. \"I guess I'll ask Trina about it,\" he\nmuttered.\n\nHe went through the suite, by the sitting-room, where the sun was\npouring in through the looped backed Nottingham curtains upon the clean\nwhite matting and the varnished surface of the melodeon, passed on\nthrough the bedroom, with its framed lithographs of round-cheeked\nEnglish babies and alert fox terriers, and came out into the brick-paved\nkitchen. The kitchen was clean as a new whistle; the freshly blackened\ncook stove glowed like a negro's hide; the tins and porcelain-lined\nstew-pans might have been of silver and of ivory. Trina was in the\ncentre of the room, wiping off, with a damp sponge, the oilcloth\ntable-cover, on which they had breakfasted. Never had she looked so\npretty. Early though it was, her enormous tiara of swarthy hair was\nneatly combed and coiled, not a pin was so much as loose. She wore a\nblue calico skirt with a white figure, and a belt of imitation alligator\nskin clasped around her small, firmly-corseted waist; her shirt\nwaist was of pink linen, so new and crisp that it crackled with every\nmovement, while around the collar, tied in a neat knot, was one of\nMcTeague's lawn ties which she had appropriated. Her sleeves were\ncarefully rolled up almost to her shoulders, and nothing could have been\nmore delicious than the sight of her small round arms, white as milk,\nmoving back and forth as she sponged the table-cover, a faint touch of\npink coming and going at the elbows as they bent and straightened. She\nlooked up quickly as her husband entered, her narrow eyes alight, her\nadorable little chin in the air; her lips rounded and opened with the\nlast words of her song, so that one could catch a glint of gold in the\nfillings of her upper teeth.\n\nThe whole scene--the clean kitchen and its clean brick floor; the smell\nof coffee that lingered in the air; Trina herself, fresh as if from\na bath, and singing at her work; the morning sun, striking obliquely\nthrough the white muslin half-curtain of the window and spanning the\nlittle kitchen with a bridge of golden mist--gave off, as it were, a\nnote of gayety that was not to be resisted. Through the opened top of\nthe window came the noises of Polk Street, already long awake. One heard\nthe chanting of street cries, the shrill calling of children on their\nway to school, the merry rattle of a butcher's cart, the brisk noise\nof hammering, or the occasional prolonged roll of a cable car trundling\nheavily past, with a vibrant whirring of its jostled glass and the\njoyous clanging of its bells.\n\n\"What is it, Mac, dear?\" said Trina.\n\nMcTeague shut the door behind him with his heel and handed her the\nletter. Trina read it through. Then suddenly her small hand gripped\ntightly upon the sponge, so that the water started from it and dripped\nin a little pattering deluge upon the bricks.\n\nThe letter--or rather printed notice--informed McTeague that he had\nnever received a diploma from a dental college, and that in consequence\nhe was forbidden to practise his profession any longer. A legal extract\nbearing upon the case was attached in small type.\n\n\"Why, what's all this?\" said Trina, calmly, without thought as yet.\n\n\"I don' know, I don' know,\" answered her husband.\n\n\"You can't practise any longer,\" continued Trina,--\"'is herewith\nprohibited and enjoined from further continuing----'\" She re-read\nthe extract, her forehead lifting and puckering. She put the sponge\ncarefully away in its wire rack over the sink, and drew up a chair to\nthe table, spreading out the notice before her. \"Sit down,\" she said to\nMcTeague. \"Draw up to the table here, Mac, and let's see what this is.\"\n\n\"I got it this morning,\" murmured the dentist. \"It just now came. I was\nmaking some fillings--there, in the 'Parlors,' in the window--and the\npostman shoved it through the door. I thought it was a number of the\n'American System of Dentistry' at first, and when I'd opened it and\nlooked at it I thought I'd better----\"\n\n\"Say, Mac,\" interrupted Trina, looking up from the notice, \"DIDN'T you\never go to a dental college?\"\n\n\"Huh? What? What?\" exclaimed McTeague.\n\n\"How did you learn to be a dentist? Did you go to a college?\"\n\n\"I went along with a fellow who came to the mine once. My mother sent\nme. We used to go from one camp to another. I sharpened his excavators\nfor him, and put up his notices in the towns--stuck them up in the\npost-offices and on the doors of the Odd Fellows' halls. He had a\nwagon.\"\n\n\"But didn't you never go to a college?\"\n\n\"Huh? What? College? No, I never went. I learned from the fellow.\"\n\nTrina rolled down her sleeves. She was a little paler than usual. She\nfastened the buttons into the cuffs and said:\n\n\"But do you know you can't practise unless you're graduated from a\ncollege? You haven't the right to call yourself, 'doctor.'\"\n\nMcTeague stared a moment; then:\n\n\"Why, I've been practising ten years. More--nearly twelve.\"\n\n\"But it's the law.\"\n\n\"What's the law?\"\n\n\"That you can't practise, or call yourself doctor, unless you've got a\ndiploma.\"\n\n\"What's that--a diploma?\"\n\n\"I don't know exactly. It's a kind of paper that--that--oh, Mac, we're\nruined.\" Trina's voice rose to a cry.\n\n\"What do you mean, Trina? Ain't I a dentist? Ain't I a doctor? Look\nat my sign, and the gold tooth you gave me. Why, I've been practising\nnearly twelve years.\"\n\nTrina shut her lips tightly, cleared her throat, and pretended to\nresettle a hair-pin at the back of her head.\n\n\"I guess it isn't as bad as that,\" she said, very quietly. \"Let's\nread this again. 'Herewith prohibited and enjoined from further\ncontinuing----'\" She read to the end.\n\n\"Why, it isn't possible,\" she cried. \"They can't mean--oh, Mac, I do\nbelieve--pshaw!\" she exclaimed, her pale face flushing. \"They don't\nknow how good a dentist you are. What difference does a diploma make, if\nyou're a first-class dentist? I guess that's all right. Mac, didn't you\never go to a dental college?\"\n\n\"No,\" answered McTeague, doggedly. \"What was the good? I learned how to\noperate; wa'n't that enough?\"\n\n\"Hark,\" said Trina, suddenly. \"Wasn't that the bell of your office?\"\nThey had both heard the jangling of the bell that McTeague had hung over\nthe door of his \"Parlors.\" The dentist looked at the kitchen clock.\n\n\"That's Vanovitch,\" said he. \"He's a plumber round on Sutter Street.\nHe's got an appointment with me to have a bicuspid pulled. I got to go\nback to work.\" He rose.\n\n\"But you can't,\" cried Trina, the back of her hand upon her lips, her\neyes brimming. \"Mac, don't you see? Can't you understand? You've got to\nstop. Oh, it's dreadful! Listen.\" She hurried around the table to him\nand caught his arm in both her hands.\n\n\"Huh?\" growled McTeague, looking at her with a puzzled frown.\n\n\"They'll arrest you. You'll go to prison. You can't work--can't work any\nmore. We're ruined.\"\n\nVanovitch was pounding on the door of the sitting-room.\n\n\"He'll be gone in a minute,\" exclaimed McTeague.\n\n\"Well, let him go. Tell him to go; tell him to come again.\"\n\n\"Why, he's got an APPOINTMENT with me,\" exclaimed McTeague, his hand\nupon the door.\n\nTrina caught him back. \"But, Mac, you ain't a dentist any longer; you\nain't a doctor. You haven't the right to work. You never went to a\ndental college.\"\n\n\"Well, suppose I never went to a college, ain't I a dentist just the\nsame? Listen, he's pounding there again. No, I'm going, sure.\"\n\n\"Well, of course, go,\" said Trina, with sudden reaction. \"It ain't\npossible they'll make you stop. If you're a good dentist, that's all\nthat's wanted. Go on, Mac; hurry, before he goes.\"\n\nMcTeague went out, closing the door. Trina stood for a moment looking\nintently at the bricks at her feet. Then she returned to the table,\nand sat down again before the notice, and, resting her head in both her\nfists, read it yet another time. Suddenly the conviction seized upon her\nthat it was all true. McTeague would be obliged to stop work, no matter\nhow good a dentist he was. But why had the authorities at the City Hall\nwaited this long before serving the notice? All at once Trina snapped\nher fingers, with a quick flash of intelligence.\n\n\"It's Marcus that's done it,\" she cried.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt was like a clap of thunder. McTeague was stunned, stupefied. He said\nnothing. Never in his life had he been so taciturn. At times he did not\nseem to hear Trina when she spoke to him, and often she had to shake\nhim by the shoulder to arouse his attention. He would sit apart in his\n\"Parlors,\" turning the notice about in his enormous clumsy fingers,\nreading it stupidly over and over again. He couldn't understand. What\nhad a clerk at the City Hall to do with him? Why couldn't they let him\nalone?\n\n\"Oh, what's to become of us NOW?\" wailed Trina. \"What's to become of us\nnow? We're paupers, beggars--and all so sudden.\" And once, in a quick,\ninexplicable fury, totally unlike anything that McTeague had noticed in\nher before, she had started up, with fists and teeth shut tight, and\nhad cried, \"Oh, if you'd only KILLED Marcus Schouler that time he fought\nyou!\"\n\nMcTeague had continued his work, acting from sheer force of habit; his\nsluggish, deliberate nature, methodical, obstinate, refusing to adapt\nitself to the new conditions.\n\n\"Maybe Marcus was only trying to scare us,\" Trina had said. \"How are\nthey going to know whether you're practising or not?\"\n\n\"I got a mould to make to-morrow,\" McTeague said, \"and Vanovitch, that\nplumber round on Sutter Street, he's coming again at three.\"\n\n\"Well, you go right ahead,\" Trina told him, decisively; \"you go right\nahead and make the mould, and pull every tooth in Vanovitch's head if\nyou want to. Who's going to know? Maybe they just sent that notice as a\nmatter of form. Maybe Marcus got that paper and filled it in himself.\"\n\nThe two would lie awake all night long, staring up into the dark,\ntalking, talking, talking.\n\n\"Haven't you got any right to practise if you've not been to a dental\ncollege, Mac? Didn't you ever go?\" Trina would ask again and again.\n\n\"No, no,\" answered the dentist, \"I never went. I learnt from the fellow\nI was apprenticed to. I don' know anything about a dental college. Ain't\nI got a right to do as I like?\" he suddenly exclaimed.\n\n\"If you know your profession, isn't that enough?\" cried Trina.\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" growled McTeague. \"I ain't going to stop for them.\"\n\n\"You go right on,\" Trina said, \"and I bet you won't hear another word\nabout it.\"\n\n\"Suppose I go round to the City Hall and see them,\" hazarded McTeague.\n\n\"No, no, don't you do it, Mac,\" exclaimed Trina. \"Because, if Marcus has\ndone this just to scare you, they won't know anything about it there at\nthe City Hall; but they'll begin to ask you questions, and find out that\nyou never HAD graduated from a dental college, and you'd be just as bad\noff as ever.\"\n\n\"Well, I ain't going to quit for just a piece of paper,\" declared the\ndentist. The phrase stuck to him. All day long he went about their rooms\nor continued at his work in the \"Parlors,\" growling behind his thick\nmustache: \"I ain't going to quit for just a piece of paper. No, I ain't\ngoing to quit for just a piece of paper. Sure not.\"\n\nThe days passed, a week went by, McTeague continued his work as usual.\nThey heard no more from the City Hall, but the suspense of the situation\nwas harrowing. Trina was actually sick with it. The terror of the thing\nwas ever at their elbows, going to bed with them, sitting down with them\nat breakfast in the kitchen, keeping them company all through the day.\nTrina dared not think of what would be their fate if the income derived\nfrom McTeague's practice was suddenly taken from them. Then they would\nhave to fall back on the interest of her lottery money and the pittance\nshe derived from the manufacture of the Noah's ark animals, a little\nover thirty dollars a month. No, no, it was not to be thought of. It\ncould not be that their means of livelihood was to be thus stricken from\nthem.\n\nA fortnight went by. \"I guess we're all right, Mac,\" Trina allowed\nherself to say. \"It looks as though we were all right. How are they\ngoing to tell whether you're practising or not?\"\n\nThat day a second and much more peremptory notice was served upon\nMcTeague by an official in person. Then suddenly Trina was seized with a\npanic terror, unreasoned, instinctive. If McTeague persisted they would\nboth be sent to a prison, she was sure of it; a place where people were\nchained to the wall, in the dark, and fed on bread and water.\n\n\"Oh, Mac, you've got to quit,\" she wailed. \"You can't go on. They can\nmake you stop. Oh, why didn't you go to a dental college? Why didn't you\nfind out that you had to have a college degree? And now we're paupers,\nbeggars. We've got to leave here--leave this flat where I've been--where\nWE'VE been so happy, and sell all the pretty things; sell the pictures\nand the melodeon, and--Oh, it's too dreadful!\"\n\n\"Huh? Huh? What? What?\" exclaimed the dentist, bewildered. \"I ain't\ngoing to quit for just a piece of paper. Let them put me out. I'll show\nthem. They--they can't make small of me.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's all very fine to talk that way, but you'll have to quit.\"\n\n\"Well, we ain't paupers,\" McTeague suddenly exclaimed, an idea entering\nhis mind. \"We've got our money yet. You've got your five thousand\ndollars and the money you've been saving up. People ain't paupers when\nthey've got over five thousand dollars.\"\n\n\"What do you mean, Mac?\" cried Trina, apprehensively.\n\n\"Well, we can live on THAT money until--until--until--\" he broke off\nwith an uncertain movement of his shoulders, looking about him stupidly.\n\n\"Until WHEN?\" cried Trina. \"There ain't ever going to be any 'until.'\nWe've got the INTEREST of that five thousand and we've got what Uncle\nOelbermann gives me, a little over thirty dollars a month, and that's\nall we've got. You'll have to find something else to do.\"\n\n\"What will I find to do?\"\n\nWhat, indeed? McTeague was over thirty now, sluggish and slow-witted at\nbest. What new trade could he learn at this age?\n\nLittle by little Trina made the dentist understand the calamity that had\nbefallen them, and McTeague at last began cancelling his appointments.\nTrina gave it out that he was sick.\n\n\"Not a soul need know what's happened to us,\" she said to her husband.\n\nBut it was only by slow degrees that McTeague abandoned his profession.\nEvery morning after breakfast he would go into his \"Parlors\" as usual\nand potter about his instruments, his dental engine, and his washstand\nin the corner behind his screen where he made his moulds. Now he would\nsharpen a \"hoe\" excavator, now he would busy himself for a whole hour\nmaking \"mats\" and \"cylinders.\" Then he would look over his slate where\nhe kept a record of his appointments.\n\nOne day Trina softly opened the door of the \"Parlors\" and came in from\nthe sitting-room. She had not heard McTeague moving about for some time\nand had begun to wonder what he was doing. She came in, quietly shutting\nthe door behind her.\n\nMcTeague had tidied the room with the greatest care. The volumes of the\n\"Practical Dentist\" and the \"American System of Dentistry\" were piled\nupon the marble-top centre-table in rectangular blocks. The few chairs\nwere drawn up against the wall under the steel engraving of \"Lorenzo\nde' Medici\" with more than usual precision. The dental engine and the\nnickelled trimmings of the operating chair had been furbished till they\nshone, while on the movable rack in the bay window McTeague had arranged\nhis instruments with the greatest neatness and regularity. \"Hoe\"\nexcavators, pluggers, forceps, pliers, corundum disks and burrs, even\nthe boxwood mallet that Trina was never to use again, all were laid out\nand ready for immediate use.\n\nMcTeague himself sat in his operating chair, looking stupidly out of the\nwindows, across the roofs opposite, with an unseeing gaze, his red hands\nlying idly in his lap. Trina came up to him. There was something in his\neyes that made her put both arms around his neck and lay his huge head\nwith its coarse blond hair upon her shoulder.\n\n\"I--I got everything fixed,\" he said. \"I got everything fixed an' ready.\nSee, everything ready an' waiting, an'--an'--an' nobody comes, an'\nnobody's ever going to come any more. Oh, Trina!\" He put his arms about\nher and drew her down closer to him.\n\n\"Never mind, dear; never mind,\" cried Trina, through her tears. \"It'll\nall come right in the end, and we'll be poor together if we have to. You\ncan sure find something else to do. We'll start in again.\"\n\n\"Look at the slate there,\" said McTeague, pulling away from her and\nreaching down the slate on which he kept a record of his appointments.\n\"Look at them. There's Vanovitch at two on Wednesday, and Loughhead's\nwife Thursday morning, and Heise's little girl Thursday afternoon at\none-thirty; Mrs. Watson on Friday, and Vanovitch again Saturday morning\nearly--at seven. That's what I was to have had, and they ain't going to\ncome. They ain't ever going to come any more.\"\n\nTrina took the little slate from him and looked at it ruefully.\n\n\"Rub them out,\" she said, her voice trembling; \"rub it all out;\" and as\nshe spoke her eyes brimmed again, and a great tear dropped on the slate.\n\"That's it,\" she said; \"that's the way to rub it out, by me crying\non it.\" Then she passed her fingers over the tear-blurred writing and\nwashed the slate clean. \"All gone, all gone,\" she said.\n\n\"All gone,\" echoed the dentist. There was a silence. Then McTeague\nheaved himself up to his full six feet two, his face purpling, his\nenormous mallet-like fists raised over his head. His massive jaw\nprotruded more than ever, while his teeth clicked and grated together;\nthen he growled:\n\n\"If ever I meet Marcus Schouler--\" he broke off abruptly, the white of\nhis eyes growing suddenly pink.\n\n\"Oh, if ever you DO,\" exclaimed Trina, catching her breath.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 14\n\n\n\"Well, what do you think?\" said Trina.\n\nShe and McTeague stood in a tiny room at the back of the flat and on\nits very top floor. The room was whitewashed. It contained a bed,\nthree cane-seated chairs, and a wooden washstand with its washbowl and\npitcher. From its single uncurtained window one looked down into the\nflat's dirty back yard and upon the roofs of the hovels that bordered\nthe alley in the rear. There was a rag carpet on the floor. In place\nof a closet some dozen wooden pegs were affixed to the wall over the\nwashstand. There was a smell of cheap soap and of ancient hair-oil in\nthe air.\n\n\"That's a single bed,\" said Trina, \"but the landlady says she'll put in\na double one for us. You see----\"\n\n\"I ain't going to live here,\" growled McTeague.\n\n\"Well, you've got to live somewhere,\" said Trina, impatiently. \"We've\nlooked Polk Street over, and this is the only thing we can afford.\"\n\n\"Afford, afford,\" muttered the dentist. \"You with your five thousand\ndollars, and the two or three hundred you got saved up, talking about\n'afford.' You make me sick.\"\n\n\"Now, Mac,\" exclaimed Trina, deliberately, sitting down in one of the\ncane-seated chairs; \"now, Mac, let's have this thing----\"\n\n\"Well, I don't figure on living in one room,\" growled the dentist,\nsullenly. \"Let's live decently until we can get a fresh start. We've got\nthe money.\"\n\n\"Who's got the money?\"\n\n\"WE'VE got it.\"\n\n\"We!\"\n\n\"Well, it's all in the family. What's yours is mine, and what's mine is\nyours, ain't it?\"\n\n\"No, it's not; no, it's not,\" cried Trina, vehemently. \"It's all mine,\nmine. There's not a penny of it belongs to anybody else. I don't like to\nhave to talk this way to you, but you just make me. We're not going to\ntouch a penny of my five thousand nor a penny of that little money I\nmanaged to save--that seventy-five.\"\n\n\"That TWO hundred, you mean.\"\n\n\"That SEVENTY-FIVE. We're just going to live on the interest of that\nand on what I earn from Uncle Oelbermann--on just that thirty-one or two\ndollars.\"\n\n\"Huh! Think I'm going to do that, an' live in such a room as this?\"\n\nTrina folded her arms and looked him squarely in the face.\n\n\"Well, what ARE you going to do, then?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"I say, what ARE you going to do? You can go on and find something to do\nand earn some more money, and THEN we'll talk.\"\n\n\"Well, I ain't going to live here.\"\n\n\"Oh, very well, suit yourself. I'M going to live here.\"\n\n\"You'll live where I TELL you,\" the dentist suddenly cried, exasperated\nat the mincing tone she affected.\n\n\"Then YOU'LL pay the rent,\" exclaimed Trina, quite as angry as he.\n\n\"Are you my boss, I'd like to know? Who's the boss, you or I?\"\n\n\"Who's got the MONEY, I'd like to know?\" cried Trina, flushing to her\npale lips. \"Answer me that, McTeague, who's got the money?\"\n\n\"You make me sick, you and your money. Why, you're a miser. I never saw\nanything like it. When I was practising, I never thought of my fees as\nmy own; we lumped everything in together.\"\n\n\"Exactly; and I'M doing the working now. I'm working for Uncle\nOelbermann, and you're not lumping in ANYTHING now. I'm doing it all. Do\nyou know what I'm doing, McTeague? I'm supporting you.\"\n\n\"Ah, shut up; you make me sick.\"\n\n\"You got no RIGHT to talk to me that way. I won't let you. I--I won't\nhave it.\" She caught her breath. Tears were in her eyes.\n\n\"Oh, live where you like, then,\" said McTeague, sullenly.\n\n\"Well, shall we take this room then?\"\n\n\"All right, we'll take it. But why can't you take a little of your money\nan'--an'--sort of fix it up?\"\n\n\"Not a penny, not a single penny.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't care WHAT you do.\" And for the rest of the day the dentist\nand his wife did not speak.\n\nThis was not the only quarrel they had during these days when they were\noccupied in moving from their suite and in looking for new quarters.\nEvery hour the question of money came up. Trina had become more\nniggardly than ever since the loss of McTeague's practice. It was not\nmere economy with her now. It was a panic terror lest a fraction of a\ncent of her little savings should be touched; a passionate eagerness\nto continue to save in spite of all that had happened. Trina could have\neasily afforded better quarters than the single whitewashed room at the\ntop of the flat, but she made McTeague believe that it was impossible.\n\n\"I can still save a little,\" she said to herself, after the room had\nbeen engaged; \"perhaps almost as much as ever. I'll have three hundred\ndollars pretty soon, and Mac thinks it's only two hundred. It's almost\ntwo hundred and fifty; and I'll get a good deal out of the sale.\"\n\nBut this sale was a long agony. It lasted a week. Everything\nwent--everything but the few big pieces that went with the suite, and\nthat belonged to the photographer. The melodeon, the chairs, the black\nwalnut table before which they were married, the extension table in\nthe sitting-room, the kitchen table with its oilcloth cover, the framed\nlithographs from the English illustrated papers, the very carpets on\nthe floors. But Trina's heart nearly broke when the kitchen utensils and\nfurnishings began to go. Every pot, every stewpan, every knife and fork,\nwas an old friend. How she had worked over them! How clean she had kept\nthem! What a pleasure it had been to invade that little brick-paved\nkitchen every morning, and to wash up and put to rights after breakfast,\nturning on the hot water at the sink, raking down the ashes in the\ncook-stove, going and coming over the warm bricks, her head in the air,\nsinging at her work, proud in the sense of her proprietorship and her\nindependence! How happy had she been the day after her marriage when she\nhad first entered that kitchen and knew that it was all her own! And\nhow well she remembered her raids upon the bargain counters in the\nhouse-furnishing departments of the great down-town stores! And now it\nwas all to go. Some one else would have it all, while she was relegated\nto cheap restaurants and meals cooked by hired servants. Night after\nnight she sobbed herself to sleep at the thought of her past happiness\nand her present wretchedness. However, she was not alone in her\nunhappiness.\n\n\"Anyhow, I'm going to keep the steel engraving an' the stone pug dog,\"\ndeclared the dentist, his fist clenching. When it had come to the\nsale of his office effects McTeague had rebelled with the instinctive\nobstinacy of a boy, shutting his eyes and ears. Only little by little\ndid Trina induce him to part with his office furniture. He fought\nover every article, over the little iron stove, the bed-lounge, the\nmarble-topped centre table, the whatnot in the corner, the bound volumes\nof \"Allen's Practical Dentist,\" the rifle manufacturer's calendar, and\nthe prim, military chairs. A veritable scene took place between him and\nhis wife before he could bring himself to part with the steel engraving\nof \"Lorenzo de' Medici and His Court\" and the stone pug dog with its\ngoggle eyes.\n\n\"Why,\" he would cry, \"I've had 'em ever since--ever since I BEGAN; long\nbefore I knew you, Trina. That steel engraving I bought in Sacramento\none day when it was raining. I saw it in the window of a second-hand\nstore, and a fellow GAVE me that stone pug dog. He was a druggist. It\nwas in Sacramento too. We traded. I gave him a shaving-mug and a razor,\nand he gave me the pug dog.\"\n\nThere were, however, two of his belongings that even Trina could not\ninduce him to part with.\n\n\"And your concertina, Mac,\" she prompted, as they were making out the\nlist for the second-hand dealer. \"The concertina, and--oh, yes, the\ncanary and the bird cage.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Mac, you MUST be reasonable. The concertina would bring quite a\nsum, and the bird cage is as good as new. I'll sell the canary to the\nbird-store man on Kearney Street.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"If you're going to make objections to every single thing, we might as\nwell quit. Come, now, Mac, the concertina and the bird cage. We'll put\nthem in Lot D.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You'll have to come to it sooner or later. I'M giving up everything.\nI'm going to put them down, see.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nAnd she could get no further than that. The dentist did not lose his\ntemper, as in the case of the steel engraving or the stone pug dog;\nhe simply opposed her entreaties and persuasions with a passive, inert\nobstinacy that nothing could move. In the end Trina was obliged to\nsubmit. McTeague kept his concertina and his canary, even going so far\nas to put them both away in the bedroom, attaching to them tags on which\nhe had scrawled in immense round letters, \"Not for Sale.\"\n\nOne evening during that same week the dentist and his wife were in the\ndismantled sitting-room. The room presented the appearance of a wreck.\nThe Nottingham lace curtains were down. The extension table was heaped\nhigh with dishes, with tea and coffee pots, and with baskets of spoons\nand knives and forks. The melodeon was hauled out into the middle of the\nfloor, and covered with a sheet marked \"Lot A,\" the pictures were in a\npile in a corner, the chenille portieres were folded on top of the black\nwalnut table. The room was desolate, lamentable. Trina was going over\nthe inventory; McTeague, in his shirt sleeves, was smoking his pipe,\nlooking stupidly out of the window. All at once there was a brisk\nrapping at the door.\n\n\"Come in,\" called Trina, apprehensively. Now-a-days at every unexpected\nvisit she anticipated a fresh calamity. The door opened to let in a\nyoung man wearing a checked suit, a gay cravat, and a marvellously\nfigured waistcoat. Trina and McTeague recognized him at once. It was the\nOther Dentist, the debonair fellow whose clients were the barbers and\nthe young women of the candy stores and soda-water fountains, the poser,\nthe wearer of waistcoats, who bet money on greyhound races.\n\n\"How'do?\" said this one, bowing gracefully to the McTeagues as they\nstared at him distrustfully.\n\n\"How'do? They tell me, Doctor, that you are going out of the\nprofession.\"\n\nMcTeague muttered indistinctly behind his mustache and glowered at him.\n\n\"Well, say,\" continued the other, cheerily, \"I'd like to talk business\nwith you. That sign of yours, that big golden tooth that you got outside\nof your window, I don't suppose you'll have any further use for it.\nMaybe I'd buy it if we could agree on terms.\"\n\nTrina shot a glance at her husband. McTeague began to glower again.\n\n\"What do you say?\" said the Other Dentist.\n\n\"I guess not,\" growled McTeague\n\n\"What do you say to ten dollars?\"\n\n\"Ten dollars!\" cried Trina, her chin in the air.\n\n\"Well, what figure DO you put on it?\"\n\nTrina was about to answer when she was interrupted by McTeague.\n\n\"You go out of here.\"\n\n\"Hey? What?\"\n\n\"You go out of here.\"\n\nThe other retreated toward the door.\n\n\"You can't make small of me. Go out of here.\"\n\nMcTeague came forward a step, his great red fist clenching. The young\nman fled. But half way down the stairs he paused long enough to call\nback:\n\n\"You don't want to trade anything for a diploma, do you?\"\n\nMcTeague and his wife exchanged looks.\n\n\"How did he know?\" exclaimed Trina, sharply. They had invented and\nspread the fiction that McTeague was merely retiring from business,\nwithout assigning any reason. But evidently every one knew the real\ncause. The humiliation was complete now. Old Miss Baker confirmed their\nsuspicions on this point the next day. The little retired dressmaker\ncame down and wept with Trina over her misfortune, and did what\nshe could to encourage her. But she too knew that McTeague had been\nforbidden by the authorities from practising. Marcus had evidently left\nthem no loophole of escape.\n\n\"It's just like cutting off your husband's hands, my dear,\" said Miss\nBaker. \"And you two were so happy. When I first saw you together I said,\n'What a pair!'\"\n\nOld Grannis also called during this period of the breaking up of the\nMcTeague household.\n\n\"Dreadful, dreadful,\" murmured the old Englishman, his hand going\ntremulously to his chin. \"It seems unjust; it does. But Mr. Schouler\ncould not have set them on to do it. I can't quite believe it of him.\"\n\n\"Of Marcus!\" cried Trina. \"Hoh! Why, he threw his knife at Mac one time,\nand another time he bit him, actually bit him with his teeth, while they\nwere wrestling just for fun. Marcus would do anything to injure Mac.\"\n\n\"Dear, dear,\" returned Old Grannis, genuinely pained. \"I had always\nbelieved Schouler to be such a good fellow.\"\n\n\"That's because you're so good yourself, Mr. Grannis,\" responded Trina.\n\n\"I tell you what, Doc,\" declared Heise the harness-maker, shaking his\nfinger impressively at the dentist, \"you must fight it; you must appeal\nto the courts; you've been practising too long to be debarred now. The\nstatute of limitations, you know.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" Trina had exclaimed, when the dentist had repeated this advice\nto her. \"No, no, don't go near the law courts. I know them. The lawyers\ntake all your money, and you lose your case. We're bad off as it is,\nwithout lawing about it.\"\n\nThen at last came the sale. McTeague and Trina, whom Miss Baker had\ninvited to her room for that day, sat there side by side, holding each\nother's hands, listening nervously to the turmoil that rose to them from\nthe direction of their suite. From nine o'clock till dark the crowds\ncame and went. All Polk Street seemed to have invaded the suite, lured\non by the red flag that waved from the front windows. It was a fete, a\nveritable holiday, for the whole neighborhood. People with no thought\nof buying presented themselves. Young women--the candy-store girls and\nflorist's apprentices--came to see the fun, walking arm in arm from room\nto room, making jokes about the pretty lithographs and mimicking the\npicture of the two little girls saying their prayers.\n\n\"Look here,\" they would cry, \"look here what she used for\ncurtains--NOTTINGHAM lace, actually! Whoever thinks of buying Nottingham\nlace now-a-days? Say, don't that JAR you?\"\n\n\"And a melodeon,\" another one would exclaim, lifting the sheet. \"A\nmelodeon, when you can rent a piano for a dollar a week; and say, I\nreally believe they used to eat in the kitchen.\"\n\n\"Dollarn-half, dollarn-half, dollarn-half, give me two,\" intoned the\nauctioneer from the second-hand store. By noon the crowd became a jam.\nWagons backed up to the curb outside and departed heavily laden. In\nall directions people could be seen going away from the house, carrying\nsmall articles of furniture--a clock, a water pitcher, a towel rack.\nEvery now and then old Miss Baker, who had gone below to see how things\nwere progressing, returned with reports of the foray.\n\n\"Mrs. Heise bought the chenille portieres. Mister Ryer made a bid for\nyour bed, but a man in a gray coat bid over him. It was knocked down for\nthree dollars and a half. The German shoe-maker on the next block\nbought the stone pug dog. I saw our postman going away with a lot of the\npictures. Zerkow has come, on my word! the rags-bottles-sacks man; he's\nbuying lots; he bought all Doctor McTeague's gold tape and some of the\ninstruments. Maria's there too. That dentist on the corner took the\ndental engine, and wanted to get the sign, the big gold tooth,\" and so\non and so on. Cruelest of all, however, at least to Trina, was when Miss\nBaker herself began to buy, unable to resist a bargain. The last time\nshe came up she carried a bundle of the gay tidies that used to hang\nover the chair backs.\n\n\"He offered them, three for a nickel,\" she explained to Trina, \"and\nI thought I'd spend just a quarter. You don't mind, now, do you, Mrs.\nMcTeague?\"\n\n\"Why, no, of course not, Miss Baker,\" answered Trina, bravely.\n\n\"They'll look very pretty on some of my chairs,\" went on the little old\ndressmaker, innocently. \"See.\" She spread one of them on a chair back\nfor inspection. Trina's chin quivered.\n\n\"Oh, VERY pretty,\" she answered.\n\nAt length that dreadful day was over. The crowd dispersed. Even the\nauctioneer went at last, and as he closed the door with a bang,\nthe reverberation that went through the suite gave evidence of its\nemptiness.\n\n\"Come,\" said Trina to the dentist, \"let's go down and look--take a last\nlook.\"\n\nThey went out of Miss Baker's room and descended to the floor below.\nOn the stairs, however, they were met by Old Grannis. In his hands\nhe carried a little package. Was it possible that he too had taken\nadvantage of their misfortunes to join in the raid upon the suite?\n\n\"I went in,\" he began, timidly, \"for--for a few moments. This\"--he\nindicated the little package he carried--\"this was put up. It was of no\nvalue but to you. I--I ventured to bid it in. I thought perhaps\"--his\nhand went to his chin, \"that you wouldn't mind; that--in fact, I bought\nit for you--as a present. Will you take it?\" He handed the package to\nTrina and hurried on. Trina tore off the wrappings.\n\nIt was the framed photograph of McTeague and his wife in their wedding\nfinery, the one that had been taken immediately after the marriage.\nIt represented Trina sitting very erect in a rep armchair, holding her\nwedding bouquet straight before her, McTeague standing at her side, his\nleft foot forward, one hand upon her shoulder, and the other thrust into\nthe breast of his \"Prince Albert\" coat, in the attitude of a statue of a\nSecretary of State.\n\n\"Oh, it WAS good of him, it WAS good of him,\" cried Trina, her eyes\nfilling again. \"I had forgotten to put it away. Of course it was not for\nsale.\"\n\nThey went on down the stairs, and arriving at the door of the\nsitting-room, opened it and looked in. It was late in the afternoon,\nand there was just light enough for the dentist and his wife to see the\nresults of that day of sale. Nothing was left, not even the carpet.\nIt was a pillage, a devastation, the barrenness of a field after the\npassage of a swarm of locusts. The room had been picked and stripped\ntill only the bare walls and floor remained. Here where they had been\nmarried, where the wedding supper had taken place, where Trina had bade\nfarewell to her father and mother, here where she had spent those first\nfew hard months of her married life, where afterward she had grown to\nbe happy and contented, where she had passed the long hours of the\nafternoon at her work of whittling, and where she and her husband had\nspent so many evenings looking out of the window before the lamp was\nlit--here in what had been her home, nothing was left but echoes and the\nemptiness of complete desolation. Only one thing remained. On the wall\nbetween the windows, in its oval glass frame, preserved by some unknown\nand fearful process, a melancholy relic of a vanished happiness, unsold,\nneglected, and forgotten, a thing that nobody wanted, hung Trina's\nwedding bouquet.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 15\n\n\nThen the grind began. It would have been easier for the McTeagues to\nhave faced their misfortunes had they befallen them immediately after\ntheir marriage, when their love for each other was fresh and fine, and\nwhen they could have found a certain happiness in helping each other and\nsharing each other's privations. Trina, no doubt, loved her husband\nmore than ever, in the sense that she felt she belonged to him. But\nMcTeague's affection for his wife was dwindling a little every day--HAD\nbeen dwindling for a long time, in fact. He had become used to her by\nnow. She was part of the order of the things with which he found himself\nsurrounded. He saw nothing extraordinary about her; it was no longer a\npleasure for him to kiss her and take her in his arms; she was merely\nhis wife. He did not dislike her; he did not love her. She was his wife,\nthat was all. But he sadly missed and regretted all those little animal\ncomforts which in the old prosperous life Trina had managed to find for\nhim. He missed the cabbage soups and steaming chocolate that Trina had\ntaught him to like; he missed his good tobacco that Trina had educated\nhim to prefer; he missed the Sunday afternoon walks that she had caused\nhim to substitute in place of his nap in the operating chair; and he\nmissed the bottled beer that she had induced him to drink in place of\nthe steam beer from Frenna's. In the end he grew morose and sulky, and\nsometimes neglected to answer his wife when she spoke to him. Besides\nthis, Trina's avarice was a perpetual annoyance to him. Oftentimes when\na considerable alleviation of this unhappiness could have been obtained\nat the expense of a nickel or a dime, Trina refused the money with a\npettishness that was exasperating.\n\n\"No, no,\" she would exclaim. \"To ride to the park Sunday afternoon, that\nmeans ten cents, and I can't afford it.\"\n\n\"Let's walk there, then.\"\n\n\"I've got to work.\"\n\n\"But you've worked morning and afternoon every day this week.\"\n\n\"I don't care, I've got to work.\"\n\nThere had been a time when Trina had hated the idea of McTeague drinking\nsteam beer as common and vulgar.\n\n\"Say, let's have a bottle of beer to-night. We haven't had a drop of\nbeer in three weeks.\"\n\n\"We can't afford it. It's fifteen cents a bottle.\"\n\n\"But I haven't had a swallow of beer in three weeks.\"\n\n\"Drink STEAM beer, then. You've got a nickel. I gave you a quarter day\nbefore yesterday.\"\n\n\"But I don't like steam beer now.\"\n\nIt was so with everything. Unfortunately, Trina had cultivated tastes in\nMcTeague which now could not be gratified. He had come to be very proud\nof his silk hat and \"Prince Albert\" coat, and liked to wear them on\nSundays. Trina had made him sell both. He preferred \"Yale mixture\" in\nhis pipe; Trina had made him come down to \"Mastiff,\" a five-cent tobacco\nwith which he was once contented, but now abhorred. He liked to wear\nclean cuffs; Trina allowed him a fresh pair on Sundays only. At first\nthese deprivations angered McTeague. Then, all of a sudden, he slipped\nback into the old habits (that had been his before he knew Trina) with\nan ease that was surprising. Sundays he dined at the car conductors'\ncoffee-joint once more, and spent the afternoon lying full length upon\nthe bed, crop-full, stupid, warm, smoking his huge pipe, drinking his\nsteam beer, and playing his six mournful tunes upon his concertina,\ndozing off to sleep towards four o'clock.\n\nThe sale of their furniture had, after paying the rent and outstanding\nbills, netted about a hundred and thirty dollars. Trina believed that\nthe auctioneer from the second-hand store had swindled and cheated\nthem and had made a great outcry to no effect. But she had arranged the\naffair with the auctioneer herself, and offset her disappointment in the\nmatter of the sale by deceiving her husband as to the real amount of\nthe returns. It was easy to lie to McTeague, who took everything for\ngranted; and since the occasion of her trickery with the money that was\nto have been sent to her mother, Trina had found falsehood easier than\never.\n\n\"Seventy dollars is all the auctioneer gave me,\" she told her husband;\n\"and after paying the balance due on the rent, and the grocer's bill,\nthere's only fifty left.\"\n\n\"Only fifty?\" murmured McTeague, wagging his head, \"only fifty? Think of\nthat.\"\n\n\"Only fifty,\" declared Trina. Afterwards she said to herself with a\ncertain admiration for her cleverness:\n\n\"Couldn't save sixty dollars much easier than that,\" and she had added\nthe hundred and thirty to the little hoard in the chamois-skin bag and\nbrass match-box in the bottom of her trunk.\n\nIn these first months of their misfortunes the routine of the McTeagues\nwas as follows: They rose at seven and breakfasted in their room,\nTrina cooking the very meagre meal on an oil stove. Immediately after\nbreakfast Trina sat down to her work of whittling the Noah's ark\nanimals, and McTeague took himself off to walk down town. He had by the\ngreatest good luck secured a position with a manufacturer of surgical\ninstruments, where his manual dexterity in the making of excavators,\npluggers, and other dental contrivances stood him in fairly good stead.\nHe lunched at a sailor's boarding-house near the water front, and in the\nafternoon worked till six. He was home at six-thirty, and he and Trina\nhad supper together in the \"ladies' dining parlor,\" an adjunct of\nthe car conductors' coffee-joint. Trina, meanwhile, had worked at her\nwhittling all day long, with but half an hour's interval for lunch,\nwhich she herself prepared upon the oil stove. In the evening they were\nboth so tired that they were in no mood for conversation, and went to\nbed early, worn out, harried, nervous, and cross.\n\nTrina was not quite so scrupulously tidy now as in the old days. At one\ntime while whittling the Noah's ark animals she had worn gloves. She\nnever wore them now. She still took pride in neatly combing and coiling\nher wonderful black hair, but as the days passed she found it more and\nmore comfortable to work in her blue flannel wrapper. Whittlings and\nchips accumulated under the window where she did her work, and she was\nat no great pains to clear the air of the room vitiated by the fumes of\nthe oil stove and heavy with the smell of cooking. It was not gay, that\nlife. The room itself was not gay. The huge double bed sprawled over\nnearly a fourth of the available space; the angles of Trina's trunk and\nthe washstand projected into the room from the walls, and barked shins\nand scraped elbows. Streaks and spots of the \"non-poisonous\" paint that\nTrina used were upon the walls and wood-work. However, in one corner of\nthe room, next the window, monstrous, distorted, brilliant, shining with\na light of its own, stood the dentist's sign, the enormous golden tooth,\nthe tooth of a Brobdingnag.\n\nOne afternoon in September, about four months after the McTeagues had\nleft their suite, Trina was at her work by the window. She had whittled\nsome half-dozen sets of animals, and was now busy painting them and\nmaking the arks. Little pots of \"non-poisonous\" paint stood at her elbow\non the table, together with a box of labels that read, \"Made in France.\"\nHer huge clasp-knife was stuck into the under side of the table. She was\nnow occupied solely with the brushes and the glue pot. She turned the\nlittle figures in her fingers with a wonderful lightness and deftness,\npainting the chickens Naples yellow, the elephants blue gray, the horses\nVandyke brown, adding a dot of Chinese white for the eyes and sticking\nin the ears and tail with a drop of glue. The animals once done, she put\ntogether and painted the arks, some dozen of them, all windows and no\ndoors, each one opening only by a lid which was half the roof. She had\nall the work she could handle these days, for, from this time till a\nweek before Christmas, Uncle Oelbermann could take as many \"Noah's ark\nsets\" as she could make.\n\nSuddenly Trina paused in her work, looking expectantly toward the door.\nMcTeague came in.\n\n\"Why, Mac,\" exclaimed Trina. \"It's only three o'clock. What are you home\nso early for? Have they discharged you?\"\n\n\"They've fired me,\" said McTeague, sitting down on the bed.\n\n\"Fired you! What for?\"\n\n\"I don' know. Said the times were getting hard an' they had to let me\ngo.\"\n\nTrina let her paint-stained hands fall into her lap.\n\n\"OH!\" she cried. \"If we don't have the HARDEST luck of any two people\nI ever heard of. What can you do now? Is there another place like that\nwhere they make surgical instruments?\"\n\n\"Huh? No, I don' know. There's three more.\"\n\n\"Well, you must try them right away. Go down there right now.\"\n\n\"Huh? Right now? No, I'm tired. I'll go down in the morning.\"\n\n\"Mac,\" cried Trina, in alarm, \"what are you thinking of? You talk as\nthough we were millionaires. You must go down this minute. You're losing\nmoney every second you sit there.\" She goaded the huge fellow to his\nfeet again, thrust his hat into his hands, and pushed him out of the\ndoor, he obeying the while, docile and obedient as a big cart horse. He\nwas on the stairs when she came running after him.\n\n\"Mac, they paid you off, didn't they, when they discharged you?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then you must have some money. Give it to me.\"\n\nThe dentist heaved a shoulder uneasily.\n\n\"No, I don' want to.\"\n\n\"I've got to have that money. There's no more oil for the stove, and I\nmust buy some more meal tickets to-night.\"\n\n\"Always after me about money,\" muttered the dentist; but he emptied his\npockets for her, nevertheless.\n\n\"I--you've taken it all,\" he grumbled. \"Better leave me something for\ncar fare. It's going to rain.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! You can walk just as well as not. A big fellow like you 'fraid\nof a little walk; and it ain't going to rain.\"\n\nTrina had lied again both as to the want of oil for the stove and the\ncommutation ticket for the restaurant. But she knew by instinct that\nMcTeague had money about him, and she did not intend to let it go out of\nthe house. She listened intently until she was sure McTeague was gone.\nThen she hurriedly opened her trunk and hid the money in the chamois bag\nat the bottom.\n\nThe dentist presented himself at every one of the makers of surgical\ninstruments that afternoon and was promptly turned away in each case.\nThen it came on to rain, a fine, cold drizzle, that chilled him and wet\nhim to the bone. He had no umbrella, and Trina had not left him even\nfive cents for car fare. He started to walk home through the rain. It\nwas a long way to Polk Street, as the last manufactory he had visited\nwas beyond even Folsom Street, and not far from the city front.\n\nBy the time McTeague reached Polk Street his teeth were chattering\nwith the cold. He was wet from head to foot. As he was passing Heise's\nharness shop a sudden deluge of rain overtook him and he was obliged to\ndodge into the vestibule for shelter. He, who loved to be warm, to\nsleep and to be well fed, was icy cold, was exhausted and footsore\nfrom tramping the city. He could look forward to nothing better than a\nbadly-cooked supper at the coffee-joint--hot meat on a cold plate,\nhalf done suet pudding, muddy coffee, and bad bread, and he was cold,\nmiserably cold, and wet to the bone. All at once a sudden rage against\nTrina took possession of him. It was her fault. She knew it was going\nto rain, and she had not let him have a nickel for car fare--she who had\nfive thousand dollars. She let him walk the streets in the cold and in\nthe rain. \"Miser,\" he growled behind his mustache. \"Miser, nasty little\nold miser. You're worse than old Zerkow, always nagging about money,\nmoney, and you got five thousand dollars. You got more, an' you live\nin that stinking hole of a room, and you won't drink any decent beer. I\nain't going to stand it much longer. She knew it was going to rain. She\nKNEW it. Didn't I TELL her? And she drives me out of my own home in the\nrain, for me to get money for her; more money, and she takes it. She\ntook that money from me that I earned. 'Twasn't hers; it was mine, I\nearned it--and not a nickel for car fare. She don't care if I get wet\nand get a cold and DIE. No, she don't, as long as she's warm and's got\nher money.\" He became more and more indignant at the picture he made of\nhimself. \"I ain't going to stand it much longer,\" he repeated.\n\n\"Why, hello, Doc. Is that you?\" exclaimed Heise, opening the door of\nthe harness shop behind him. \"Come in out of the wet. Why, you're soaked\nthrough,\" he added as he and McTeague came back into the shop, that\nreeked of oiled leather. \"Didn't you have any umbrella? Ought to have\ntaken a car.\"\n\n\"I guess so--I guess so,\" murmured the dentist, confused. His teeth were\nchattering.\n\n\"YOU'RE going to catch your death-a-cold,\" exclaimed Heise. \"Tell you\nwhat,\" he said, reaching for his hat, \"come in next door to Frenna's and\nhave something to warm you up. I'll get the old lady to mind the shop.\"\nHe called Mrs. Heise down from the floor above and took McTeague into\nJoe Frenna's saloon, which was two doors above his harness shop.\n\n\"Whiskey and gum twice, Joe,\" said he to the barkeeper as he and the\ndentist approached the bar.\n\n\"Huh? What?\" said McTeague. \"Whiskey? No, I can't drink whiskey. It kind\nof disagrees with me.\"\n\n\"Oh, the hell!\" returned Heise, easily. \"Take it as medicine. You'll get\nyour death-a-cold if you stand round soaked like that. Two whiskey and\ngum, Joe.\"\n\nMcTeague emptied the pony glass at a single enormous gulp.\n\n\"That's the way,\" said Heise, approvingly. \"Do you good.\" He drank his\noff slowly.\n\n\"I'd--I'd ask you to have a drink with me, Heise,\" said the dentist, who\nhad an indistinct idea of the amenities of the barroom, \"only,\" he added\nshamefacedly, \"only--you see, I don't believe I got any change.\" His\nanger against Trina, heated by the whiskey he had drank, flamed up\nafresh. What a humiliating position for Trina to place him in, not to\nleave him the price of a drink with a friend, she who had five thousand\ndollars!\n\n\"Sha! That's all right, Doc,\" returned Heise, nibbling on a grain of\ncoffee. \"Want another? Hey? This my treat. Two more of the same, Joe.\"\n\nMcTeague hesitated. It was lamentably true that whiskey did not agree\nwith him; he knew it well enough. However, by this time he felt very\ncomfortably warm at the pit of his stomach. The blood was beginning to\ncirculate in his chilled finger-tips and in his soggy, wet feet. He had\nhad a hard day of it; in fact, the last week, the last month, the last\nthree or four months, had been hard. He deserved a little consolation.\nNor could Trina object to this. It wasn't costing a cent. He drank again\nwith Heise.\n\n\"Get up here to the stove and warm yourself,\" urged Heise, drawing up\na couple of chairs and cocking his feet upon the guard. The two fell to\ntalking while McTeague's draggled coat and trousers smoked.\n\n\"What a dirty turn that was that Marcus Schouler did you!\" said Heise,\nwagging his head. \"You ought to have fought that, Doc, sure. You'd been\npractising too long.\" They discussed this question some ten or fifteen\nminutes and then Heise rose.\n\n\"Well, this ain't earning any money. I got to get back to the shop.\"\nMcTeague got up as well, and the pair started for the door. Just as they\nwere going out Ryer met them.\n\n\"Hello, hello,\" he cried. \"Lord, what a wet day! You two are going the\nwrong way. You're going to have a drink with me. Three whiskey punches,\nJoe.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" answered McTeague, shaking his head. \"I'm going back home.\nI've had two glasses of whiskey already.\"\n\n\"Sha!\" cried Heise, catching his arm. \"A strapping big chap like you\nain't afraid of a little whiskey.\"\n\n\"Well, I--I--I got to go right afterwards,\" protested McTeague.\n\nAbout half an hour after the dentist had left to go down town, Maria\nMacapa had come in to see Trina. Occasionally Maria dropped in on Trina\nin this fashion and spent an hour or so chatting with her while she\nworked. At first Trina had been inclined to resent these intrusions of\nthe Mexican woman, but of late she had begun to tolerate them. Her day\nwas long and cheerless at the best, and there was no one to talk to.\nTrina even fancied that old Miss Baker had come to be less cordial since\ntheir misfortune. Maria retailed to her all the gossip of the flat and\nthe neighborhood, and, which was much more interesting, told her of her\ntroubles with Zerkow.\n\nTrina said to herself that Maria was common and vulgar, but one had\nto have some diversion, and Trina could talk and listen without\ninterrupting her work. On this particular occasion Maria was much\nexcited over Zerkow's demeanor of late.\n\n\"He's gettun worse an' worse,\" she informed Trina as she sat on the edge\nof the bed, her chin in her hand. \"He says he knows I got the dishes and\nam hidun them from him. The other day I thought he'd gone off with his\nwagon, and I was doin' a bit of ir'ning, an' by an' by all of a sudden I\nsaw him peeping at me through the crack of the door. I never let on\nthat I saw him, and, honest, he stayed there over two hours, watchun\neverything I did. I could just feel his eyes on the back of my neck all\nthe time. Last Sunday he took down part of the wall, 'cause he said\nhe'd seen me making figures on it. Well, I was, but it was just the wash\nlist. All the time he says he'll kill me if I don't tell.\"\n\n\"Why, what do you stay with him for?\" exclaimed Trina. \"I'd be deathly\n'fraid of a man like that; and he did take a knife to you once.\"\n\n\"Hoh! HE won't kill me, never fear. If he'd kill me he'd never know\nwhere the dishes were; that's what HE thinks.\"\n\n\"But I can't understand, Maria; you told him about those gold dishes\nyourself.\"\n\n\"Never, never! I never saw such a lot of crazy folks as you are.\"\n\n\"But you say he hits you sometimes.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" said Maria, tossing her head scornfully, \"I ain't afraid of him.\nHe takes his horsewhip to me now and then, but I can always manage.\nI say, 'If you touch me with that, then I'll NEVER tell you.' Just\npretending, you know, and he drops it as though it was red hot. Say,\nMrs. McTeague, have you got any tea? Let's make a cup of tea over the\nstove.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" cried Trina, with niggardly apprehension; \"no, I haven't got a\nbit of tea.\" Trina's stinginess had increased to such an extent that it\nhad gone beyond the mere hoarding of money. She grudged even the food\nthat she and McTeague ate, and even brought away half loaves of bread,\nlumps of sugar, and fruit from the car conductors' coffee-joint. She hid\nthese pilferings away on the shelf by the window, and often managed\nto make a very creditable lunch from them, enjoying the meal with the\ngreater relish because it cost her nothing.\n\n\"No, Maria, I haven't got a bit of tea,\" she said, shaking her head\ndecisively. \"Hark, ain't that Mac?\" she added, her chin in the air.\n\"That's his step, sure.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm going to skip,\" said Maria. She left hurriedly, passing\nthe dentist in the hall just outside the door. \"Well?\" said Trina\ninterrogatively as her husband entered. McTeague did not answer. He hung\nhis hat on the hook behind the door and dropped heavily into a chair.\n\n\"Well,\" asked Trina, anxiously, \"how did you make out, Mac?\"\n\nStill the dentist pretended not to hear, scowling fiercely at his muddy\nboots.\n\n\"Tell me, Mac, I want to know. Did you get a place? Did you get caught\nin the rain?\"\n\n\"Did I? Did I?\" cried the dentist, sharply, an alacrity in his manner\nand voice that Trina had never observed before.\n\n\"Look at me. Look at me,\" he went on, speaking with an unwonted\nrapidity, his wits sharp, his ideas succeeding each other quickly. \"Look\nat me, drenched through, shivering cold. I've walked the city over.\nCaught in the rain! Yes, I guess I did get caught in the rain, and it\nain't your fault I didn't catch my death-a-cold; wouldn't even let me\nhave a nickel for car fare.\"\n\n\"But, Mac,\" protested Trina, \"I didn't know it was going to rain.\"\n\nThe dentist put back his head and laughed scornfully. His face was very\nred, and his small eyes twinkled. \"Hoh! no, you didn't know it was going\nto rain. Didn't I TELL you it was?\" he exclaimed, suddenly angry again.\n\"Oh, you're a DAISY, you are. Think I'm going to put up with your\nfoolishness ALL the time? Who's the boss, you or I?\"\n\n\"Why, Mac, I never saw you this way before. You talk like a different\nman.\"\n\n\"Well, I AM a different man,\" retorted the dentist, savagely. \"You can't\nmake small of me ALWAYS.\"\n\n\"Well, never mind that. You know I'm not trying to make small of you.\nBut never mind that. Did you get a place?\"\n\n\"Give me my money,\" exclaimed McTeague, jumping up briskly. There was\nan activity, a positive nimbleness about the huge blond giant that\nhad never been his before; also his stupidity, the sluggishness of his\nbrain, seemed to be unusually stimulated.\n\n\"Give me my money, the money I gave you as I was going away.\"\n\n\"I can't,\" exclaimed Trina. \"I paid the grocer's bill with it while you\nwere gone.\"\n\n\"Don't believe you.\"\n\n\"Truly, truly, Mac. Do you think I'd lie to you? Do you think I'd lower\nmyself to do that?\"\n\n\"Well, the next time I earn any money I'll keep it myself.\"\n\n\"But tell me, Mac, DID you get a place?\"\n\nMcTeague turned his back on her.\n\n\"Tell me, Mac, please, did you?\"\n\nThe dentist jumped up and thrust his face close to hers, his heavy jaw\nprotruding, his little eyes twinkling meanly.\n\n\"No,\" he shouted. \"No, no, NO. Do you hear? NO.\"\n\nTrina cowered before him. Then suddenly she began to sob aloud, weeping\npartly at his strange brutality, partly at the disappointment of his\nfailure to find employment.\n\nMcTeague cast a contemptuous glance about him, a glance that embraced\nthe dingy, cheerless room, the rain streaming down the panes of the one\nwindow, and the figure of his weeping wife.\n\n\"Oh, ain't this all FINE?\" he exclaimed. \"Ain't it lovely?\"\n\n\"It's not my fault,\" sobbed Trina.\n\n\"It is too,\" vociferated McTeague. \"It is too. We could live like\nChristians and decent people if you wanted to. You got more'n five\nthousand dollars, and you're so damned stingy that you'd rather live in\na rat hole--and make me live there too--before you'd part with a nickel\nof it. I tell you I'm sick and tired of the whole business.\"\n\nAn allusion to her lottery money never failed to rouse Trina.\n\n\"And I'll tell you this much too,\" she cried, winking back the tears.\n\"Now that you're out of a job, we can't afford even to live in your rat\nhole, as you call it. We've got to find a cheaper place than THIS even.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed the dentist, purple with rage. \"What, get into a worse\nhole in the wall than this? Well, we'll SEE if we will. We'll just see\nabout that. You're going to do just as I tell you after this, Trina\nMcTeague,\" and once more he thrust his face close to hers.\n\n\"I know what's the matter,\" cried Trina, with a half sob; \"I know, I can\nsmell it on your breath. You've been drinking whiskey.\"\n\n\"Yes, I've been drinking whiskey,\" retorted her husband. \"I've been\ndrinking whiskey. Have you got anything to say about it? Ah, yes, you're\nRIGHT, I've been drinking whiskey. What have YOU got to say about my\ndrinking whiskey? Let's hear it.\"\n\n\"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" sobbed Trina, covering her face with her hands. McTeague\ncaught her wrists in one palm and pulled them down. Trina's pale face\nwas streaming with tears; her long, narrow blue eyes were swimming; her\nadorable little chin upraised and quivering.\n\n\"Let's hear what you got to say,\" exclaimed McTeague.\n\n\"Nothing, nothing,\" said Trina, between her sobs.\n\n\"Then stop that noise. Stop it, do you hear me? Stop it.\" He threw up\nhis open hand threateningly. \"STOP!\" he exclaimed.\n\nTrina looked at him fearfully, half blinded with weeping. Her husband's\nthick mane of yellow hair was disordered and rumpled upon his great\nsquare-cut head; his big red ears were redder than ever; his face was\npurple; the thick eyebrows were knotted over the small, twinkling eyes;\nthe heavy yellow mustache, that smelt of alcohol, drooped over the\nmassive, protruding chin, salient, like that of the carnivora; the veins\nwere swollen and throbbing on his thick red neck; while over her head\nTrina saw his upraised palm, callused, enormous.\n\n\"Stop!\" he exclaimed. And Trina, watching fearfully, saw the palm\nsuddenly contract into a fist, a fist that was hard as a wooden mallet,\nthe fist of the old-time car-boy. And then her ancient terror of him,\nthe intuitive fear of the male, leaped to life again. She was afraid of\nhim. Every nerve of her quailed and shrank from him. She choked back her\nsobs, catching her breath.\n\n\"There,\" growled the dentist, releasing her, \"that's more like. Now,\"\nhe went on, fixing her with his little eyes, \"now listen to me. I'm beat\nout. I've walked the city over--ten miles, I guess--an' I'm going to\nbed, an' I don't want to be bothered. You understand? I want to be let\nalone.\" Trina was silent.\n\n\"Do you HEAR?\" he snarled.\n\n\"Yes, Mac.\"\n\nThe dentist took off his coat, his collar and necktie, unbuttoned his\nvest, and slipped his heavy-soled boots from his big feet. Then he\nstretched himself upon the bed and rolled over towards the wall. In a\nfew minutes the sound of his snoring filled the room.\n\nTrina craned her neck and looked at her husband over the footboard of\nthe bed. She saw his red, congested face; the huge mouth wide open; his\nunclean shirt, with its frayed wristbands; and his huge feet encased\nin thick woollen socks. Then her grief and the sense of her unhappiness\nreturned more poignant than ever. She stretched her arms out in front of\nher on her work-table, and, burying her face in them, cried and sobbed\nas though her heart would break.\n\nThe rain continued. The panes of the single window ran with sheets of\nwater; the eaves dripped incessantly. It grew darker. The tiny, grimy\nroom, full of the smells of cooking and of \"non-poisonous\" paint, took\non an aspect of desolation and cheerlessness lamentable beyond words.\nThe canary in its little gilt prison chittered feebly from time to time.\nSprawled at full length upon the bed, the dentist snored and snored,\nstupefied, inert, his legs wide apart, his hands lying palm upward at\nhis sides.\n\nAt last Trina raised her head, with a long, trembling breath. She rose,\nand going over to the washstand, poured some water from the pitcher into\nthe basin, and washed her face and swollen eyelids, and rearranged her\nhair. Suddenly, as she was about to return to her work, she was struck\nwith an idea.\n\n\"I wonder,\" she said to herself, \"I wonder where he got the money to buy\nhis whiskey.\" She searched the pockets of his coat, which he had flung\ninto a corner of the room, and even came up to him as he lay upon the\nbed and went through the pockets of his vest and trousers. She found\nnothing.\n\n\"I wonder,\" she murmured, \"I wonder if he's got any money he don't tell\nme about. I'll have to look out for that.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 16\n\n\nA week passed, then a fortnight, then a month. It was a month of the\ngreatest anxiety and unquietude for Trina. McTeague was out of a job,\ncould find nothing to do; and Trina, who saw the impossibility of saving\nas much money as usual out of her earnings under the present conditions,\nwas on the lookout for cheaper quarters. In spite of his outcries and\nsulky resistance Trina had induced her husband to consent to such a\nmove, bewildering him with a torrent of phrases and marvellous columns\nof figures by which she proved conclusively that they were in a\ncondition but one remove from downright destitution.\n\nThe dentist continued idle. Since his ill success with the manufacturers\nof surgical instruments he had made but two attempts to secure a job.\nTrina had gone to see Uncle Oelbermann and had obtained for McTeague a\nposition in the shipping department of the wholesale toy store. However,\nit was a position that involved a certain amount of ciphering, and\nMcTeague had been obliged to throw it up in two days.\n\nThen for a time they had entertained a wild idea that a place on the\npolice force could be secured for McTeague. He could pass the physical\nexamination with flying colors, and Ryer, who had become the secretary\nof the Polk Street Improvement Club, promised the requisite political\n\"pull.\" If McTeague had shown a certain energy in the matter the attempt\nmight have been successful; but he was too stupid, or of late had become\ntoo listless to exert himself greatly, and the affair resulted only in a\nviolent quarrel with Ryer.\n\nMcTeague had lost his ambition. He did not care to better his situation.\nAll he wanted was a warm place to sleep and three good meals a day.\nAt the first--at the very first--he had chafed at his idleness and had\nspent the days with his wife in their one narrow room, walking back and\nforth with the restlessness of a caged brute, or sitting motionless for\nhours, watching Trina at her work, feeling a dull glow of shame at the\nidea that she was supporting him. This feeling had worn off quickly,\nhowever. Trina's work was only hard when she chose to make it so, and as\na rule she supported their misfortunes with a silent fortitude.\n\nThen, wearied at his inaction and feeling the need of movement and\nexercise, McTeague would light his pipe and take a turn upon the great\navenue one block above Polk Street. A gang of laborers were digging the\nfoundations for a large brownstone house, and McTeague found interest\nand amusement in leaning over the barrier that surrounded the\nexcavations and watching the progress of the work. He came to see\nit every afternoon; by and by he even got to know the foreman who\nsuperintended the job, and the two had long talks together. Then\nMcTeague would return to Polk Street and find Heise in the back room of\nthe harness shop, and occasionally the day ended with some half dozen\ndrinks of whiskey at Joe Frenna's saloon.\n\nIt was curious to note the effect of the alcohol upon the dentist.\nIt did not make him drunk, it made him vicious. So far from being\nstupefied, he became, after the fourth glass, active, alert,\nquick-witted, even talkative; a certain wickedness stirred in him then;\nhe was intractable, mean; and when he had drunk a little more heavily\nthan usual, he found a certain pleasure in annoying and exasperating\nTrina, even in abusing and hurting her.\n\nIt had begun on the evening of Thanksgiving Day, when Heise had taken\nMcTeague out to dinner with him. The dentist on this occasion had\ndrunk very freely. He and Heise had returned to Polk Street towards ten\no'clock, and Heise at once suggested a couple of drinks at Frenna's.\n\n\"All right, all right,\" said McTeague. \"Drinks, that's the word. I'll go\nhome and get some money and meet you at Joe's.\"\n\nTrina was awakened by her husband pinching her arm.\n\n\"Oh, Mac,\" she cried, jumping up in bed with a little scream, \"how you\nhurt! Oh, that hurt me dreadfully.\"\n\n\"Give me a little money,\" answered the dentist, grinning, and pinching\nher again.\n\n\"I haven't a cent. There's not a--oh, MAC, will you stop? I won't have\nyou pinch me that way.\"\n\n\"Hurry up,\" answered her husband, calmly, nipping the flesh of her\nshoulder between his thumb and finger. \"Heise's waiting for me.\" Trina\nwrenched from him with a sharp intake of breath, frowning with pain, and\ncaressing her shoulder.\n\n\"Mac, you've no idea how that hurts. Mac, STOP!\"\n\n\"Give me some money, then.\"\n\nIn the end Trina had to comply. She gave him half a dollar from her\ndress pocket, protesting that it was the only piece of money she had.\n\n\"One more, just for luck,\" said McTeague, pinching her again; \"and\nanother.\"\n\n\"How can you--how CAN you hurt a woman so!\" exclaimed Trina, beginning\nto cry with the pain.\n\n\"Ah, now, CRY,\" retorted the dentist. \"That's right, CRY. I never saw\nsuch a little fool.\" He went out, slamming the door in disgust.\n\nBut McTeague never became a drunkard in the generally received sense of\nthe term. He did not drink to excess more than two or three times in a\nmonth, and never upon any occasion did he become maudlin or staggering.\nPerhaps his nerves were naturally too dull to admit of any excitation;\nperhaps he did not really care for the whiskey, and only drank because\nHeise and the other men at Frenna's did. Trina could often reproach\nhim with drinking too much; she never could say that he was drunk. The\nalcohol had its effect for all that. It roused the man, or rather the\nbrute in the man, and now not only roused it, but goaded it to evil.\nMcTeague's nature changed. It was not only the alcohol, it was idleness\nand a general throwing off of the good influence his wife had had over\nhim in the days of their prosperity. McTeague disliked Trina. She was a\nperpetual irritation to him. She annoyed him because she was so small,\nso prettily made, so invariably correct and precise. Her avarice\nincessantly harassed him. Her industry was a constant reproach to him.\nShe seemed to flaunt her work defiantly in his face. It was the red\nflag in the eyes of the bull. One time when he had just come back from\nFrenna's and had been sitting in the chair near her, silently watching\nher at her work, he exclaimed all of a sudden:\n\n\"Stop working. Stop it, I tell you. Put 'em away. Put 'em all away, or\nI'll pinch you.\"\n\n\"But why--why?\" Trina protested.\n\nThe dentist cuffed her ears. \"I won't have you work.\" He took her knife\nand her paint-pots away, and made her sit idly in the window the rest of\nthe afternoon.\n\nIt was, however, only when his wits had been stirred with alcohol that\nthe dentist was brutal to his wife. At other times, say three weeks of\nevery month, she was merely an incumbrance to him. They often quarrelled\nabout Trina's money, her savings. The dentist was bent upon having at\nleast a part of them. What he would do with the money once he had it,\nhe did not precisely know. He would spend it in royal fashion, no doubt,\nfeasting continually, buying himself wonderful clothes. The miner's idea\nof money quickly gained and lavishly squandered, persisted in his mind.\nAs for Trina, the more her husband stormed, the tighter she drew the\nstrings of the little chamois-skin bag that she hid at the bottom of her\ntrunk underneath her bridal dress. Her five thousand dollars invested in\nUncle Oelbermann's business was a glittering, splendid dream which came\nto her almost every hour of the day as a solace and a compensation for\nall her unhappiness.\n\nAt times, when she knew that McTeague was far from home, she would lock\nher door, open her trunk, and pile all her little hoard on her table. By\nnow it was four hundred and seven dollars and fifty cents. Trina\nwould play with this money by the hour, piling it, and repiling it, or\ngathering it all into one heap, and drawing back to the farthest corner\nof the room to note the effect, her head on one side. She polished the\ngold pieces with a mixture of soap and ashes until they shone, wiping\nthem carefully on her apron. Or, again, she would draw the heap lovingly\ntoward her and bury her face in it, delighted at the smell of it and the\nfeel of the smooth, cool metal on her cheeks. She even put the smaller\ngold pieces in her mouth, and jingled them there. She loved her money\nwith an intensity that she could hardly express. She would plunge her\nsmall fingers into the pile with little murmurs of affection, her long,\nnarrow eyes half closed and shining, her breath coming in long sighs.\n\n\"Ah, the dear money, the dear money,\" she would whisper. \"I love you so!\nAll mine, every penny of it. No one shall ever, ever get you. How I've\nworked for you! How I've slaved and saved for you! And I'm going to get\nmore; I'm going to get more, more, more; a little every day.\"\n\nShe was still looking for cheaper quarters. Whenever she could spare a\nmoment from her work, she would put on her hat and range up and down the\nentire neighborhood from Sutter to Sacramento Streets, going into\nall the alleys and bystreets, her head in the air, looking for the\n\"Rooms-to-let\" sign. But she was in despair. All the cheaper tenements\nwere occupied. She could find no room more reasonable than the one she\nand the dentist now occupied.\n\nAs time went on, McTeague's idleness became habitual. He drank no more\nwhiskey than at first, but his dislike for Trina increased with every\nday of their poverty, with every day of Trina's persistent stinginess.\nAt times--fortunately rare he was more than ever brutal to her. He would\nbox her ears or hit her a great blow with the back of a hair-brush,\nor even with his closed fist. His old-time affection for his \"little\nwoman,\" unable to stand the test of privation, had lapsed by degrees,\nand what little of it was left was changed, distorted, and made\nmonstrous by the alcohol.\n\nThe people about the house and the clerks at the provision stores often\nremarked that Trina's fingertips were swollen and the nails purple as\nthough they had been shut in a door. Indeed, this was the explanation\nshe gave. The fact of the matter was that McTeague, when he had been\ndrinking, used to bite them, crunching and grinding them with his\nimmense teeth, always ingenious enough to remember which were the\nsorest. Sometimes he extorted money from her by this means, but as often\nas not he did it for his own satisfaction.\n\nAnd in some strange, inexplicable way this brutality made Trina all\nthe more affectionate; aroused in her a morbid, unwholesome love of\nsubmission, a strange, unnatural pleasure in yielding, in surrendering\nherself to the will of an irresistible, virile power.\n\nTrina's emotions had narrowed with the narrowing of her daily life. They\nreduced themselves at last to but two, her passion for her money and\nher perverted love for her husband when he was brutal. She was a strange\nwoman during these days.\n\nTrina had come to be on very intimate terms with Maria Macapa, and\nin the end the dentist's wife and the maid of all work became great\nfriends. Maria was constantly in and out of Trina's room, and, whenever\nshe could, Trina threw a shawl over her head and returned Maria's calls.\nTrina could reach Zerkow's dirty house without going into the street.\nThe back yard of the flat had a gate that opened into a little inclosure\nwhere Zerkow kept his decrepit horse and ramshackle wagon, and from\nthence Trina could enter directly into Maria's kitchen. Trina made long\nvisits to Maria during the morning in her dressing-gown and curl papers,\nand the two talked at great length over a cup of tea served on the edge\nof the sink or a corner of the laundry table. The talk was all of their\nhusbands and of what to do when they came home in aggressive moods.\n\n\"You never ought to fight um,\" advised Maria. \"It only makes um worse.\nJust hump your back, and it's soonest over.\"\n\nThey told each other of their husbands' brutalities, taking a strange\nsort of pride in recounting some particularly savage blow, each trying\nto make out that her own husband was the most cruel. They critically\ncompared each other's bruises, each one glad when she could exhibit\nthe worst. They exaggerated, they invented details, and, as if proud of\ntheir beatings, as if glorying in their husbands' mishandling, lied to\neach other, magnifying their own maltreatment. They had long and excited\narguments as to which were the most effective means of punishment, the\nrope's ends and cart whips such as Zerkow used, or the fists and backs\nof hair-brushes affected by McTeague. Maria contended that the lash of\nthe whip hurt the most; Trina, that the butt did the most injury.\n\nMaria showed Trina the holes in the walls and the loosened boards in the\nflooring where Zerkow had been searching for the gold plate. Of late\nhe had been digging in the back yard and had ransacked the hay in his\nhorse-shed for the concealed leather chest he imagined he would find.\nBut he was becoming impatient, evidently.\n\n\"The way he goes on,\" Maria told Trina, \"is somethun dreadful. He's\ngettun regularly sick with it--got a fever every night--don't sleep, and\nwhen he does, talks to himself. Says 'More'n a hundred pieces, an' every\none of 'em gold. More'n a hundred pieces, an' every one of 'em gold.'\nThen he'll whale me with his whip, and shout, 'You know where it is.\nTell me, tell me, you swine, or I'll do for you.' An' then he'll get\ndown on his knees and whimper, and beg me to tell um where I've hid it.\nHe's just gone plum crazy. Sometimes he has regular fits, he gets so\nmad, and rolls on the floor and scratches himself.\"\n\nOne morning in November, about ten o'clock, Trina pasted a \"Made in\nFrance\" label on the bottom of a Noah's ark, and leaned back in\nher chair with a long sigh of relief. She had just finished a large\nChristmas order for Uncle Oelbermann, and there was nothing else she\ncould do that morning. The bed had not yet been made, nor had the\nbreakfast things been washed. Trina hesitated for a moment, then put her\nchin in the air indifferently.\n\n\"Bah!\" she said, \"let them go till this afternoon. I don't care WHEN\nthe room is put to rights, and I know Mac don't.\" She determined that\ninstead of making the bed or washing the dishes she would go and call\non Miss Baker on the floor below. The little dressmaker might ask her\nto stay to lunch, and that would be something saved, as the dentist had\nannounced his intention that morning of taking a long walk out to the\nPresidio to be gone all day.\n\nBut Trina rapped on Miss Baker's door in vain that morning. She was\nout. Perhaps she was gone to the florist's to buy some geranium seeds.\nHowever, Old Grannis's door stood a little ajar, and on hearing Trina at\nMiss Baker's room, the old Englishman came out into the hall.\n\n\"She's gone out,\" he said, uncertainly, and in a half whisper, \"went\nout about half an hour ago. I--I think she went to the drug store to get\nsome wafers for the goldfish.\"\n\n\"Don't you go to your dog hospital any more, Mister Grannis?\" said\nTrina, leaning against the balustrade in the hall, willing to talk a\nmoment.\n\nOld Grannis stood in the doorway of his room, in his carpet slippers and\nfaded corduroy jacket that he wore when at home.\n\n\"Why--why,\" he said, hesitating, tapping his chin thoughtfully. \"You see\nI'm thinking of giving up the little hospital.\"\n\n\"Giving it up?\"\n\n\"You see, the people at the book store where I buy my pamphlets have\nfound out--I told them of my contrivance for binding books, and one of\nthe members of the firm came up to look at it. He offered me quite a sum\nif I would sell him the right of it--the--patent of it--quite a sum. In\nfact--in fact--yes, quite a sum, quite.\" He rubbed his chin tremulously\nand looked about him on the floor.\n\n\"Why, isn't that fine?\" said Trina, good-naturedly. \"I'm very glad,\nMister Grannis. Is it a good price?\"\n\n\"Quite a sum--quite. In fact, I never dreamed of having so much money.\"\n\n\"Now, see here, Mister Grannis,\" said Trina, decisively, \"I want to give\nyou a good piece of advice. Here are you and Miss Baker----\" The old\nEnglishman started nervously--\"You and Miss Baker, that have been in\nlove with each other for----\"\n\n\"Oh, Mrs. McTeague, that subject--if you would please--Miss Baker is\nsuch an estimable lady.\"\n\n\"Fiddlesticks!\" said Trina. \"You're in love with each other, and the\nwhole flat knows it; and you two have been living here side by side year\nin and year out, and you've never said a word to each other. It's all\nnonsense. Now, I want you should go right in and speak to her just as\nsoon as she comes home, and say you've come into money and you want her\nto marry you.\"\n\n\"Impossible--impossible!\" exclaimed the old Englishman, alarmed and\nperturbed. \"It's quite out of the question. I wouldn't presume.\"\n\n\"Well, do you love her, or not?\"\n\n\"Really, Mrs. McTeague, I--I--you must excuse me. It's a matter so\npersonal--so--I--Oh, yes, I love her. Oh, yes, indeed,\" he exclaimed,\nsuddenly.\n\n\"Well, then, she loves you. She told me so.\"\n\n\"Oh!\"\n\n\"She did. She said those very words.\"\n\nMiss Baker had said nothing of the kind--would have died sooner than\nhave made such a confession; but Trina had drawn her own conclusions,\nlike every other lodger of the flat, and thought the time was come for\ndecided action.\n\n\"Now you do just as I tell you, and when she comes home, go right in and\nsee her, and have it over with. Now, don't say another word. I'm going;\nbut you do just as I tell you.\"\n\nTrina turned about and went down-stairs. She had decided, since Miss\nBaker was not at home, that she would run over and see Maria; possibly\nshe could have lunch there. At any rate, Maria would offer her a cup of\ntea.\n\nOld Grannis stood for a long time just as Trina had left him, his hands\ntrembling, the blood coming and going in his withered cheeks.\n\n\"She said, she--she--she told her--she said that--that----\" he could get\nno farther.\n\nThen he faced about and entered his room, closing the door behind him.\nFor a long time he sat in his armchair, drawn close to the wall in\nfront of the table on which stood his piles of pamphlets and his little\nbinding apparatus.\n\n\"I wonder,\" said Trina, as she crossed the yard back of Zerkow's house,\n\"I wonder what rent Zerkow and Maria pay for this place. I'll bet it's\ncheaper than where Mac and I are.\"\n\nTrina found Maria sitting in front of the kitchen stove, her chin upon\nher breast. Trina went up to her. She was dead. And as Trina touched\nher shoulder, her head rolled sideways and showed a fearful gash in her\nthroat under her ear. All the front of her dress was soaked through and\nthrough.\n\nTrina backed sharply away from the body, drawing her hands up to her\nvery shoulders, her eyes staring and wide, an expression of unutterable\nhorror twisting her face.\n\n\"Oh-h-h!\" she exclaimed in a long breath, her voice hardly rising above\na whisper. \"Oh-h, isn't that horrible!\" Suddenly she turned and fled\nthrough the front part of the house to the street door, that opened upon\nthe little alley. She looked wildly about her. Directly across the way a\nbutcher's boy was getting into his two-wheeled cart drawn up in front of\nthe opposite house, while near by a peddler of wild game was coming down\nthe street, a brace of ducks in his hand.\n\n\"Oh, say--say,\" gasped Trina, trying to get her voice, \"say, come over\nhere quick.\"\n\nThe butcher's boy paused, one foot on the wheel, and stared. Trina\nbeckoned frantically.\n\n\"Come over here, come over here quick.\"\n\nThe young fellow swung himself into his seat.\n\n\"What's the matter with that woman?\" he said, half aloud.\n\n\"There's a murder been done,\" cried Trina, swaying in the doorway.\n\nThe young fellow drove away, his head over his shoulder, staring at\nTrina with eyes that were fixed and absolutely devoid of expression.\n\n\"What's the matter with that woman?\" he said again to himself as he\nturned the corner.\n\nTrina wondered why she didn't scream, how she could keep from it--how,\nat such a moment as this, she could remember that it was improper to\nmake a disturbance and create a scene in the street. The peddler of wild\ngame was looking at her suspiciously. It would not do to tell him. He\nwould go away like the butcher's boy.\n\n\"Now, wait a minute,\" Trina said to herself, speaking aloud. She put her\nhands to her head. \"Now, wait a minute. It won't do for me to lose my\nwits now. What must I do?\" She looked about her. There was the same\nfamiliar aspect of Polk Street. She could see it at the end of the\nalley. The big market opposite the flat, the delivery carts rattling up\nand down, the great ladies from the avenue at their morning shopping,\nthe cable cars trundling past, loaded with passengers. She saw a little\nboy in a flat leather cap whistling and calling for an unseen dog,\nslapping his small knee from time to time. Two men came out of Frenna's\nsaloon, laughing heartily. Heise the harness-maker stood in the\nvestibule of his shop, a bundle of whittlings in his apron of greasy\nticking. And all this was going on, people were laughing and living,\nbuying and selling, walking about out there on the sunny sidewalks,\nwhile behind her in there--in there--in there----\n\nHeise started back from the sudden apparition of a white-lipped woman\nin a blue dressing-gown that seemed to rise up before him from his very\ndoorstep.\n\n\"Well, Mrs. McTeague, you did scare me, for----\"\n\n\"Oh, come over here quick.\" Trina put her hand to her neck; swallowing\nsomething that seemed to be choking her. \"Maria's killed--Zerkow's\nwife--I found her.\"\n\n\"Get out!\" exclaimed Heise, \"you're joking.\"\n\n\"Come over here--over into the house--I found her--she's dead.\"\n\nHeise dashed across the street on the run, with Trina at his heels, a\ntrail of spilled whittlings marking his course. The two ran down the\nalley. The wild-game peddler, a woman who had been washing down the\nsteps in a neighboring house, and a man in a broad-brimmed hat stood at\nZerkow's doorway, looking in from time to time, and talking together.\nThey seemed puzzled.\n\n\"Anything wrong in here?\" asked the wild-game peddler as Heise and Trina\ncame up. Two more men stopped on the corner of the alley and Polk Street\nand looked at the group. A woman with a towel round her head raised\na window opposite Zerkow's house and called to the woman who had been\nwashing the steps, \"What is it, Mrs. Flint?\"\n\nHeise was already inside the house. He turned to Trina, panting from his\nrun.\n\n\"Where did you say--where was it--where?\"\n\n\"In there,\" said Trina, \"farther in--the next room.\" They burst into the\nkitchen.\n\n\"LORD!\" ejaculated Heise, stopping a yard or so from the body, and\nbending down to peer into the gray face with its brown lips.\n\n\"By God! he's killed her.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"Zerkow, by God! he's killed her. Cut her throat. He always said he\nwould.\"\n\n\"Zerkow?\"\n\n\"He's killed her. Her throat's cut. Good Lord, how she did bleed! By\nGod! he's done for her in good shape this time.\"\n\n\"Oh, I told her--I TOLD her,\" cried Trina.\n\n\"He's done for her SURE this time.\"\n\n\"She said she could always manage--Oh-h! It's horrible.\"\n\n\"He's done for her sure this trip. Cut her throat. LORD, how she has\nBLED! Did you ever see so much--that's murder--that's cold-blooded\nmurder. He's killed her. Say, we must get a policeman. Come on.\"\n\nThey turned back through the house. Half a dozen people--the wild-game\npeddler, the man with the broad-brimmed hat, the washwoman, and three\nother men--were in the front room of the junk shop, a bank of excited\nfaces surged at the door. Beyond this, outside, the crowd was packed\nsolid from one end of the alley to the other. Out in Polk Street the\ncable cars were nearly blocked and were bunting a way slowly through the\nthrong with clanging bells. Every window had its group. And as Trina and\nthe harness-maker tried to force the way from the door of the junk shop\nthe throng suddenly parted right and left before the passage of two\nblue-coated policemen who clove a passage through the press, working\ntheir elbows energetically. They were accompanied by a third man in\ncitizen's clothes.\n\nHeise and Trina went back into the kitchen with the two policemen, the\nthird man in citizen's clothes cleared the intruders from the front room\nof the junk shop and kept the crowd back, his arm across the open door.\n\n\"Whew!\" whistled one of the officers as they came out into the kitchen,\n\"cutting scrape? By George! SOMEBODY'S been using his knife all right.\"\nHe turned to the other officer. \"Better get the wagon. There's a box on\nthe second corner south. Now, then,\" he continued, turning to Trina and\nthe harness-maker and taking out his note-book and pencil, \"I want your\nnames and addresses.\"\n\nIt was a day of tremendous excitement for the entire street. Long after\nthe patrol wagon had driven away, the crowd remained. In fact, until\nseven o'clock that evening groups collected about the door of the junk\nshop, where a policeman stood guard, asking all manner of questions,\nadvancing all manner of opinions.\n\n\"Do you think they'll get him?\" asked Ryer of the policeman. A dozen\nnecks craned forward eagerly.\n\n\"Hoh, we'll get him all right, easy enough,\" answered the other, with a\ngrand air.\n\n\"What? What's that? What did he say?\" asked the people on the outskirts\nof the group. Those in front passed the answer back.\n\n\"He says they'll get him all right, easy enough.\"\n\nThe group looked at the policeman admiringly.\n\n\"He's skipped to San Jose.\"\n\nWhere the rumor started, and how, no one knew. But every one seemed\npersuaded that Zerkow had gone to San Jose.\n\n\"But what did he kill her for? Was he drunk?\"\n\n\"No, he was crazy, I tell you--crazy in the head. Thought she was hiding\nsome money from him.\"\n\nFrenna did a big business all day long. The murder was the one subject\nof conversation. Little parties were made up in his saloon--parties of\ntwos and threes--to go over and have a look at the outside of the junk\nshop. Heise was the most important man the length and breadth of Polk\nStreet; almost invariably he accompanied these parties, telling again\nand again of the part he had played in the affair.\n\n\"It was about eleven o'clock. I was standing in front of the shop, when\nMrs. McTeague--you know, the dentist's wife--came running across the\nstreet,\" and so on and so on.\n\nThe next day came a fresh sensation. Polk Street read of it in the\nmorning papers. Towards midnight on the day of the murder Zerkow's body\nhad been found floating in the bay near Black Point. No one knew whether\nhe had drowned himself or fallen from one of the wharves. Clutched in\nboth his hands was a sack full of old and rusty pans, tin dishes--fully\na hundred of them--tin cans, and iron knives and forks, collected from\nsome dump heap.\n\n\"And all this,\" exclaimed Trina, \"on account of a set of gold dishes\nthat never existed.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 17\n\nOne day, about a fortnight after the coroner's inquest had been held,\nand when the excitement of the terrible affair was calming down and Polk\nStreet beginning to resume its monotonous routine, Old Grannis sat in\nhis clean, well-kept little room, in his cushioned armchair, his hands\nlying idly upon his knees. It was evening; not quite time to light the\nlamps. Old Grannis had drawn his chair close to the wall--so close, in\nfact, that he could hear Miss Baker's grenadine brushing against the\nother side of the thin partition, at his very elbow, while she rocked\ngently back and forth, a cup of tea in her hands.\n\nOld Grannis's occupation was gone. That morning the bookselling firm\nwhere he had bought his pamphlets had taken his little binding apparatus\nfrom him to use as a model. The transaction had been concluded. Old\nGrannis had received his check. It was large enough, to be sure,\nbut when all was over, he returned to his room and sat there sad and\nunoccupied, looking at the pattern in the carpet and counting the heads\nof the tacks in the zinc guard that was fastened to the wall behind his\nlittle stove. By and by he heard Miss Baker moving about. It was five\no'clock, the time when she was accustomed to make her cup of tea and\n\"keep company\" with him on her side of the partition. Old Grannis drew\nup his chair to the wall near where he knew she was sitting. The minutes\npassed; side by side, and separated by only a couple of inches of board,\nthe two old people sat there together, while the afternoon grew darker.\n\nBut for Old Grannis all was different that evening. There was nothing\nfor him to do. His hands lay idly in his lap. His table, with its pile\nof pamphlets, was in a far corner of the room, and, from time to time,\nstirred with an uncertain trouble, he turned his head and looked at it\nsadly, reflecting that he would never use it again. The absence of his\naccustomed work seemed to leave something out of his life. It did not\nappear to him that he could be the same to Miss Baker now; their little\nhabits were disarranged, their customs broken up. He could no longer\nfancy himself so near to her. They would drift apart now, and she would\nno longer make herself a cup of tea and \"keep company\" with him when\nshe knew that he would never again sit before his table binding uncut\npamphlets. He had sold his happiness for money; he had bartered all his\ntardy romance for some miserable banknotes. He had not foreseen that it\nwould be like this. A vast regret welled up within him. What was that\non the back of his hand? He wiped it dry with his ancient silk\nhandkerchief.\n\nOld Grannis leant his face in his hands. Not only did an inexplicable\nregret stir within him, but a certain great tenderness came upon him.\nThe tears that swam in his faded blue eyes were not altogether those of\nunhappiness. No, this long-delayed affection that had come upon him in\nhis later years filled him with a joy for which tears seemed to be the\nnatural expression. For thirty years his eyes had not been wet, but\ntonight he felt as if he were young again. He had never loved before,\nand there was still a part of him that was only twenty years of age. He\ncould not tell whether he was profoundly sad or deeply happy; but he was\nnot ashamed of the tears that brought the smart to his eyes and the ache\nto his throat. He did not hear the timid rapping on his door, and it was\nnot until the door itself opened that he looked up quickly and saw the\nlittle retired dressmaker standing on the threshold, carrying a cup of\ntea on a tiny Japanese tray. She held it toward him.\n\n\"I was making some tea,\" she said, \"and I thought you would like to have\na cup.\"\n\nNever after could the little dressmaker understand how she had brought\nherself to do this thing. One moment she had been sitting quietly on her\nside of the partition, stirring her cup of tea with one of her Gorham\nspoons. She was quiet, she was peaceful. The evening was closing\ndown tranquilly. Her room was the picture of calmness and order. The\ngeraniums blooming in the starch boxes in the window, the aged goldfish\noccasionally turning his iridescent flank to catch a sudden glow of the\nsetting sun. The next moment she had been all trepidation. It seemed to\nher the most natural thing in the world to make a steaming cup of tea\nand carry it in to Old Grannis next door. It seemed to her that he was\nwanting her, that she ought to go to him. With the brusque resolve and\nintrepidity that sometimes seizes upon very timid people--the courage of\nthe coward greater than all others--she had presented herself at the old\nEnglishman's half-open door, and, when he had not heeded her knock,\nhad pushed it open, and at last, after all these years, stood upon\nthe threshold of his room. She had found courage enough to explain her\nintrusion.\n\n\"I was making some tea, and I thought you would like to have a cup.\"\n\nOld Grannis dropped his hands upon either arm of his chair, and, leaning\nforward a little, looked at her blankly. He did not speak.\n\nThe retired dressmaker's courage had carried her thus far; now it\ndeserted her as abruptly as it had come. Her cheeks became scarlet; her\nfunny little false curls trembled with her agitation. What she had done\nseemed to her indecorous beyond expression. It was an enormity. Fancy,\nshe had gone into his room, INTO HIS ROOM--Mister Grannis's room. She\nhad done this--she who could not pass him on the stairs without a qualm.\nWhat to do she did not know. She stood, a fixture, on the threshold of\nhis room, without even resolution enough to beat a retreat. Helplessly,\nand with a little quaver in her voice, she repeated obstinately:\n\n\"I was making some tea, and I thought you would like to have a cup of\ntea.\" Her agitation betrayed itself in the repetition of the word. She\nfelt that she could not hold the tray out another instant. Already she\nwas trembling so that half the tea was spilled.\n\nOld Grannis still kept silence, still bending forward, with wide eyes,\nhis hands gripping the arms of his chair.\n\nThen with the tea-tray still held straight before her, the little\ndressmaker exclaimed tearfully:\n\n\"Oh, I didn't mean--I didn't mean--I didn't know it would seem like\nthis. I only meant to be kind and bring you some tea; and now it seems\nSO improper. I--I--I'm SO ashamed! I don't know what you will think\nof me. I--\" she caught her breath--\"improper\"--she managed to exclaim,\n\"unlady-like--you can never think well of me--I'll go. I'll go.\" She\nturned about.\n\n\"Stop,\" cried Old Grannis, finding his voice at last. Miss Baker paused,\nlooking at him over her shoulder, her eyes very wide open, blinking\nthrough her tears, for all the world like a frightened child.\n\n\"Stop,\" exclaimed the old Englishman, rising to his feet. \"I didn't know\nit was you at first. I hadn't dreamed--I couldn't believe you would be\nso good, so kind to me. Oh,\" he cried, with a sudden sharp breath, \"oh,\nyou ARE kind. I--I--you have--have made me very happy.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" exclaimed Miss Baker, ready to sob. \"It was unlady-like. You\nwill--you must think ill of me.\" She stood in the hall. The tears were\nrunning down her cheeks, and she had no free hand to dry them.\n\n\"Let me--I'll take the tray from you,\" cried Old Grannis, coming\nforward. A tremulous joy came upon him. Never in his life had he been\nso happy. At last it had come--come when he had least expected it. That\nwhich he had longed for and hoped for through so many years, behold, it\nwas come to-night. He felt his awkwardness leaving him. He was almost\ncertain that the little dressmaker loved him, and the thought gave him\nboldness. He came toward her and took the tray from her hands, and,\nturning back into the room with it, made as if to set it upon his table.\nBut the piles of his pamphlets were in the way. Both of his hands were\noccupied with the tray; he could not make a place for it on the table.\nHe stood for a moment uncertain, his embarrassment returning.\n\n\"Oh, won't you--won't you please--\" He turned his head, looking\nappealingly at the little old dressmaker.\n\n\"Wait, I'll help you,\" she said. She came into the room, up to the\ntable, and moved the pamphlets to one side.\n\n\"Thanks, thanks,\" murmured Old Grannis, setting down the tray.\n\n\"Now--now--now I will go back,\" she exclaimed, hurriedly.\n\n\"No--no,\" returned the old Englishman. \"Don't go, don't go. I've been\nso lonely to-night--and last night too--all this year--all my life,\" he\nsuddenly cried.\n\n\"I--I--I've forgotten the sugar.\"\n\n\"But I never take sugar in my tea.\"\n\n\"But it's rather cold, and I've spilled it--almost all of it.\"\n\n\"I'll drink it from the saucer.\" Old Grannis had drawn up his armchair\nfor her.\n\n\"Oh, I shouldn't. This is--this is SO--You must think ill of me.\"\nSuddenly she sat down, and resting her elbows on the table, hid her face\nin her hands.\n\n\"Think ILL of you?\" cried Old Grannis, \"think ILL of you? Why, you don't\nknow--you have no idea--all these years--living so close to you, I--I--\"\nhe paused suddenly. It seemed to him as if the beating of his heart was\nchoking him.\n\n\"I thought you were binding your books to-night,\" said Miss Baker,\nsuddenly, \"and you looked tired. I thought you looked tired when I last\nsaw you, and a cup of tea, you know, it--that--that does you so much\ngood when you're tired. But you weren't binding books.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" returned Old Grannis, drawing up a chair and sitting down.\n\"No, I--the fact is, I've sold my apparatus; a firm of booksellers has\nbought the rights of it.\"\n\n\"And aren't you going to bind books any more?\" exclaimed the little\ndressmaker, a shade of disappointment in her manner. \"I thought you\nalways did about four o'clock. I used to hear you when I was making\ntea.\"\n\nIt hardly seemed possible to Miss Baker that she was actually talking to\nOld Grannis, that the two were really chatting together, face to face,\nand without the dreadful embarrassment that used to overwhelm them both\nwhen they met on the stairs. She had often dreamed of this, but had\nalways put it off to some far-distant day. It was to come gradually,\nlittle by little, instead of, as now, abruptly and with no preparation.\nThat she should permit herself the indiscretion of actually intruding\nherself into his room had never so much as occurred to her. Yet here she\nwas, IN HIS ROOM, and they were talking together, and little by little\nher embarrassment was wearing away.\n\n\"Yes, yes, I always heard you when you were making tea,\" returned the\nold Englishman; \"I heard the tea things. Then I used to draw my chair\nand my work-table close to the wall on my side, and sit there and work\nwhile you drank your tea just on the other side; and I used to feel very\nnear to you then. I used to pass the whole evening that way.\"\n\n\"And, yes--yes--I did too,\" she answered. \"I used to make tea just at\nthat time and sit there for a whole hour.\"\n\n\"And didn't you sit close to the partition on your side? Sometimes I\nwas sure of it. I could even fancy that I could hear your dress brushing\nagainst the wall-paper close beside me. Didn't you sit close to the\npartition?\"\n\n\"I--I don't know where I sat.\"\n\nOld Grannis shyly put out his hand and took hers as it lay upon her lap.\n\n\"Didn't you sit close to the partition on your side?\" he insisted.\n\n\"No--I don't know--perhaps--sometimes. Oh, yes,\" she exclaimed, with a\nlittle gasp, \"Oh, yes, I often did.\"\n\nThen Old Grannis put his arm about her, and kissed her faded cheek, that\nflushed to pink upon the instant.\n\nAfter that they spoke but little. The day lapsed slowly into twilight,\nand the two old people sat there in the gray evening, quietly, quietly,\ntheir hands in each other's hands, \"keeping company,\" but now with\nnothing to separate them. It had come at last. After all these years\nthey were together; they understood each other. They stood at length in\na little Elysium of their own creating. They walked hand in hand in\na delicious garden where it was always autumn. Far from the world\nand together they entered upon the long retarded romance of their\ncommonplace and uneventful lives.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 18\n\n\nThat same night McTeague was awakened by a shrill scream, and woke\nto find Trina's arms around his neck. She was trembling so that the\nbed-springs creaked.\n\n\"Huh?\" cried the dentist, sitting up in bed, raising his clinched fists.\n\"Huh? What? What? What is it? What is it?\"\n\n\"Oh, Mac,\" gasped his wife, \"I had such an awful dream. I dreamed about\nMaria. I thought she was chasing me, and I couldn't run, and her throat\nwas--Oh, she was all covered with blood. Oh-h, I am so frightened!\"\n\nTrina had borne up very well for the first day or so after the affair,\nand had given her testimony to the coroner with far greater calmness\nthan Heise. It was only a week later that the horror of the thing came\nupon her again. She was so nervous that she hardly dared to be alone in\nthe daytime, and almost every night woke with a cry of terror, trembling\nwith the recollection of some dreadful nightmare. The dentist was\nirritated beyond all expression by her nervousness, and especially was\nhe exasperated when her cries woke him suddenly in the middle of the\nnight. He would sit up in bed, rolling his eyes wildly, throwing out\nhis huge fists--at what, he did not know--exclaiming, \"What what--\"\nbewildered and hopelessly confused. Then when he realized that it was\nonly Trina, his anger kindled abruptly.\n\n\"Oh, you and your dreams! You go to sleep, or I'll give you a dressing\ndown.\" Sometimes he would hit her a great thwack with his open palm, or\ncatch her hand and bite the tips of her fingers. Trina would lie awake\nfor hours afterward, crying softly to herself. Then, by and by, \"Mac,\"\nshe would say timidly.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Mac, do you love me?\"\n\n\"Huh? What? Go to sleep.\"\n\n\"Don't you love me any more, Mac?\"\n\n\"Oh, go to sleep. Don't bother me.\"\n\n\"Well, do you LOVE me, Mac?\"\n\n\"I guess so.\"\n\n\"Oh, Mac, I've only you now, and if you don't love me, what is going to\nbecome of me?\"\n\n\"Shut up, an' let me go to sleep.\"\n\n\"Well, just tell me that you love me.\"\n\nThe dentist would turn abruptly away from her, burying his big blond\nhead in the pillow, and covering up his ears with the blankets. Then\nTrina would sob herself to sleep.\n\nThe dentist had long since given up looking for a job. Between breakfast\nand supper time Trina saw but little of him. Once the morning meal over,\nMcTeague bestirred himself, put on his cap--he had given up wearing even\na hat since his wife had made him sell his silk hat--and went out. He\nhad fallen into the habit of taking long and solitary walks beyond the\nsuburbs of the city. Sometimes it was to the Cliff House, occasionally\nto the Park (where he would sit on the sun-warmed benches, smoking his\npipe and reading ragged ends of old newspapers), but more often it was\nto the Presidio Reservation. McTeague would walk out to the end of the\nUnion Street car line, entering the Reservation at the terminus, then\nhe would work down to the shore of the bay, follow the shore line to\nthe Old Fort at the Golden Gate, and, turning the Point here, come out\nsuddenly upon the full sweep of the Pacific. Then he would follow the\nbeach down to a certain point of rocks that he knew. Here he would turn\ninland, climbing the bluffs to a rolling grassy down sown with blue iris\nand a yellow flower that he did not know the name of. On the far side of\nthis down was a broad, well-kept road. McTeague would keep to this road\nuntil he reached the city again by the way of the Sacramento Street car\nline. The dentist loved these walks. He liked to be alone. He liked the\nsolitude of the tremendous, tumbling ocean; the fresh, windy downs; he\nliked to feel the gusty Trades flogging his face, and he would remain\nfor hours watching the roll and plunge of the breakers with the silent,\nunreasoned enjoyment of a child. All at once he developed a passion for\nfishing. He would sit all day nearly motionless upon a point of rocks,\nhis fish-line between his fingers, happy if he caught three perch in\ntwelve hours. At noon he would retire to a bit of level turf around an\nangle of the shore and cook his fish, eating them without salt or knife\nor fork. He thrust a pointed stick down the mouth of the perch, and\nturned it slowly over the blaze. When the grease stopped dripping, he\nknew that it was done, and would devour it slowly and with tremendous\nrelish, picking the bones clean, eating even the head. He remembered\nhow often he used to do this sort of thing when he was a boy in the\nmountains of Placer County, before he became a car-boy at the mine. The\ndentist enjoyed himself hugely during these days. The instincts of the\nold-time miner were returning. In the stress of his misfortune McTeague\nwas lapsing back to his early estate.\n\nOne evening as he reached home after such a tramp, he was surprised to\nfind Trina standing in front of what had been Zerkow's house, looking at\nit thoughtfully, her finger on her lips.\n\n\"What you doing here'?\" growled the dentist as he came up. There was a\n\"Rooms-to-let\" sign on the street door of the house.\n\n\"Now we've found a place to move to,\" exclaimed Trina.\n\n\"What?\" cried McTeague. \"There, in that dirty house, where you found\nMaria?\"\n\n\"I can't afford that room in the flat any more, now that you can't get\nany work to do.\"\n\n\"But there's where Zerkow killed Maria--the very house--an' you wake up\nan' squeal in the night just thinking of it.\"\n\n\"I know. I know it will be bad at first, but I'll get used to it, an'\nit's just half again as cheap as where we are now. I was looking at a\nroom; we can have it dirt cheap. It's a back room over the kitchen. A\nGerman family are going to take the front part of the house and sublet\nthe rest. I'm going to take it. It'll be money in my pocket.\"\n\n\"But it won't be any in mine,\" vociferated the dentist, angrily. \"I'll\nhave to live in that dirty rat hole just so's you can save money. I\nain't any the better off for it.\"\n\n\"Find work to do, and then we'll talk,\" declared Trina. \"I'M going to\nsave up some money against a rainy day; and if I can save more by living\nhere I'm going to do it, even if it is the house Maria was killed in. I\ndon't care.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said McTeague, and did not make any further protest. His\nwife looked at him surprised. She could not understand this sudden\nacquiescence. Perhaps McTeague was so much away from home of late that\nhe had ceased to care where or how he lived. But this sudden change\ntroubled her a little for all that.\n\nThe next day the McTeagues moved for a second time. It did not take them\nlong. They were obliged to buy the bed from the landlady, a circumstance\nwhich nearly broke Trina's heart; and this bed, a couple of chairs,\nTrina's trunk, an ornament or two, the oil stove, and some plates and\nkitchen ware were all that they could call their own now; and this back\nroom in that wretched house with its grisly memories, the one window\nlooking out into a grimy maze of back yards and broken sheds, was what\nthey now knew as their home.\n\nThe McTeagues now began to sink rapidly lower and lower. They became\naccustomed to their surroundings. Worst of all, Trina lost her pretty\nways and her good looks. The combined effects of hard work, avarice,\npoor food, and her husband's brutalities told on her swiftly. Her\ncharming little figure grew coarse, stunted, and dumpy. She who had once\nbeen of a catlike neatness, now slovened all day about the room in\na dirty flannel wrapper, her slippers clap-clapping after her as she\nwalked. At last she even neglected her hair, the wonderful swarthy\ntiara, the coiffure of a queen, that shaded her little pale forehead.\nIn the morning she braided it before it was half combed, and piled and\ncoiled it about her head in haphazard fashion. It came down half a dozen\ntimes a day; by evening it was an unkempt, tangled mass, a veritable\nrat's nest.\n\nAh, no, it was not very gay, that life of hers, when one had to rustle\nfor two, cook and work and wash, to say nothing of paying the rent. What\nodds was it if she was slatternly, dirty, coarse? Was there time to make\nherself look otherwise, and who was there to be pleased when she was all\nprinked out? Surely not a great brute of a husband who bit you like a\ndog, and kicked and pounded you as though you were made of iron. Ah, no,\nbetter let things go, and take it as easy as you could. Hump your back,\nand it was soonest over.\n\nThe one room grew abominably dirty, reeking with the odors of cooking\nand of \"non-poisonous\" paint. The bed was not made until late in the\nafternoon, sometimes not at all. Dirty, unwashed crockery, greasy\nknives, sodden fragments of yesterday's meals cluttered the table, while\nin one corner was the heap of evil-smelling, dirty linen. Cockroaches\nappeared in the crevices of the woodwork, the wall-paper bulged from the\ndamp walls and began to peel. Trina had long ago ceased to dust or to\nwipe the furniture with a bit of rag. The grime grew thick upon the\nwindow panes and in the corners of the room. All the filth of the alley\ninvaded their quarters like a rising muddy tide.\n\nBetween the windows, however, the faded photograph of the couple in\ntheir wedding finery looked down upon the wretchedness, Trina still\nholding her set bouquet straight before her, McTeague standing at her\nside, his left foot forward, in the attitude of a Secretary of State;\nwhile near by hung the canary, the one thing the dentist clung to\nobstinately, piping and chittering all day in its little gilt prison.\n\nAnd the tooth, the gigantic golden molar of French gilt, enormous and\nungainly, sprawled its branching prongs in one corner of the room, by\nthe footboard of the bed. The McTeague's had come to use it as a sort\nof substitute for a table. After breakfast and supper Trina piled the\nplates and greasy dishes upon it to have them out of the way.\n\nOne afternoon the Other Dentist, McTeague's old-time rival, the wearer\nof marvellous waistcoats, was surprised out of all countenance to\nreceive a visit from McTeague. The Other Dentist was in his operating\nroom at the time, at work upon a plaster-of-paris mould. To his call\nof \"'Come right in. Don't you see the sign, 'Enter without knocking'?\"\nMcTeague came in. He noted at once how airy and cheerful was the room. A\nlittle fire coughed and tittered on the hearth, a brindled greyhound\nsat on his haunches watching it intently, a great mirror over the mantle\noffered to view an array of actresses' pictures thrust between the glass\nand the frame, and a big bunch of freshly-cut violets stood in a glass\nbowl on the polished cherrywood table. The Other Dentist came forward\nbriskly, exclaiming cheerfully:\n\n\"Oh, Doctor--Mister McTeague, how do? how do?\"\n\nThe fellow was actually wearing a velvet smoking jacket. A cigarette\nwas between his lips; his patent leather boots reflected the firelight.\nMcTeague wore a black surah neglige shirt without a cravat; huge buckled\nbrogans, hob-nailed, gross, encased his feet; the hems of his trousers\nwere spotted with mud; his coat was frayed at the sleeves and a button\nwas gone. In three days he had not shaved; his shock of heavy blond hair\nescaped from beneath the visor of his woollen cap and hung low over his\nforehead. He stood with awkward, shifting feet and uncertain eyes before\nthe dapper young fellow who reeked of the barber shop, and whom he had\nonce ordered from his rooms.\n\n\"What can I do for you this morning, Mister McTeague? Something wrong\nwith the teeth, eh?\"\n\n\"No, no.\" McTeague, floundering in the difficulties of his speech,\nforgot the carefully rehearsed words with which he had intended to begin\nthis interview.\n\n\"I want to sell you my sign,\" he said, stupidly. \"That big tooth of\nFrench gilt--YOU know--that you made an offer for once.\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't want that now,\" said the other loftily. \"I prefer a little\nquiet signboard, nothing pretentious--just the name, and 'Dentist' after\nit. These big signs are vulgar. No, I don't want it.\"\n\nMcTeague remained, looking about on the floor, horribly embarrassed, not\nknowing whether to go or to stay.\n\n\"But I don't know,\" said the Other Dentist, reflectively. \"If it will\nhelp you out any--I guess you're pretty hard up--I'll--well, I tell you\nwhat--I'll give you five dollars for it.\"\n\n\"All right, all right.\"\n\nOn the following Thursday morning McTeague woke to hear the eaves\ndripping and the prolonged rattle of the rain upon the roof.\n\n\"Raining,\" he growled, in deep disgust, sitting up in bed, and winking\nat the blurred window.\n\n\"It's been raining all night,\" said Trina. She was already up and\ndressed, and was cooking breakfast on the oil stove.\n\nMcTeague dressed himself, grumbling, \"Well, I'll go, anyhow. The fish\nwill bite all the better for the rain.\"\n\n\"Look here, Mac,\" said Trina, slicing a bit of bacon as thinly as she\ncould. \"Look here, why don't you bring some of your fish home sometime?\"\n\n\"Huh!\" snorted the dentist, \"so's we could have 'em for breakfast. Might\nsave you a nickel, mightn't it?\"\n\n\"Well, and if it did! Or you might fish for the market. The fisherman\nacross the street would buy 'em of you.\"\n\n\"Shut up!\" exclaimed the dentist, and Trina obediently subsided.\n\n\"Look here,\" continued her husband, fumbling in his trousers pocket\nand bringing out a dollar, \"I'm sick and tired of coffee and bacon and\nmashed potatoes. Go over to the market and get some kind of meat for\nbreakfast. Get a steak, or chops, or something.\n\n\"Why, Mac, that's a whole dollar, and he only gave you five for your\nsign. We can't afford it. Sure, Mac. Let me put that money away against\na rainy day. You're just as well off without meat for breakfast.\"\n\n\"You do as I tell you. Get some steak, or chops, or something.\"\n\n\"Please, Mac, dear.\"\n\n\"Go on, now. I'll bite your fingers again pretty soon.\"\n\n\"But----\"\n\nThe dentist took a step towards her, snatching at her hand.\n\n\"All right, I'll go,\" cried Trina, wincing and shrinking. \"I'll go.\"\n\nShe did not get the chops at the big market, however. Instead, she\nhurried to a cheaper butcher shop on a side street two blocks away, and\nbought fifteen cents' worth of chops from a side of mutton some two or\nthree days old. She was gone some little time.\n\n\"Give me the change,\" exclaimed the dentist as soon as she returned.\nTrina handed him a quarter; and when McTeague was about to protest,\nbroke in upon him with a rapid stream of talk that confused him upon\nthe instant. But for that matter, it was never difficult for Trina to\ndeceive the dentist. He never went to the bottom of things. He would\nhave believed her if she had told him the chops had cost a dollar.\n\n\"There's sixty cents saved, anyhow,\" thought Trina, as she clutched the\nmoney in her pocket to keep it from rattling.\n\nTrina cooked the chops, and they breakfasted in silence. \"Now,\" said\nMcTeague as he rose, wiping the coffee from his thick mustache with the\nhollow of his palm, \"now I'm going fishing, rain or no rain. I'm going\nto be gone all day.\"\n\nHe stood for a moment at the door, his fish-line in his hand, swinging\nthe heavy sinker back and forth. He looked at Trina as she cleared away\nthe breakfast things.\n\n\"So long,\" said he, nodding his huge square-cut head. This amiability\nin the matter of leave taking was unusual. Trina put the dishes down and\ncame up to him, her little chin, once so adorable, in the air:\n\n\"Kiss me good-by, Mac,\" she said, putting her arms around his neck. \"You\nDO love me a little yet, don't you, Mac? We'll be happy again some day.\nThis is hard times now, but we'll pull out. You'll find something to do\npretty soon.\"\n\n\"I guess so,\" growled McTeague, allowing her to kiss him.\n\nThe canary was stirring nimbly in its cage, and just now broke out into\na shrill trilling, its little throat bulging and quivering. The dentist\nstared at it. \"Say,\" he remarked slowly, \"I think I'll take that bird of\nmine along.\"\n\n\"Sell it?\" inquired Trina.\n\n\"Yes, yes, sell it.\"\n\n\"Well, you ARE coming to your senses at last,\" answered Trina,\napprovingly. \"But don't you let the bird-store man cheat you. That's a\ngood songster; and with the cage, you ought to make him give you five\ndollars. You stick out for that at first, anyhow.\"\n\nMcTeague unhooked the cage and carefully wrapped it in an old newspaper,\nremarking, \"He might get cold. Well, so long,\" he repeated, \"so long.\"\n\n\"Good-by, Mac.\"\n\nWhen he was gone, Trina took the sixty cents she had stolen from him out\nof her pocket and recounted it. \"It's sixty cents, all right,\" she said\nproudly. \"But I DO believe that dime is too smooth.\" She looked at it\ncritically. The clock on the power-house of the Sutter Street cable\nstruck eight. \"Eight o'clock already,\" she exclaimed. \"I must get to\nwork.\" She cleared the breakfast things from the table, and drawing up\nher chair and her workbox began painting the sets of Noah's ark animals\nshe had whittled the day before. She worked steadily all the morning.\nAt noon she lunched, warming over the coffee left from breakfast, and\nfrying a couple of sausages. By one she was bending over her table\nagain. Her fingers--some of them lacerated by McTeague's teeth--flew,\nand the little pile of cheap toys in the basket at her elbow grew\nsteadily.\n\n\"Where DO all the toys go to?\" she murmured. \"The thousands and\nthousands of these Noah's arks that I have made--horses and chickens and\nelephants--and always there never seems to be enough. It's a good thing\nfor me that children break their things, and that they all have to have\nbirthdays and Christmases.\" She dipped her brush into a pot of Vandyke\nbrown and painted one of the whittled toy horses in two strokes. Then a\ntouch of ivory black with a small flat brush created the tail and mane,\nand dots of Chinese white made the eyes. The turpentine in the paint\ndried it almost immediately, and she tossed the completed little horse\ninto the basket.\n\nAt six o'clock the dentist had not returned. Trina waited until seven,\nand then put her work away, and ate her supper alone.\n\n\"I wonder what's keeping Mac,\" she exclaimed as the clock from the\npower-house on Sutter Street struck half-past seven. \"I KNOW he's\ndrinking somewhere,\" she cried, apprehensively. \"He had the money from\nhis sign with him.\"\n\nAt eight o'clock she threw a shawl over her head and went over to the\nharness shop. If anybody would know where McTeague was it would be\nHeise. But the harness-maker had seen nothing of him since the day\nbefore.\n\n\"He was in here yesterday afternoon, and we had a drink or two at\nFrenna's. Maybe he's been in there to-day.\"\n\n\"Oh, won't you go in and see?\" said Trina. \"Mac always came home to his\nsupper--he never likes to miss his meals--and I'm getting frightened\nabout him.\"\n\nHeise went into the barroom next door, and returned with no definite\nnews. Frenna had not seen the dentist since he had come in with the\nharness-maker the previous afternoon. Trina even humbled herself to ask\nof the Ryers--with whom they had quarrelled--if they knew anything of\nthe dentist's whereabouts, but received a contemptuous negative.\n\n\"Maybe he's come in while I've been out,\" said Trina to herself. She\nwent down Polk Street again, going towards the flat. The rain had\nstopped, but the sidewalks were still glistening. The cable cars\ntrundled by, loaded with theatregoers. The barbers were just closing\ntheir shops. The candy store on the corner was brilliantly lighted and\nwas filling up, while the green and yellow lamps from the drug store\ndirectly opposite threw kaleidoscopic reflections deep down into the\nshining surface of the asphalt. A band of Salvationists began to play\nand pray in front of Frenna's saloon. Trina hurried on down the gay\nstreet, with its evening's brilliancy and small activities, her shawl\nover her head, one hand lifting her faded skirt from off the wet\npavements. She turned into the alley, entered Zerkow's old home by the\never-open door, and ran up-stairs to the room. Nobody.\n\n\"Why, isn't this FUNNY,\" she exclaimed, half aloud, standing on the\nthreshold, her little milk-white forehead curdling to a frown, one sore\nfinger on her lips. Then a great fear seized upon her. Inevitably she\nassociated the house with a scene of violent death.\n\n\"No, no,\" she said to the darkness, \"Mac is all right. HE can take\ncare of himself.\" But for all that she had a clear-cut vision of her\nhusband's body, bloated with seawater, his blond hair streaming like\nkelp, rolling inertly in shifting waters.\n\n\"He couldn't have fallen off the rocks,\" she declared firmly.\n\"There--THERE he is now.\" She heaved a great sigh of relief as a heavy\ntread sounded in the hallway below. She ran to the banisters, looking\nover, and calling, \"Oh, Mac! Is that you, Mac?\" It was the German whose\nfamily occupied the lower floor. The power-house clock struck nine.\n\n\"My God, where is Mac?\" cried Trina, stamping her foot.\n\nShe put the shawl over her head again, and went out and stood on the\ncorner of the alley and Polk Street, watching and waiting, craning her\nneck to see down the street. Once, even, she went out upon the sidewalk\nin front of the flat and sat down for a moment upon the horse-block\nthere. She could not help remembering the day when she had been driven\nup to that horse-block in a hack. Her mother and father and Owgooste and\nthe twins were with her. It was her wedding day. Her wedding dress was\nin a huge tin trunk on the driver's seat. She had never been happier\nbefore in all her life. She remembered how she got out of the hack\nand stood for a moment upon the horse-block, looking up at McTeague's\nwindows. She had caught a glimpse of him at his shaving, the lather\nstill on his cheek, and they had waved their hands at each other.\nInstinctively Trina looked up at the flat behind her; looked up at the\nbay window where her husband's \"Dental Parlors\" had been. It was all\ndark; the windows had the blind, sightless appearance imparted by\nvacant, untenanted rooms. A rusty iron rod projected mournfully from one\nof the window ledges.\n\n\"There's where our sign hung once,\" said Trina. She turned her head and\nlooked down Polk Street towards where the Other Dentist had his rooms,\nand there, overhanging the street from his window, newly furbished and\nbrightened, hung the huge tooth, her birthday present to her husband,\nflashing and glowing in the white glare of the electric lights like a\nbeacon of defiance and triumph.\n\n\"Ah, no; ah, no,\" whispered Trina, choking back a sob. \"Life isn't so\ngay. But I wouldn't mind, no I wouldn't mind anything, if only Mac was\nhome all right.\" She got up from the horse-block and stood again on the\ncorner of the alley, watching and listening.\n\nIt grew later. The hours passed. Trina kept at her post. The noise of\napproaching footfalls grew less and less frequent. Little by little\nPolk Street dropped back into solitude. Eleven o'clock struck from the\npower-house clock; lights were extinguished; at one o'clock the cable\nstopped, leaving an abrupt and numbing silence in the air. All at once\nit seemed very still. The only noises were the occasional footfalls of\na policeman and the persistent calling of ducks and geese in the closed\nmarket across the way. The street was asleep.\n\nWhen it is night and dark, and one is awake and alone, one's thoughts\ntake the color of the surroundings; become gloomy, sombre, and very\ndismal. All at once an idea came to Trina, a dark, terrible idea; worse,\neven, than the idea of McTeague's death.\n\n\"Oh, no,\" she cried. \"Oh, no. It isn't true. But suppose--suppose.\"\n\nShe left her post and hurried back to the house.\n\n\"No, no,\" she was saying under her breath, \"it isn't possible.\nMaybe he's even come home already by another way. But\nsuppose--suppose--suppose.\"\n\nShe ran up the stairs, opened the door of the room, and paused, out of\nbreath. The room was dark and empty. With cold, trembling fingers she\nlighted the lamp, and, turning about, looked at her trunk. The lock was\nburst.\n\n\"No, no, no,\" cried Trina, \"it's not true; it's not true.\" She dropped\non her knees before the trunk, and tossed back the lid, and plunged\nher hands down into the corner underneath her wedding dress, where she\nalways kept the savings. The brass match-safe and the chamois-skin bag\nwere there. They were empty.\n\nTrina flung herself full length upon the floor, burying her face in her\narms, rolling her head from side to side. Her voice rose to a wail.\n\n\"No, no, no, it's not true; it's not true; it's not true. Oh, he\ncouldn't have done it. Oh, how could he have done it? All my money, all\nmy little savings--and deserted me. He's gone, my money's gone, my dear\nmoney--my dear, dear gold pieces that I've worked so hard for. Oh, to\nhave deserted me--gone for good--gone and never coming back--gone with\nmy gold pieces. Gone-gone--gone. I'll never see them again, and I've\nworked so hard, so so hard for him--for them. No, no, NO, it's not true.\nIt IS true. What will become of me now? Oh, if you'll only come back you\ncan have all the money--half of it. Oh, give me back my money. Give me\nback my money, and I'll forgive you. You can leave me then if you want\nto. Oh, my money. Mac, Mac, you've gone for good. You don't love me any\nmore, and now I'm a beggar. My money's gone, my husband's gone, gone,\ngone, gone!\"\n\nHer grief was terrible. She dug her nails into her scalp, and clutching\nthe heavy coils of her thick black hair tore it again and again. She\nstruck her forehead with her clenched fists. Her little body shook from\nhead to foot with the violence of her sobbing. She ground her small\nteeth together and beat her head upon the floor with all her strength.\n\nHer hair was uncoiled and hanging a tangled, dishevelled mass far below\nher waist; her dress was torn; a spot of blood was upon her forehead;\nher eyes were swollen; her cheeks flamed vermilion from the fever that\nraged in her veins. Old Miss Baker found her thus towards five o'clock\nthe next morning.\n\nWhat had happened between one o'clock and dawn of that fearful night\nTrina never remembered. She could only recall herself, as in a picture,\nkneeling before her broken and rifled trunk, and then--weeks later, so\nit seemed to her--she woke to find herself in her own bed with an iced\nbandage about her forehead and the little old dressmaker at her side,\nstroking her hot, dry palm.\n\nThe facts of the matter were that the German woman who lived below\nhad been awakened some hours after midnight by the sounds of Trina's\nweeping. She had come upstairs and into the room to find Trina stretched\nface downward upon the floor, half-conscious and sobbing, in the throes\nof an hysteria for which there was no relief. The woman, terrified, had\ncalled her husband, and between them they had got Trina upon the bed.\nThen the German woman happened to remember that Trina had friends in\nthe big flat near by, and had sent her husband to fetch the retired\ndressmaker, while she herself remained behind to undress Trina and put\nher to bed. Miss Baker had come over at once, and began to cry herself\nat the sight of the dentist's poor little wife. She did not stop to ask\nwhat the trouble was, and indeed it would have been useless to attempt\nto get any coherent explanation from Trina at that time. Miss Baker\nhad sent the German woman's husband to get some ice at one of the\n\"all-night\" restaurants of the street; had kept cold, wet towels on\nTrina's head; had combed and recombed her wonderful thick hair; and had\nsat down by the side of the bed, holding her hot hand, with its poor\nmaimed fingers, waiting patiently until Trina should be able to speak.\n\nTowards morning Trina awoke--or perhaps it was a mere regaining of\nconsciousness--looked a moment at Miss Baker, then about the room until\nher eyes fell upon her trunk with its broken lock. Then she turned over\nupon the pillow and began to sob again. She refused to answer any of\nthe little dressmaker's questions, shaking her head violently, her face\nhidden in the pillow.\n\nBy breakfast time her fever had increased to such a point that Miss\nBaker took matters into her own hands and had the German woman call\na doctor. He arrived some twenty minutes later. He was a big, kindly\nfellow who lived over the drug store on the corner. He had a deep voice\nand a tremendous striding gait less suggestive of a physician than of a\nsergeant of a cavalry troop.\n\nBy the time of his arrival little Miss Baker had divined intuitively\nthe entire trouble. She heard the doctor's swinging tramp in the entry\nbelow, and heard the German woman saying:\n\n\"Righd oop der stairs, at der back of der halle. Der room mit der door\noppen.\"\n\nMiss Baker met the doctor at the landing, she told him in a whisper of\nthe trouble.\n\n\"Her husband's deserted her, I'm afraid, doctor, and took all of her\nmoney--a good deal of it. It's about killed the poor child. She was out\nof her head a good deal of the night, and now she's got a raging fever.\"\n\nThe doctor and Miss Baker returned to the room and entered, closing the\ndoor. The big doctor stood for a moment looking down at Trina rolling\nher head from side to side upon the pillow, her face scarlet, her\nenormous mane of hair spread out on either side of her. The little\ndressmaker remained at his elbow, looking from him to Trina.\n\n\"Poor little woman!\" said the doctor; \"poor little woman!\"\n\nMiss Baker pointed to the trunk, whispering:\n\n\"See, there's where she kept her savings. See, he broke the lock.\"\n\n\"Well, Mrs. McTeague,\" said the doctor, sitting down by the bed, and\ntaking Trina's wrist, \"a little fever, eh?\"\n\nTrina opened her eyes and looked at him, and then at Miss Baker. She did\nnot seem in the least surprised at the unfamiliar faces. She appeared to\nconsider it all as a matter of course.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, with a long, tremulous breath, \"I have a fever, and my\nhead--my head aches and aches.\"\n\nThe doctor prescribed rest and mild opiates. Then his eye fell upon the\nfingers of Trina's right hand. He looked at them sharply. A deep\nred glow, unmistakable to a physician's eyes, was upon some of them,\nextending from the finger tips up to the second knuckle.\n\n\"Hello,\" he exclaimed, \"what's the matter here?\" In fact something was\nvery wrong indeed. For days Trina had noticed it. The fingers of her\nright hand had swollen as never before, aching and discolored. Cruelly\nlacerated by McTeague's brutality as they were, she had nevertheless\ngone on about her work on the Noah's ark animals, constantly in contact\nwith the \"non-poisonous\" paint. She told as much to the doctor in answer\nto his questions. He shook his head with an exclamation.\n\n\"Why, this is blood-poisoning, you know,\" he told her; \"the worst kind.\nYou'll have to have those fingers amputated, beyond a doubt, or lose the\nentire hand--or even worse.\"\n\n\"And my work!\" exclaimed Trina.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 19\n\n\nOne can hold a scrubbing-brush with two good fingers and the stumps\nof two others even if both joints of the thumb are gone, but it takes\nconsiderable practice to get used to it.\n\nTrina became a scrub-woman. She had taken council of Selina, and\nthrough her had obtained the position of caretaker in a little memorial\nkindergarten over on Pacific Street. Like Polk Street, it was an\naccommodation street, but running through a much poorer and more sordid\nquarter. Trina had a little room over the kindergarten schoolroom. It\nwas not an unpleasant room. It looked out upon a sunny little court\nfloored with boards and used as the children's playground. Two great\ncherry trees grew here, the leaves almost brushing against the window of\nTrina's room and filtering the sunlight so that it fell in round golden\nspots upon the floor of the room. \"Like gold pieces,\" Trina said to\nherself.\n\nTrina's work consisted in taking care of the kindergarten rooms,\nscrubbing the floors, washing the windows, dusting and airing, and\ncarrying out the ashes. Besides this she earned some five dollars a\nmonth by washing down the front steps of some big flats on Washington\nStreet, and by cleaning out vacant houses after the tenants had left.\nShe saw no one. Nobody knew her. She went about her work from dawn to\ndark, and often entire days passed when she did not hear the sound of\nher own voice. She was alone, a solitary, abandoned woman, lost in the\nlowest eddies of the great city's tide--the tide that always ebbs.\n\nWhen Trina had been discharged from the hospital after the operation on\nher fingers, she found herself alone in the world, alone with her five\nthousand dollars. The interest of this would support her, and yet allow\nher to save a little.\n\nBut for a time Trina had thought of giving up the fight altogether and\nof joining her family in the southern part of the State. But even while\nshe hesitated about this she received a long letter from her mother, an\nanswer to one she herself had written just before the amputation of her\nright-hand fingers--the last letter she would ever be able to write.\nMrs. Sieppe's letter was one long lamentation; she had her own\nmisfortunes to bewail as well as those of her daughter. The\ncarpet-cleaning and upholstery business had failed. Mr. Sieppe and\nOwgooste had left for New Zealand with a colonization company, whither\nMrs. Sieppe and the twins were to follow them as soon as the colony\nestablished itself. So far from helping Trina in her ill fortune, it\nwas she, her mother, who might some day in the near future be obliged to\nturn to Trina for aid. So Trina had given up the idea of any help from\nher family. For that matter she needed none. She still had her five\nthousand, and Uncle Oelbermann paid her the interest with a machine-like\nregularity. Now that McTeague had left her, there was one less mouth to\nfeed; and with this saving, together with the little she could earn as\nscrub-woman, Trina could almost manage to make good the amount she lost\nby being obliged to cease work upon the Noah's ark animals.\n\nLittle by little her sorrow over the loss of her precious savings\novercame the grief of McTeague's desertion of her. Her avarice had grown\nto be her one dominant passion; her love of money for the money's\nsake brooded in her heart, driving out by degrees every other natural\naffection. She grew thin and meagre; her flesh clove tight to her small\nskeleton; her small pale mouth and little uplifted chin grew to have a\ncertain feline eagerness of expression; her long, narrow eyes glistened\ncontinually, as if they caught and held the glint of metal. One day as\nshe sat in her room, the empty brass match-box and the limp chamois bag\nin her hands, she suddenly exclaimed:\n\n\"I could have forgiven him if he had only gone away and left me my\nmoney. I could have--yes, I could have forgiven him even THIS\"--she\nlooked at the stumps of her fingers. \"But now,\" her teeth closed\ntight and her eyes flashed,\n\n\"now--I'll--never--forgive--him--as-long--as--I--live.\"\n\nThe empty bag and the hollow, light match-box troubled her. Day after\nday she took them from her trunk and wept over them as other women weep\nover a dead baby's shoe. Her four hundred dollars were gone, were gone,\nwere gone. She would never see them again. She could plainly see her\nhusband spending her savings by handfuls; squandering her beautiful gold\npieces that she had been at such pains to polish with soap and ashes.\nThe thought filled her with an unspeakable anguish. She would wake at\nnight from a dream of McTeague revelling down her money, and ask of the\ndarkness, \"How much did he spend to-day? How many of the gold pieces are\nleft? Has he broken either of the two twenty-dollar pieces yet? What did\nhe spend it for?\"\n\nThe instant she was out of the hospital Trina had begun to save again,\nbut now it was with an eagerness that amounted at times to a veritable\nfrenzy. She even denied herself lights and fuel in order to put by a\nquarter or so, grudging every penny she was obliged to spend. She did\nher own washing and cooking. Finally she sold her wedding dress, that\nhad hitherto lain in the bottom of her trunk.\n\nThe day she moved from Zerkow's old house, she came suddenly upon the\ndentist's concertina under a heap of old clothes in the closet. Within\ntwenty minutes she had sold it to the dealer in second-hand furniture,\nreturning to her room with seven dollars in her pocket, happy for the\nfirst time since McTeague had left her.\n\nBut for all that the match-box and the bag refused to fill up; after\nthree weeks of the most rigid economy they contained but eighteen\ndollars and some small change. What was that compared with four hundred?\nTrina told herself that she must have her money in hand. She longed to\nsee again the heap of it upon her work-table, where she could plunge her\nhands into it, her face into it, feeling the cool, smooth metal upon her\ncheeks. At such moments she would see in her imagination her wonderful\nfive thousand dollars piled in columns, shining and gleaming somewhere\nat the bottom of Uncle Oelbermann's vault. She would look at the\npaper that Uncle Oelbermann had given her, and tell herself that it\nrepresented five thousand dollars. But in the end this ceased to satisfy\nher, she must have the money itself. She must have her four hundred\ndollars back again, there in her trunk, in her bag and her match-box,\nwhere she could touch it and see it whenever she desired.\n\nAt length she could stand it no longer, and one day presented herself\nbefore Uncle Oelbermann as he sat in his office in the wholesale toy\nstore, and told him she wanted to have four hundred dollars of her\nmoney.\n\n\"But this is very irregular, you know, Mrs. McTeague,\" said the great\nman. \"Not business-like at all.\"\n\nBut his niece's misfortunes and the sight of her poor maimed hand\nappealed to him. He opened his check-book. \"You understand, of course,\"\nhe said, \"that this will reduce the amount of your interest by just so\nmuch.\"\n\n\"I know, I know. I've thought of that,\" said Trina.\n\n\"Four hundred, did you say?\" remarked Uncle Oelbermann, taking the cap\nfrom his fountain pen.\n\n\"Yes, four hundred,\" exclaimed Trina, quickly, her eyes glistening.\n\nTrina cashed the check and returned home with the money--all in\ntwenty-dollar pieces as she had desired--in an ecstasy of delight. For\nhalf of that night she sat up playing with her money, counting it and\nrecounting it, polishing the duller pieces until they shone. Altogether\nthere were twenty twenty-dollar gold pieces.\n\n\"Oh-h, you beauties!\" murmured Trina, running her palms over them,\nfairly quivering with pleasure. \"You beauties! IS there anything\nprettier than a twenty-dollar gold piece? You dear, dear money! Oh,\ndon't I LOVE you! Mine, mine, mine--all of you mine.\"\n\nShe laid them out in a row on the ledge of the table, or arranged them\nin patterns--triangles, circles, and squares--or built them all up into\na pyramid which she afterward overthrew for the sake of hearing the\ndelicious clink of the pieces tumbling against each other. Then at last\nshe put them away in the brass match-box and chamois bag, delighted\nbeyond words that they were once more full and heavy.\n\nThen, a few days after, the thought of the money still remaining in\nUncle Oelbermann's keeping returned to her. It was hers, all hers--all\nthat four thousand six hundred. She could have as much of it or as\nlittle of it as she chose. She only had to ask. For a week Trina\nresisted, knowing very well that taking from her capital was\nproportionately reducing her monthly income. Then at last she yielded.\n\n\"Just to make it an even five hundred, anyhow,\" she told herself. That\nday she drew a hundred dollars more, in twenty-dollar gold pieces as\nbefore. From that time Trina began to draw steadily upon her capital, a\nlittle at a time. It was a passion with her, a mania, a veritable mental\ndisease; a temptation such as drunkards only know.\n\nIt would come upon her all of a sudden. While she was about her work,\nscrubbing the floor of some vacant house; or in her room, in the\nmorning, as she made her coffee on the oil stove, or when she woke in\nthe night, a brusque access of cupidity would seize upon her. Her cheeks\nflushed, her eyes glistened, her breath came short. At times she would\nleave her work just as it was, put on her old bonnet of black straw,\nthrow her shawl about her, and go straight to Uncle Oelbermann's store\nand draw against her money. Now it would be a hundred dollars, now\nsixty; now she would content herself with only twenty; and once, after a\nfortnight's abstinence, she permitted herself a positive debauch of five\nhundred. Little by little she drew her capital from Uncle Oelbermann,\nand little by little her original interest of twenty-five dollars a\nmonth dwindled.\n\nOne day she presented herself again in the office of the whole-sale toy\nstore.\n\n\"Will you let me have a check for two hundred dollars, Uncle\nOelbermann?\" she said.\n\nThe great man laid down his fountain pen and leaned back in his swivel\nchair with great deliberation.\n\n\"I don't understand, Mrs. McTeague,\" he said. \"Every week you come here\nand draw out a little of your money. I've told you that it is not at all\nregular or business-like for me to let you have it this way. And more\nthan this, it's a great inconvenience to me to give you these checks at\nunstated times. If you wish to draw out the whole amount let's have some\nunderstanding. Draw it in monthly installments of, say, five hundred\ndollars, or else,\" he added, abruptly, \"draw it all at once, now,\nto-day. I would even prefer it that way. Otherwise it's--it's annoying.\nCome, shall I draw you a check for thirty-seven hundred, and have it\nover and done with?\"\n\n\"No, no,\" cried Trina, with instinctive apprehension, refusing, she did\nnot know why. \"No, I'll leave it with you. I won't draw out any more.\"\n\nShe took her departure, but paused on the pavement outside the store,\nand stood for a moment lost in thought, her eyes beginning to glisten\nand her breath coming short. Slowly she turned about and reentered the\nstore; she came back into the office, and stood trembling at the corner\nof Uncle Oelbermann's desk. He looked up sharply. Twice Trina tried to\nget her voice, and when it did come to her, she could hardly recognize\nit. Between breaths she said:\n\n\"Yes, all right--I'll--you can give me--will you give me a check for\nthirty-seven hundred? Give me ALL of my money.\"\n\nA few hours later she entered her little room over the kindergarten,\nbolted the door with shaking fingers, and emptied a heavy canvas sack\nupon the middle of her bed. Then she opened her trunk, and taking thence\nthe brass match-box and chamois-skin bag added their contents to the\npile. Next she laid herself upon the bed and gathered the gleaming heaps\nof gold pieces to her with both arms, burying her face in them with long\nsighs of unspeakable delight.\n\nIt was a little past noon, and the day was fine and warm. The leaves\nof the huge cherry trees threw off a certain pungent aroma that entered\nthrough the open window, together with long thin shafts of golden\nsunlight. Below, in the kindergarten, the children were singing gayly\nand marching to the jangling of the piano. Trina heard nothing, saw\nnothing. She lay on her bed, her eyes closed, her face buried in a pile\nof gold that she encircled with both her arms.\n\nTrina even told herself at last that she was happy once more. McTeague\nbecame a memory--a memory that faded a little every day--dim and\nindistinct in the golden splendor of five thousand dollars.\n\n\"And yet,\" Trina would say, \"I did love Mac, loved him dearly, only a\nlittle while ago. Even when he hurt me, it only made me love him more.\nHow is it I've changed so sudden? How COULD I forget him so soon? It\nmust be because he stole my money. That is it. I couldn't forgive anyone\nthat--no, not even my MOTHER. And I never--never--will forgive him.\"\n\nWhat had become of her husband Trina did not know. She never saw any of\nthe old Polk Street people. There was no way she could have news of him,\neven if she had cared to have it. She had her money, that was the main\nthing. Her passion for it excluded every other sentiment. There it was\nin the bottom of her trunk, in the canvas sack, the chamois-skin bag,\nand the little brass match-safe. Not a day passed that Trina did not\nhave it out where she could see and touch it. One evening she had even\nspread all the gold pieces between the sheets, and had then gone to\nbed, stripping herself, and had slept all night upon the money, taking a\nstrange and ecstatic pleasure in the touch of the smooth flat pieces the\nlength of her entire body.\n\nOne night, some three months after she had come to live at the\nkindergarten, Trina was awakened by a sharp tap on the pane of the\nwindow. She sat up quickly in bed, her heart beating thickly, her eyes\nrolling wildly in the direction of her trunk. The tap was repeated.\nTrina rose and went fearfully to the window. The little court below\nwas bright with moonlight, and standing just on the edge of the shadow\nthrown by one of the cherry trees was McTeague. A bunch of half-ripe\ncherries was in his hand. He was eating them and throwing the pits at\nthe window. As he caught sight of her, he made an eager sign for her to\nraise the sash. Reluctant and wondering, Trina obeyed, and the dentist\ncame quickly forward. He was wearing a pair of blue overalls;\na navy-blue flannel shirt without a cravat; an old coat, faded,\nrain-washed, and ripped at the seams; and his woollen cap.\n\n\"Say, Trina,\" he exclaimed, his heavy bass voice pitched just above\na whisper, \"let me in, will you, huh? Say, will you? I'm regularly\nstarving, and I haven't slept in a Christian bed for two weeks.\"\n\nAt sight at him standing there in the moonlight, Trina could only think\nof him as the man who had beaten and bitten her, had deserted her and\nstolen her money, had made her suffer as she had never suffered before\nin all her life. Now that he had spent the money that he had stolen from\nher, he was whining to come back--so that he might steal more, no doubt.\nOnce in her room he could not help but smell out her five thousand\ndollars. Her indignation rose.\n\n\"No,\" she whispered back at him. \"No, I will not let you in.\"\n\n\"But listen here, Trina, I tell you I am starving, regularly----\"\n\n\"Hoh!\" interrupted Trina scornfully. \"A man can't starve with four\nhundred dollars, I guess.\"\n\n\"Well--well--I--well--\" faltered the dentist. \"Never mind now. Give me\nsomething to eat, an' let me in an' sleep. I've been sleeping in the\nPlaza for the last ten nights, and say, I--Damn it, Trina, I ain't had\nanything to eat since--\"\n\n\"Where's the four hundred dollars you robbed me of when you deserted\nme?\" returned Trina, coldly.\n\n\"Well, I've spent it,\" growled the dentist. \"But you CAN'T see me\nstarve, Trina, no matter what's happened. Give me a little money, then.\"\n\n\"I'll see you starve before you get any more of MY money.\"\n\nThe dentist stepped back a pace and stared up at her wonder-stricken.\nHis face was lean and pinched. Never had the jaw bone looked so\nenormous, nor the square-cut head so huge. The moonlight made deep black\nshadows in the shrunken cheeks.\n\n\"Huh?\" asked the dentist, puzzled. \"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I won't give you any money--never again--not a cent.\"\n\n\"But do you know that I'm hungry?\"\n\n\"Well, I've been hungry myself. Besides, I DON'T believe you.\"\n\n\"Trina, I ain't had a thing to eat since yesterday morning; that's God's\ntruth. Even if I did get off with your money, you CAN'T see me starve,\ncan you? You can't see me walk the streets all night because I ain't got\na place to sleep. Will you let me in? Say, will you? Huh?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Well, will you give me some money then--just a little? Give me a\ndollar. Give me half a dol--Say, give me a DIME, an' I can get a cup of\ncoffee.\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\nThe dentist paused and looked at her with curious intentness,\nbewildered, nonplussed.\n\n\"Say, you--you must be crazy, Trina. I--I--wouldn't let a DOG go\nhungry.\"\n\n\"Not even if he'd bitten you, perhaps.\"\n\nThe dentist stared again.\n\nThere was another pause. McTeague looked up at her in silence, a\nmean and vicious twinkle coming into his small eyes. He uttered a low\nexclamation, and then checked himself.\n\n\"Well, look here, for the last time. I'm starving. I've got nowhere to\nsleep. Will you give me some money, or something to eat? Will you let me\nin?\"\n\n\"No--no--no.\"\n\nTrina could fancy she almost saw the brassy glint in her husband's eyes.\nHe raised one enormous lean fist. Then he growled:\n\n\"If I had hold of you for a minute, by God, I'd make you dance. An' I\nwill yet, I will yet. Don't you be afraid of that.\"\n\nHe turned about, the moonlight showing like a layer of snow upon his\nmassive shoulders. Trina watched him as he passed under the shadow of\nthe cherry trees and crossed the little court. She heard his great feet\ngrinding on the board flooring. He disappeared.\n\nMiser though she was, Trina was only human, and the echo of the\ndentist's heavy feet had not died away before she began to be sorry for\nwhat she had done. She stood by the open window in her nightgown, her\nfinger upon her lips.\n\n\"He did looked pinched,\" she said half aloud. \"Maybe he WAS hungry. I\nought to have given him something. I wish I had, I WISH I had. Oh,\" she\ncried, suddenly, with a frightened gesture of both hands, \"what have I\ncome to be that I would see Mac--my husband--that I would see him starve\nrather than give him money? No, no. It's too dreadful. I WILL give him\nsome. I'll send it to him to-morrow. Where?--well, he'll come back.\"\nShe leaned from the window and called as loudly as she dared, \"Mac, oh,\nMac.\" There was no answer.\n\nWhen McTeague had told Trina he had been without food for nearly two\ndays he was speaking the truth. The week before he had spent the last of\nthe four hundred dollars in the bar of a sailor's lodging-house near\nthe water front, and since that time had lived a veritable hand-to-mouth\nexistence.\n\nHe had spent her money here and there about the city in royal fashion,\nabsolutely reckless of the morrow, feasting and drinking for the most\npart with companions he picked up heaven knows where, acquaintances of\ntwenty-four hours, whose names he forgot in two days. Then suddenly he\nfound himself at the end of his money. He no longer had any friends.\nHunger rode him and rowelled him. He was no longer well fed,\ncomfortable. There was no longer a warm place for him to sleep. He went\nback to Polk Street in the evening, walking on the dark side of the\nstreet, lurking in the shadows, ashamed to have any of his old-time\nfriends see him. He entered Zerkow's old house and knocked at the door\nof the room Trina and he had occupied. It was empty.\n\nNext day he went to Uncle Oelbermann's store and asked news of Trina.\nTrina had not told Uncle Oelbermann of McTeague's brutalities, giving\nhim other reasons to explain the loss of her fingers; neither had she\ntold him of her husband's robbery. So when the dentist had asked where\nTrina could be found, Uncle Oelbermann, believing that McTeague was\nseeking a reconciliation, had told him without hesitation, and, he\nadded:\n\n\"She was in here only yesterday and drew out the balance of her money.\nShe's been drawing against her money for the last month or so. She's got\nit all now, I guess.\"\n\n\"Ah, she's got it all.\"\n\nThe dentist went away from his bootless visit to his wife shaking with\nrage, hating her with all the strength of a crude and primitive nature.\nHe clenched his fists till his knuckles whitened, his teeth ground\nfuriously upon one another.\n\n\"Ah, if I had hold of you once, I'd make you dance. She had five\nthousand dollars in that room, while I stood there, not twenty feet\naway, and told her I was starving, and she wouldn't give me a dime to\nget a cup of coffee with; not a dime to get a cup of coffee. Oh, if I\nonce get my hands on you!\" His wrath strangled him. He clutched at the\ndarkness in front of him, his breath fairly whistling between his teeth.\n\nThat night he walked the streets until the morning, wondering what now\nhe was to do to fight the wolf away. The morning of the next day towards\nten o'clock he was on Kearney Street, still walking, still tramping the\nstreets, since there was nothing else for him to do. By and by he\npaused on a corner near a music store, finding a momentary amusement in\nwatching two or three men loading a piano upon a dray. Already half\nits weight was supported by the dray's backboard. One of the men, a\nbig mulatto, almost hidden under the mass of glistening rosewood, was\nguiding its course, while the other two heaved and tugged in the rear.\nSomething in the street frightened the horses and they shied abruptly.\nThe end of the piano was twitched sharply from the backboard. There was\na cry, the mulatto staggered and fell with the falling piano, and its\nweight dropped squarely upon his thigh, which broke with a resounding\ncrack.\n\nAn hour later McTeague had found his job. The music store engaged him as\nhandler at six dollars a week. McTeague's enormous strength, useless all\nhis life, stood him in good stead at last.\n\nHe slept in a tiny back room opening from the storeroom of the music\nstore. He was in some sense a watchman as well as handler, and went the\nrounds of the store twice every night. His room was a box of a place\nthat reeked with odors of stale tobacco smoke. The former occupant had\npapered the walls with newspapers and had pasted up figures cut out\nfrom the posters of some Kiralfy ballet, very gaudy. By the one window,\nchittering all day in its little gilt prison, hung the canary bird, a\ntiny atom of life that McTeague still clung to with a strange obstinacy.\n\nMcTeague drank a good deal of whiskey in these days, but the only effect\nit had upon him was to increase the viciousness and bad temper that had\ndeveloped in him since the beginning of his misfortunes. He terrorized\nhis fellow-handlers, powerful men though they were. For a gruff word,\nfor an awkward movement in lading the pianos, for a surly look or a\nmuttered oath, the dentist's elbow would crook and his hand contract to\na mallet-like fist. As often as not the blow followed, colossal in its\nforce, swift as the leap of the piston from its cylinder.\n\nHis hatred of Trina increased from day to day. He'd make her dance yet.\nWait only till he got his hands upon her. She'd let him starve, would\nshe? She'd turn him out of doors while she hid her five thousand dollars\nin the bottom of her trunk. Aha, he would see about that some day. She\ncouldn't make small of him. Ah, no. She'd dance all right--all right.\nMcTeague was not an imaginative man by nature, but he would lie awake\nnights, his clumsy wits galloping and frisking under the lash of the\nalcohol, and fancy himself thrashing his wife, till a sudden frenzy of\nrage would overcome him, and he would shake all over, rolling upon the\nbed and biting the mattress.\n\nOn a certain day, about a week after Christmas of that year, McTeague\nwas on one of the top floors of the music store, where the second-hand\ninstruments were kept, helping to move about and rearrange some old\npianos. As he passed by one of the counters he paused abruptly, his eye\ncaught by an object that was strangely familiar.\n\n\"Say,\" he inquired, addressing the clerk in charge, \"say, where'd this\ncome from?\"\n\n\"Why, let's see. We got that from a second-hand store up on Polk Street,\nI guess. It's a fairly good machine; a little tinkering with the stops\nand a bit of shellac, and we'll make it about's good as new. Good\ntone. See.\" And the clerk drew a long, sonorous wail from the depths of\nMcTeague's old concertina.\n\n\"Well, it's mine,\" growled the dentist.\n\nThe other laughed. \"It's yours for eleven dollars.\"\n\n\"It's mine,\" persisted McTeague. \"I want it.\"\n\n\"Go 'long with you, Mac. What do you mean?\"\n\n\"I mean that it's mine, that's what I mean. You got no right to it.\nIt was STOLEN from me, that's what I mean,\" he added, a sullen anger\nflaming up in his little eyes.\n\nThe clerk raised a shoulder and put the concertina on an upper shelf.\n\n\"You talk to the boss about that; t'ain't none of my affair. If you want\nto buy it, it's eleven dollars.\"\n\nThe dentist had been paid off the day before and had four dollars in his\nwallet at the moment. He gave the money to the clerk.\n\n\"Here, there's part of the money. You--you put that concertina aside\nfor me, an' I'll give you the rest in a week or so--I'll give it to you\ntomorrow,\" he exclaimed, struck with a sudden idea.\n\nMcTeague had sadly missed his concertina. Sunday afternoons when there\nwas no work to be done, he was accustomed to lie flat on his back on his\nspringless bed in the little room in the rear of the music store,\nhis coat and shoes off, reading the paper, drinking steam beer from\na pitcher, and smoking his pipe. But he could no longer play his six\nlugubrious airs upon his concertina, and it was a deprivation. He often\nwondered where it was gone. It had been lost, no doubt, in the general\nwreck of his fortunes. Once, even, the dentist had taken a concertina\nfrom the lot kept by the music store. It was a Sunday and no one was\nabout. But he found he could not play upon it. The stops were arranged\nupon a system he did not understand.\n\nNow his own concertina was come back to him. He would buy it back.\nHe had given the clerk four dollars. He knew where he would get the\nremaining seven.\n\nThe clerk had told him the concertina had been sold on Polk Street to\nthe second-hand store there. Trina had sold it. McTeague knew it. Trina\nhad sold his concertina--had stolen it and sold it--his concertina,\nhis beloved concertina, that he had had all his life. Why, barring\nthe canary, there was not one of all his belongings that McTeague had\ncherished more dearly. His steel engraving of \"Lorenzo de' Medici\nand his Court\" might be lost, his stone pug dog might go, but his\nconcertina!\n\n\"And she sold it--stole it from me and sold it. Just because I happened\nto forget to take it along with me. Well, we'll just see about that.\nYou'll give me the money to buy it back, or----\"\n\nHis rage loomed big within him. His hatred of Trina came back upon him\nlike a returning surge. He saw her small, prim mouth, her narrow blue\neyes, her black mane of hair, and up-tilted chin, and hated her the more\nbecause of them. Aha, he'd show her; he'd make her dance. He'd get that\nseven dollars from her, or he'd know the reason why. He went through\nhis work that day, heaving and hauling at the ponderous pianos, handling\nthem with the ease of a lifting crane, impatient for the coming of\nevening, when he could be left to his own devices. As often as he had a\nmoment to spare he went down the street to the nearest saloon and drank\na pony of whiskey. Now and then as he fought and struggled with the vast\nmasses of ebony, rosewood, and mahogany on the upper floor of the music\nstore, raging and chafing at their inertness and unwillingness, while\nthe whiskey pirouetted in his brain, he would mutter to himself:\n\n\"An' I got to do this. I got to work like a dray horse while she sits at\nhome by her stove and counts her money--and sells my concertina.\"\n\nSix o'clock came. Instead of supper, McTeague drank some more whiskey,\nfive ponies in rapid succession. After supper he was obliged to go out\nwith the dray to deliver a concert grand at the Odd Fellows' Hall, where\na piano \"recital\" was to take place.\n\n\"Ain't you coming back with us?\" asked one of the handlers as he climbed\nupon the driver's seat after the piano had been put in place.\n\n\"No, no,\" returned the dentist; \"I got something else to do.\" The\nbrilliant lights of a saloon near the City Hall caught his eye. He\ndecided he would have another drink of whiskey. It was about eight\no'clock.\n\nThe following day was to be a fete day at the kindergarten, the\nChristmas and New Year festivals combined. All that afternoon the little\ntwo-story building on Pacific Street had been filled with a number of\ngrand ladies of the Kindergarten Board, who were hanging up ropes of\nevergreen and sprays of holly, and arranging a great Christmas tree that\nstood in the centre of the ring in the schoolroom. The whole place was\npervaded with a pungent, piney odor. Trina had been very busy since the\nearly morning, coming and going at everybody's call, now running down\nthe street after another tack-hammer or a fresh supply of cranberries,\nnow tying together the ropes of evergreen and passing them up to one of\nthe grand ladies as she carefully balanced herself on a step-ladder. By\nevening everything was in place. As the last grand lady left the school,\nshe gave Trina an extra dollar for her work, and said:\n\n\"Now, if you'll just tidy up here, Mrs. McTeague, I think that will\nbe all. Sweep up the pine needles here--you see they are all over the\nfloor--and look through all the rooms, and tidy up generally. Good\nnight--and a Happy New Year,\" she cried pleasantly as she went out.\n\nTrina put the dollar away in her trunk before she did anything else and\ncooked herself a bit of supper. Then she came downstairs again.\n\nThe kindergarten was not large. On the lower floor were but two rooms,\nthe main schoolroom and another room, a cloakroom, very small, where the\nchildren hung their hats and coats. This cloakroom opened off the back\nof the main schoolroom. Trina cast a critical glance into both of these\nrooms. There had been a great deal of going and coming in them during\nthe day, and she decided that the first thing to do would be to scrub\nthe floors. She went up again to her room overhead and heated some water\nover her oil stove; then, re-descending, set to work vigorously.\n\nBy nine o'clock she had almost finished with the schoolroom. She was\ndown on her hands and knees in the midst of a steaming muck of soapy\nwater. On her feet were a pair of man's shoes fastened with buckles;\na dirty cotton gown, damp with the water, clung about her shapeless,\nstunted figure. From time to time she sat back on her heels to ease the\nstrain of her position, and with one smoking hand, white and parboiled\nwith the hot water, brushed her hair, already streaked with gray, out of\nher weazened, pale face and the corners of her mouth.\n\nIt was very quiet. A gas-jet without a globe lit up the place with a\ncrude, raw light. The cat who lived on the premises, preferring to be\ndirty rather than to be wet, had got into the coal scuttle, and over its\nrim watched her sleepily with a long, complacent purr.\n\nAll at once he stopped purring, leaving an abrupt silence in the air\nlike the sudden shutting off of a stream of water, while his eyes grew\nwide, two lambent disks of yellow in the heap of black fur.\n\n\"Who is there?\" cried Trina, sitting back on her heels. In the stillness\nthat succeeded, the water dripped from her hands with the steady tick of\na clock. Then a brutal fist swung open the street door of the schoolroom\nand McTeague came in. He was drunk; not with that drunkenness which is\nstupid, maudlin, wavering on its feet, but with that which is alert,\nunnaturally intelligent, vicious, perfectly steady, deadly wicked. Trina\nonly had to look once at him, and in an instant, with some strange sixth\nsense, born of the occasion, knew what she had to expect.\n\nShe jumped up and ran from him into the little cloakroom. She locked and\nbolted the door after her, and leaned her weight against it, panting and\ntrembling, every nerve shrinking and quivering with the fear of him.\n\nMcTeague put his hand on the knob of the door outside and opened it,\ntearing off the lock and bolt guard, and sending her staggering across\nthe room.\n\n\"Mac,\" she cried to him, as he came in, speaking with horrid rapidity,\ncringing and holding out her hands, \"Mac, listen. Wait a minute--look\nhere--listen here. It wasn't my fault. I'll give you some money. You can\ncome back. I'll do ANYTHING you want. Won't you just LISTEN to me? Oh,\ndon't! I'll scream. I can't help it, you know. The people will hear.\"\n\nMcTeague came towards her slowly, his immense feet dragging and grinding\non the floor; his enormous fists, hard as wooden mallets, swinging at\nhis sides. Trina backed from him to the corner of the room, cowering\nbefore him, holding her elbow crooked in front of her face, watching him\nwith fearful intentness, ready to dodge.\n\n\"I want that money,\" he said, pausing in front of her.\n\n\"What money?\" cried Trina.\n\n\"I want that money. You got it--that five thousand dollars. I want every\nnickel of it! You understand?\"\n\n\"I haven't it. It isn't here. Uncle Oelbermann's got it.\"\n\n\"That's a lie. He told me that you came and got it. You've had it long\nenough; now I want it. Do you hear?\"\n\n\"Mac, I can't give you that money. I--I WON'T give it to you,\" Trina\ncried, with sudden resolution.\n\n\"Yes, you will. You'll give me every nickel of it.\"\n\n\"No, NO.\"\n\n\"You ain't going to make small of me this time. Give me that money.\"\n\n\"NO.\"\n\n\"For the last time, will you give me that money?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"You won't, huh? You won't give me it? For the last time.\"\n\n\"No, NO.\"\n\nUsually the dentist was slow in his movements, but now the alcohol had\nawakened in him an ape-like agility. He kept his small eyes upon her,\nand all at once sent his fist into the middle of her face with the\nsuddenness of a relaxed spring.\n\nBeside herself with terror, Trina turned and fought him back; fought for\nher miserable life with the exasperation and strength of a harassed cat;\nand with such energy and such wild, unnatural force, that even McTeague\nfor the moment drew back from her. But her resistance was the one thing\nto drive him to the top of his fury. He came back at her again, his eyes\ndrawn to two fine twinkling points, and his enormous fists, clenched\ntill the knuckles whitened, raised in the air.\n\nThen it became abominable.\n\nIn the schoolroom outside, behind the coal scuttle, the cat listened to\nthe sounds of stamping and struggling and the muffled noise of blows,\nwildly terrified, his eyes bulging like brass knobs. At last the sounds\nstopped on a sudden; he heard nothing more. Then McTeague came out,\nclosing the door. The cat followed him with distended eyes as he crossed\nthe room and disappeared through the street door.\n\nThe dentist paused for a moment on the sidewalk, looking carefully up\nand down the street. It was deserted and quiet. He turned sharply to the\nright and went down a narrow passage that led into the little court yard\nbehind the school. A candle was burning in Trina's room. He went up by\nthe outside stairway and entered.\n\nThe trunk stood locked in one corner of the room. The dentist took the\nlid-lifter from the little oil stove, put it underneath the lock-clasp\nand wrenched it open. Groping beneath a pile of dresses he found the\nchamois-skin bag, the little brass match-box, and, at the very bottom,\ncarefully thrust into one corner, the canvas sack crammed to the mouth\nwith twenty-dollar gold pieces. He emptied the chamois-skin bag and the\nmatchbox into the pockets of his trousers. But the canvas sack was too\nbulky to hide about his clothes. \"I guess I'll just naturally have to\ncarry YOU,\" he muttered. He blew out the candle, closed the door, and\ngained the street again.\n\nThe dentist crossed the city, going back to the music store. It was a\nlittle after eleven o'clock. The night was moonless, filled with a gray\nblur of faint light that seemed to come from all quarters of the horizon\nat once. From time to time there were sudden explosions of a southeast\nwind at the street corners. McTeague went on, slanting his head against\nthe gusts, to keep his cap from blowing off, carrying the sack close to\nhis side. Once he looked critically at the sky.\n\n\"I bet it'll rain to-morrow,\" he muttered, \"if this wind works round to\nthe south.\"\n\nOnce in his little den behind the music store, he washed his hands and\nforearms, and put on his working clothes, blue overalls and a\njumper, over cheap trousers and vest. Then he got together his small\nbelongings--an old campaign hat, a pair of boots, a tin of tobacco,\nand a pinchbeck bracelet which he had found one Sunday in the Park, and\nwhich he believed to be valuable. He stripped his blanket from his bed\nand rolled up in it all these objects, together with the canvas sack,\nfastening the roll with a half hitch such as miners use, the instincts\nof the old-time car-boy coming back to him in his present confusion\nof mind. He changed his pipe and his knife--a huge jackknife with a\nyellowed bone handle--to the pockets of his overalls.\n\nThen at last he stood with his hand on the door, holding up the lamp\nbefore blowing it out, looking about to make sure he was ready to go.\nThe wavering light woke his canary. It stirred and began to chitter\nfeebly, very sleepy and cross at being awakened. McTeague started,\nstaring at it, and reflecting. He believed that it would be a long\ntime before anyone came into that room again. The canary would be days\nwithout food; it was likely it would starve, would die there, hour by\nhour, in its little gilt prison. McTeague resolved to take it with him.\nHe took down the cage, touching it gently with his enormous hands, and\ntied a couple of sacks about it to shelter the little bird from the\nsharp night wind.\n\nThen he went out, locking all the doors behind him, and turned toward\nthe ferry slips. The boats had ceased running hours ago, but he told\nhimself that by waiting till four o'clock he could get across the bay on\nthe tug that took over the morning papers.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nTrina lay unconscious, just as she had fallen under the last of\nMcTeague's blows, her body twitching with an occasional hiccough that\nstirred the pool of blood in which she lay face downward. Towards\nmorning she died with a rapid series of hiccoughs that sounded like a\npiece of clockwork running down.\n\nThe thing had been done in the cloakroom where the kindergarten children\nhung their hats and coats. There was no other entrance except by going\nthrough the main schoolroom. McTeague going out had shut the door of\nthe cloakroom, but had left the street door open; so when the children\narrived in the morning, they entered as usual.\n\nAbout half-past eight, two or three five-year-olds, one a little colored\ngirl, came into the schoolroom of the kindergarten with a great chatter\nof voices, going across to the cloakroom to hang up their hats and coats\nas they had been taught.\n\nHalf way across the room one of them stopped and put her small nose\nin the air, crying, \"Um-o-o, what a funnee smell!\" The others began to\nsniff the air as well, and one, the daughter of a butcher, exclaimed,\n\"'Tsmells like my pa's shop,\" adding in the next breath, \"Look, what's\nthe matter with the kittee?\"\n\nIn fact, the cat was acting strangely. He lay quite flat on the floor,\nhis nose pressed close to the crevice under the door of the little\ncloakroom, winding his tail slowly back and forth, excited, very eager.\nAt times he would draw back and make a strange little clacking noise\ndown in his throat.\n\n\"Ain't he funnee?\" said the little girl again. The cat slunk swiftly\naway as the children came up. Then the tallest of the little girls swung\nthe door of the little cloakroom wide open and they all ran in.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 20\n\n\nThe day was very hot, and the silence of high noon lay close and thick\nbetween the steep slopes of the ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3ns like an invisible, muffling\nfluid. At intervals the drone of an insect bored the air and trailed\nslowly to silence again. Everywhere were pungent, aromatic smells.\nThe vast, moveless heat seemed to distil countless odors from the\nbrush--odors of warm sap, of pine needles, and of tar-weed, and above\nall the medicinal odor of witch hazel. As far as one could look,\nuncounted multitudes of trees and manzanita bushes were quietly and\nmotionlessly growing, growing, growing. A tremendous, immeasurable Life\npushed steadily heavenward without a sound, without a motion. At turns\nof the road, on the higher points, ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3ns disclosed themselves far\naway, gigantic grooves in the landscape, deep blue in the distance,\nopening one into another, ocean-deep, silent, huge, and suggestive of\ncolossal primeval forces held in reserve. At their bottoms they were\nsolid, massive; on their crests they broke delicately into fine serrated\nedges where the pines and redwoods outlined their million of tops\nagainst the high white horizon. Here and there the mountains lifted\nthemselves out of the narrow river beds in groups like giant lions\nrearing their heads after drinking. The entire region was untamed. In\nsome places east of the Mississippi nature is cosey, intimate,\nsmall, and homelike, like a good-natured housewife. In Placer County,\nCalifornia, she is a vast, unconquered brute of the Pliocene epoch,\nsavage, sullen, and magnificently indifferent to man.\n\nBut there were men in these mountains, like lice on mammoths' hides,\nfighting them stubbornly, now with hydraulic \"monitors,\" now with drill\nand dynamite, boring into the vitals of them, or tearing away great\nyellow gravelly scars in the flanks of them, sucking their blood,\nextracting gold.\n\nHere and there at long distances upon the ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3n sides rose the headgear\nof a mine, surrounded with its few unpainted houses, and topped by its\nnever-failing feather of black smoke. On near approach one heard\nthe prolonged thunder of the stamp-mill, the crusher, the insatiable\nmonster, gnashing the rocks to powder with its long iron teeth, vomiting\nthem out again in a thin stream of wet gray mud. Its enormous maw, fed\nnight and day with the car-boys' loads, gorged itself with gravel, and\nspat out the gold, grinding the rocks between its jaws, glutted, as it\nwere, with the very entrails of the earth, and growling over its endless\nmeal, like some savage animal, some legendary dragon, some fabulous\nbeast, symbol of inordinate and monstrous gluttony.\n\nMcTeague had left the Overland train at Colfax, and the same afternoon\nhad ridden some eight miles across the mountains in the stage that\nconnects Colfax with Iowa Hill. Iowa Hill was a small one-street town,\nthe headquarters of the mines of the district. Originally it had been\nbuilt upon the summit of a mountain, but the sides of this mountain have\nlong since been \"hydrau-licked\" away, so that the town now clings to a\nmere back bone, and the rear windows of the houses on both sides of the\nstreet look down over sheer precipices, into vast pits hundreds of feet\ndeep.\n\nThe dentist stayed over night at the Hill, and the next morning started\noff on foot farther into the mountains. He still wore his blue overalls\nand jumper; his woollen cap was pulled down over his eye; on his feet\nwere hob-nailed boots he had bought at the store in Colfax; his blanket\nroll was over his back; in his left hand swung the bird cage wrapped in\nsacks.\n\nJust outside the town he paused, as if suddenly remembering something.\n\n\"There ought to be a trail just off the road here,\" he muttered. \"There\nused to be a trail--a short cut.\"\n\nThe next instant, without moving from his position, he saw where it\nopened just before him. His instinct had halted him at the exact spot.\nThe trail zigzagged down the abrupt descent of the ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3n, debouching\ninto a gravelly river bed.\n\n\"Indian River,\" muttered the dentist. \"I remember--I remember. I ought\nto hear the Morning Star's stamps from here.\" He cocked his head. A low,\nsustained roar, like a distant cataract, came to his ears from across\nthe river. \"That's right,\" he said, contentedly. He crossed the river\nand regained the road beyond. The slope rose under his feet; a little\nfarther on he passed the Morning Star mine, smoking and thundering.\nMcTeague pushed steadily on. The road rose with the rise of the\nmountain, turned at a sharp angle where a great live-oak grew, and held\nlevel for nearly a quarter of a mile. Twice again the dentist left the\nroad and took to the trail that cut through deserted hydraulic pits. He\nknew exactly where to look for these trails; not once did his instinct\ndeceive him. He recognized familiar points at once. Here was Cold\nca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3n, where invariably, winter and summer, a chilly wind was blowing;\nhere was where the road to Spencer's branched off; here was Bussy's\nold place, where at one time there were so many dogs; here was Delmue's\ncabin, where unlicensed whiskey used to be sold; here was the plank\nbridge with its one rotten board; and here the flat overgrown with\nmanzanita, where he once had shot three quail.\n\nAt noon, after he had been tramping for some two hours, he halted at a\npoint where the road dipped suddenly. A little to the right of him, and\nflanking the road, an enormous yellow gravel-pit like an emptied lake\ngaped to heaven. Farther on, in the distance, a ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3n zigzagged toward\nthe horizon, rugged with pine-clad mountain crests. Nearer at hand, and\ndirectly in the line of the road, was an irregular cluster of unpainted\ncabins. A dull, prolonged roar vibrated in the air. McTeague nodded his\nhead as if satisfied.\n\n\"That's the place,\" he muttered.\n\nHe reshouldered his blanket roll and descended the road. At last he\nhalted again. He stood before a low one-story building, differing from\nthe others in that it was painted. A verandah, shut in with mosquito\nnetting, surrounded it. McTeague dropped his blanket roll on a lumber\npile outside, and came up and knocked at the open door. Some one called\nto him to come in.\n\nMcTeague entered, rolling his eyes about him, noting the changes that\nhad been made since he had last seen this place. A partition had been\nknocked down, making one big room out of the two former small ones. A\ncounter and railing stood inside the door. There was a telephone on the\nwall. In one corner he also observed a stack of surveyor's instruments;\na big drawing-board straddled on spindle legs across one end of the\nroom, a mechanical drawing of some kind, no doubt the plan of the\nmine, unrolled upon it; a chromo representing a couple of peasants in a\nploughed field (Millet's \"Angelus\") was nailed unframed upon the wall,\nand hanging from the same wire nail that secured one of its corners in\nplace was a bullion bag and a cartridge belt with a loaded revolver in\nthe pouch.\n\nThe dentist approached the counter and leaned his elbows upon it. Three\nmen were in the room--a tall, lean young man, with a thick head of hair\nsurprisingly gray, who was playing with a half-grown great Dane puppy;\nanother fellow about as young, but with a jaw almost as salient as\nMcTeague's, stood at the letter-press taking a copy of a letter; a third\nman, a little older than the other two, was pottering over a transit.\nThis latter was massively built, and wore overalls and low boots\nstreaked and stained and spotted in every direction with gray mud. The\ndentist looked slowly from one to the other; then at length, \"Is the\nforeman about?\" he asked.\n\nThe man in the muddy overalls came forward.\n\n\"What you want?\"\n\nHe spoke with a strong German accent.\n\nThe old invariable formula came back to McTeague on the instant.\n\n\"What's the show for a job?\"\n\nAt once the German foreman became preoccupied, looking aimlessly out of\nthe window. There was a silence.\n\n\"You hev been miner alretty?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"Know how to hendle pick'n shov'le?\"\n\n\"Yes, I know.\"\n\nThe other seemed unsatisfied. \"Are you a 'cousin Jack'?\"\n\nThe dentist grinned. This prejudice against Cornishmen he remembered\ntoo.\n\n\"No. American.\"\n\n\"How long sence you mine?\"\n\n\"Oh, year or two.\"\n\n\"Show your hends.\" McTeague exhibited his hard, callused palms.\n\n\"When ken you go to work? I want a chuck-tender on der night-shift.\"\n\n\"I can tend a chuck. I'll go on to-night.\"\n\n\"What's your name?\"\n\nThe dentist started. He had forgotten to be prepared for this.\n\n\"Huh? What?\"\n\n\"What's the name?\"\n\nMcTeague's eye was caught by a railroad calendar hanging over the desk.\nThere was no time to think.\n\n\"Burlington,\" he said, loudly.\n\nThe German took a card from a file and wrote it down.\n\n\"Give dis card to der boarding-boss, down at der boarding-haus, den gome\nfind me bei der mill at sex o'clock, und I set you to work.\"\n\nStraight as a homing pigeon, and following a blind and unreasoned\ninstinct, McTeague had returned to the Big Dipper mine. Within a week's\ntime it seemed to him as though he had never been away. He picked up his\nlife again exactly where he had left it the day when his mother had sent\nhim away with the travelling dentist, the charlatan who had set up his\ntent by the bunk house. The house McTeague had once lived in was still\nthere, occupied by one of the shift bosses and his family. The dentist\npassed it on his way to and from the mine.\n\nHe himself slept in the bunk house with some thirty others of his shift.\nAt half-past five in the evening the cook at the boarding-house sounded\na prolonged alarm upon a crowbar bent in the form of a triangle, that\nhung upon the porch of the boarding-house. McTeague rose and dressed,\nand with his shift had supper. Their lunch-pails were distributed to\nthem. Then he made his way to the tunnel mouth, climbed into a car in\nthe waiting ore train, and was hauled into the mine.\n\nOnce inside, the hot evening air turned to a cool dampness, and the\nforest odors gave place to the smell of stale dynamite smoke, suggestive\nof burning rubber. A cloud of steam came from McTeague's mouth;\nunderneath, the water swashed and rippled around the car-wheels, while\nthe light from the miner's candlesticks threw wavering blurs of pale\nyellow over the gray rotting quartz of the roof and walls. Occasionally\nMcTeague bent down his head to avoid the lagging of the roof or the\nprojections of an overhanging shute. From car to car all along the line\nthe miners called to one another as the train trundled along, joshing\nand laughing.\n\nA mile from the entrance the train reached the breast where McTeague's\ngang worked. The men clambered from the cars and took up the labor\nwhere the day shift had left it, burrowing their way steadily through a\nprimeval river bed.\n\nThe candlesticks thrust into the crevices of the gravel strata lit up\nfaintly the half dozen moving figures befouled with sweat and with\nwet gray mould. The picks struck into the loose gravel with a yielding\nshock. The long-handled shovels clinked amidst the piles of bowlders and\nscraped dully in the heaps of rotten quartz. The Burly drill boring for\nblasts broke out from time to time in an irregular chug-chug, chug-chug,\nwhile the engine that pumped the water from the mine coughed and\nstrangled at short intervals.\n\nMcTeague tended the chuck. In a way he was the assistant of the man who\nworked the Burly. It was his duty to replace the drills in the Burly,\nputting in longer ones as the hole got deeper and deeper. From time\nto time he rapped the drill with a pole-pick when it stuck fast or\nfitchered.\n\nOnce it even occurred to him that there was a resemblance between his\npresent work and the profession he had been forced to abandon. In the\nBurly drill he saw a queer counterpart of his old-time dental engine;\nand what were the drills and chucks but enormous hoe excavators, hard\nbits, and burrs? It was the same work he had so often performed in his\n\"Parlors,\" only magnified, made monstrous, distorted, and grotesqued,\nthe caricature of dentistry.\n\nHe passed his nights thus in the midst of the play of crude and simple\nforces--the powerful attacks of the Burly drills; the great exertions\nof bared, bent backs overlaid with muscle; the brusque, resistless\nexpansion of dynamite; and the silent, vast, Titanic force, mysterious\nand slow, that cracked the timbers supporting the roof of the tunnel,\nand that gradually flattened the lagging till it was thin as paper.\n\nThe life pleased the dentist beyond words. The still, colossal mountains\ntook him back again like a returning prodigal, and vaguely, without\nknowing why, he yielded to their influence--their immensity, their\nenormous power, crude and blind, reflecting themselves in his own\nnature, huge, strong, brutal in its simplicity. And this, though he only\nsaw the mountains at night. They appeared far different then than in the\ndaytime. At twelve o'clock he came out of the mine and lunched on the\ncontents of his dinner-pail, sitting upon the embankment of the track,\neating with both hands, and looking around him with a steady ox-like\ngaze. The mountains rose sheer from every side, heaving their gigantic\ncrests far up into the night, the black peaks crowding together, and\nlooking now less like beasts than like a company of cowled giants. In\nthe daytime they were silent; but at night they seemed to stir and rouse\nthemselves. Occasionally the stamp-mill stopped, its thunder ceasing\nabruptly. Then one could hear the noises that the mountains made in\ntheir living. From the ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3n, from the crowding crests, from the whole\nimmense landscape, there rose a steady and prolonged sound, coming\nfrom all sides at once. It was that incessant and muffled roar which\ndisengages itself from all vast bodies, from oceans, from cities, from\nforests, from sleeping armies, and which is like the breathing of an\ninfinitely great monster, alive, palpitating.\n\nMcTeague returned to his work. At six in the morning his shift was taken\noff, and he went out of the mine and back to the bunk house. All day\nlong he slept, flung at length upon the strong-smelling blankets--slept\nthe dreamless sleep of exhaustion, crushed and overpowered with the\nwork, flat and prone upon his belly, till again in the evening the cook\nsounded the alarm upon the crowbar bent into a triangle.\n\nEvery alternate week the shifts were changed. The second week McTeague's\nshift worked in the daytime and slept at night. Wednesday night of this\nsecond week the dentist woke suddenly. He sat up in his bed in the bunk\nhouse, looking about him from side to side; an alarm clock hanging on\nthe wall, over a lantern, marked half-past three.\n\n\"What was it?\" muttered the dentist. \"I wonder what it was.\" The rest of\nthe shift were sleeping soundly, filling the room with the rasping sound\nof snoring. Everything was in its accustomed place; nothing stirred. But\nfor all that McTeague got up and lit his miner's candlestick and went\ncarefully about the room, throwing the light into the dark corners,\npeering under all the beds, including his own. Then he went to the door\nand stepped outside. The night was warm and still; the moon, very low,\nand canted on her side like a galleon foundering. The camp was very\nquiet; nobody was in sight. \"I wonder what it was,\" muttered the\ndentist. \"There was something--why did I wake up? Huh?\" He made a\ncircuit about the bunk house, unusually alert, his small eyes twinkling\nrapidly, seeing everything. All was quiet. An old dog who invariably\nslept on the steps of the bunk house had not even wakened. McTeague went\nback to bed, but did not sleep.\n\n\"There was SOMETHING,\" he muttered, looking in a puzzled way at his\ncanary in the cage that hung from the wall at his bedside; \"something.\nWhat was it? There is something NOW. There it is again--the same thing.\"\nHe sat up in bed with eyes and ears strained. \"What is it? I don'\nknow what it is. I don' hear anything, an' I don' see anything. I feel\nsomething--right now; feel it now. I wonder--I don' know--I don' know.\"\n\nOnce more he got up, and this time dressed himself. He made a complete\ntour of the camp, looking and listening, for what he did not know.\nHe even went to the outskirts of the camp and for nearly half an hour\nwatched the road that led into the camp from the direction of Iowa Hill.\nHe saw nothing; not even a rabbit stirred. He went to bed.\n\nBut from this time on there was a change. The dentist grew restless,\nuneasy. Suspicion of something, he could not say what, annoyed him\nincessantly. He went wide around sharp corners. At every moment he\nlooked sharply over his shoulder. He even went to bed with his clothes\nand cap on, and at every hour during the night would get up and prowl\nabout the bunk house, one ear turned down the wind, his eyes gimleting\nthe darkness. From time to time he would murmur:\n\n\"There's something. What is it? I wonder what it is.\"\n\nWhat strange sixth sense stirred in McTeague at this time? What animal\ncunning, what brute instinct clamored for recognition and obedience?\nWhat lower faculty was it that roused his suspicion, that drove him out\ninto the night a score of times between dark and dawn, his head in the\nair, his eyes and ears keenly alert?\n\nOne night as he stood on the steps of the bunk house, peering into the\nshadows of the camp, he uttered an exclamation as of a man suddenly\nenlightened. He turned back into the house, drew from under his bed the\nblanket roll in which he kept his money hid, and took the canary down\nfrom the wall. He strode to the door and disappeared into the night.\nWhen the sheriff of Placer County and the two deputies from San\nFrancisco reached the Big Dipper mine, McTeague had been gone two days.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 21\n\n\n\"Well,\" said one of the deputies, as he backed the horse into the shafts\nof the buggy in which the pursuers had driven over from the Hill, \"we've\nabout as good as got him. It isn't hard to follow a man who carries a\nbird cage with him wherever he goes.\"\n\nMcTeague crossed the mountains on foot the Friday and Saturday of\nthat week, going over through Emigrant Gap, following the line of the\nOverland railroad. He reached Reno Monday night. By degrees a vague plan\nof action outlined itself in the dentist's mind.\n\n\"Mexico,\" he muttered to himself. \"Mexico, that's the place. They'll\nwatch the coast and they'll watch the Eastern trains, but they won't\nthink of Mexico.\"\n\nThe sense of pursuit which had harassed him during the last week of his\nstay at the Big Dipper mine had worn off, and he believed himself to be\nvery cunning.\n\n\"I'm pretty far ahead now, I guess,\" he said. At Reno he boarded a\nsouth-bound freight on the line of the Carson and Colorado railroad,\npaying for a passage in the caboose. \"Freights don' run on schedule\ntime,\" he muttered, \"and a conductor on a passenger train makes it his\nbusiness to study faces. I'll stay with this train as far as it goes.\"\n\nThe freight worked slowly southward, through western Nevada, the country\nbecoming hourly more and more desolate and abandoned. After leaving\nWalker Lake the sage-brush country began, and the freight rolled heavily\nover tracks that threw off visible layers of heat. At times it stopped\nwhole half days on sidings or by water tanks, and the engineer and\nfireman came back to the caboose and played poker with the conductor and\ntrain crew. The dentist sat apart, behind the stove, smoking pipe after\npipe of cheap tobacco. Sometimes he joined in the poker games. He\nhad learned poker when a boy at the mine, and after a few deals his\nknowledge returned to him; but for the most part he was taciturn and\nunsociable, and rarely spoke to the others unless spoken to first. The\ncrew recognized the type, and the impression gained ground among them\nthat he had \"done for\" a livery-stable keeper at Truckee and was trying\nto get down into Arizona.\n\nMcTeague heard two brakemen discussing him one night as they stood\noutside by the halted train. \"The livery-stable keeper called him a\nbastard; that's what Picachos told me,\" one of them remarked, \"and\nstarted to draw his gun; an' this fellar did for him with a hayfork.\nHe's a horse doctor, this chap is, and the livery-stable keeper had got\nthe law on him so's he couldn't practise any more, an' he was sore about\nit.\"\n\nNear a place called Queen's the train reentered California, and McTeague\nobserved with relief that the line of track which had hitherto held\nwestward curved sharply to the south again. The train was unmolested;\noccasionally the crew fought with a gang of tramps who attempted to ride\nthe brake beams, and once in the northern part of Inyo County, while\nthey were halted at a water tank, an immense Indian buck, blanketed to\nthe ground, approached McTeague as he stood on the roadbed stretching\nhis legs, and without a word presented to him a filthy, crumpled letter.\nThe letter was to the effect that the buck Big Jim was a good Indian and\ndeserving of charity; the signature was illegible. The dentist stared at\nthe letter, returned it to the buck, and regained the train just as it\nstarted. Neither had spoken; the buck did not move from his position,\nand fully five minutes afterward, when the slow-moving freight was miles\naway, the dentist looked back and saw him still standing motionless\nbetween the rails, a forlorn and solitary point of red, lost in the\nimmensity of the surrounding white blur of the desert.\n\nAt length the mountains began again, rising up on either side of the\ntrack; vast, naked hills of white sand and red rock, spotted with\nblue shadows. Here and there a patch of green was spread like a gay\ntable-cloth over the sand. All at once Mount Whitney leaped over the\nhorizon. Independence was reached and passed; the freight, nearly\nemptied by now, and much shortened, rolled along the shores of Owen\nLake. At a place called Keeler it stopped definitely. It was the\nterminus of the road.\n\nThe town of Keeler was a one-street town, not unlike Iowa Hill--the\npost-office, the bar and hotel, the Odd Fellows' Hall, and the livery\nstable being the principal buildings.\n\n\"Where to now?\" muttered McTeague to himself as he sat on the edge of\nthe bed in his room in the hotel. He hung the canary in the window,\nfilled its little bathtub, and watched it take its bath with enormous\nsatisfaction. \"Where to now?\" he muttered again. \"This is as far as the\nrailroad goes, an' it won' do for me to stay in a town yet a while; no,\nit won' do. I got to clear out. Where to? That's the word, where to?\nI'll go down to supper now\"--He went on whispering his thoughts aloud,\nso that they would take more concrete shape in his mind--\"I'll go down\nto supper now, an' then I'll hang aroun' the bar this evening till I get\nthe lay of this land. Maybe this is fruit country, though it looks more\nlike a cattle country. Maybe it's a mining country. If it's a mining\ncountry,\" he continued, puckering his heavy eyebrows, \"if it's a mining\ncountry, an' the mines are far enough off the roads, maybe I'd better\nget to the mines an' lay quiet for a month before I try to get any\nfarther south.\"\n\nHe washed the cinders and dust of a week's railroading from his face\nand hair, put on a fresh pair of boots, and went down to supper. The\ndining-room was of the invariable type of the smaller interior towns\nof California. There was but one table, covered with oilcloth; rows of\nbenches answered for chairs; a railroad map, a chromo with a gilt\nframe protected by mosquito netting, hung on the walls, together with a\nyellowed photograph of the proprietor in Masonic regalia. Two waitresses\nwhom the guests--all men--called by their first names, came and went\nwith large trays.\n\nThrough the windows outside McTeague observed a great number of saddle\nhorses tied to trees and fences. Each one of these horses had a riata on\nthe pommel of the saddle. He sat down to the table, eating his thick hot\nsoup, watching his neighbors covertly, listening to everything that was\nsaid. It did not take him long to gather that the country to the east\nand south of Keeler was a cattle country.\n\nNot far off, across a range of hills, was the Panamint Valley, where the\nbig cattle ranges were. Every now and then this name was tossed to\nand fro across the table in the flow of conversation--\"Over in the\nPanamint.\" \"Just going down for a rodeo in the Panamint.\" \"Panamint\nbrands.\" \"Has a range down in the Panamint.\" Then by and by the remark,\n\"Hoh, yes, Gold Gulch, they're down to good pay there. That's on the\nother side of the Panamint Range. Peters came in yesterday and told me.\"\n\nMcTeague turned to the speaker.\n\n\"Is that a gravel mine?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, no, quartz.\"\n\n\"I'm a miner; that's why I asked.\"\n\n\"Well I've mined some too. I had a hole in the ground meself, but she\nwas silver; and when the skunks at Washington lowered the price of\nsilver, where was I? Fitchered, b'God!\"\n\n\"I was looking for a job.\"\n\n\"Well, it's mostly cattle down here in the Panamint, but since the\nstrike over at Gold Gulch some of the boys have gone prospecting.\nThere's gold in them damn Panamint Mountains. If you can find a good\nlong 'contact' of country rocks you ain't far from it. There's a couple\nof fellars from Redlands has located four claims around Gold Gulch. They\ngot a vein eighteen inches wide, an' Peters says you can trace it for\nmore'n a thousand feet. Were you thinking of prospecting over there?\"\n\n\"Well, well, I don' know, I don' know.\"\n\n\"Well, I'm going over to the other side of the range day after t'morrow\nafter some ponies of mine, an' I'm going to have a look around. You say\nyou've been a miner?\"\n\n\"Yes, yes.\"\n\n\"If you're going over that way, you might come along and see if we can't\nfind a contact, or copper sulphurets, or something. Even if we don't\nfind color we may find silver-bearing galena.\" Then, after a pause,\n\"Let's see, I didn't catch your name.\"\n\n\"Huh? My name's Carter,\" answered McTeague, promptly. Why he should\nchange his name again the dentist could not say. \"Carter\" came to his\nmind at once, and he answered without reflecting that he had registered\nas \"Burlington\" when he had arrived at the hotel.\n\n\"Well, my name's Cribbens,\" answered the other. The two shook hands\nsolemnly.\n\n\"You're about finished?\" continued Cribbens, pushing back. \"Le's go out\nin the bar an' have a drink on it.\"\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" said the dentist.\n\nThe two sat up late that night in a corner of the barroom discussing\nthe probability of finding gold in the Panamint hills. It soon became\nevident that they held differing theories. McTeague clung to the old\nprospector's idea that there was no way of telling where gold was until\nyou actually saw it. Cribbens had evidently read a good many books upon\nthe subject, and had already prospected in something of a scientific\nmanner.\n\n\"Shucks!\" he exclaimed. \"Gi' me a long distinct contact between\nsedimentary and igneous rocks, an' I'll sink a shaft without ever SEEING\n'color.'\"\n\nThe dentist put his huge chin in the air. \"Gold is where you find it,\"\nhe returned, doggedly.\n\n\"Well, it's my idea as how pardners ought to work along different\nlines,\" said Cribbens. He tucked the corners of his mustache into\nhis mouth and sucked the tobacco juice from them. For a moment he was\nthoughtful, then he blew out his mustache abruptly, and exclaimed:\n\n\"Say, Carter, le's make a go of this. You got a little cash I\nsuppose--fifty dollars or so?\"\n\n\"Huh? Yes--I--I--\"\n\n\"Well, I got about fifty. We'll go pardners on the proposition, an'\nwe'll dally 'round the range yonder an' see what we can see. What do you\nsay?\"\n\n\"Sure, sure,\" answered the dentist.\n\n\"Well, it's a go then, hey?\"\n\n\"That's the word.\"\n\n\"Well, le's have a drink on it.\"\n\nThey drank with profound gravity.\n\nThey fitted out the next day at the general merchandise store of\nKeeler--picks, shovels, prospectors' hammers, a couple of cradles, pans,\nbacon, flour, coffee, and the like, and they bought a burro on which to\npack their kit.\n\n\"Say, by jingo, you ain't got a horse,\" suddenly exclaimed Cribbens as\nthey came out of the store. \"You can't get around this country without a\npony of some kind.\"\n\nCribbens already owned and rode a buckskin cayuse that had to be knocked\nin the head and stunned before it could be saddled. \"I got an extry\nsaddle an' a headstall at the hotel that you can use,\" he said, \"but\nyou'll have to get a horse.\"\n\nIn the end the dentist bought a mule at the livery stable for forty\ndollars. It turned out to be a good bargain, however, for the mule was\na good traveller and seemed actually to fatten on sage-brush and potato\nparings. When the actual transaction took place, McTeague had been\nobliged to get the money to pay for the mule out of the canvas sack.\nCribbens was with him at the time, and as the dentist unrolled his\nblankets and disclosed the sack, whistled in amazement.\n\n\"An' me asking you if you had fifty dollars!\" he exclaimed. \"You carry\nyour mine right around with you, don't you?\"\n\n\"Huh, I guess so,\" muttered the dentist. \"I--I just sold a claim I had\nup in El Dorado County,\" he added.\n\nAt five o'clock on a magnificent May morning the \"pardners\" jogged out\nof Keeler, driving the burro before them. Cribbens rode his cayuse,\nMcTeague following in his rear on the mule.\n\n\"Say,\" remarked Cribbens, \"why in thunder don't you leave that fool\ncanary behind at the hotel? It's going to be in your way all the time,\nan' it will sure die. Better break its neck an' chuck it.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" insisted the dentist. \"I've had it too long. I'll take it with\nme.\"\n\n\"Well, that's the craziest idea I ever heard of,\" remarked Cribbens, \"to\ntake a canary along prospecting. Why not kid gloves, and be done with\nit?\"\n\nThey travelled leisurely to the southeast during the day, following a\nwell-beaten cattle road, and that evening camped on a spur of some hills\nat the head of the Panamint Valley where there was a spring. The next\nday they crossed the Panamint itself.\n\n\"That's a smart looking valley,\" observed the dentist.\n\n\"NOW you're talking straight talk,\" returned Cribbens, sucking his\nmustache. The valley was beautiful, wide, level, and very green.\nEverywhere were herds of cattle, scarcely less wild than deer. Once or\ntwice cowboys passed them on the road, big-boned fellows, picturesque\nin their broad hats, hairy trousers, jingling spurs, and revolver\nbelts, surprisingly like the pictures McTeague remembered to have seen.\nEveryone of them knew Cribbens, and almost invariably joshed him on his\nventure.\n\n\"Say, Crib, ye'd best take a wagon train with ye to bring your dust\nback.\"\n\nCribbens resented their humor, and after they had passed, chewed\nfiercely on his mustache.\n\n\"I'd like to make a strike, b'God! if it was only to get the laugh on\nthem joshers.\"\n\nBy noon they were climbing the eastern slope of the Panamint Range. Long\nsince they had abandoned the road; vegetation ceased; not a tree was in\nsight. They followed faint cattle trails that led from one water hole to\nanother. By degrees these water holes grew dryer and dryer, and at three\no'clock Cribbens halted and filled their canteens.\n\n\"There ain't any TOO much water on the other side,\" he observed grimly.\n\n\"It's pretty hot,\" muttered the dentist, wiping his streaming forehead\nwith the back of his hand.\n\n\"Huh!\" snorted the other more grimly than ever. The motionless air\nwas like the mouth of a furnace. Cribbens's pony lathered and panted.\nMcTeague's mule began to droop his long ears. Only the little burro\nplodded resolutely on, picking the trail where McTeague could see but\ntrackless sand and stunted sage. Towards evening Cribbens, who was in\nthe lead, drew rein on the summit of the hills.\n\nBehind them was the beautiful green Panamint Valley, but before and\nbelow them for miles and miles, as far as the eye could reach, a flat,\nwhite desert, empty even of sage-brush, unrolled toward the horizon. In\nthe immediate foreground a broken system of arroyos, and little ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3ns\ntumbled down to meet it. To the north faint blue hills shouldered\nthemselves above the horizon.\n\n\"Well,\" observed Cribbens, \"we're on the top of the Panamint Range now.\nIt's along this eastern slope, right below us here, that we're going to\nprospect. Gold Gulch\"--he pointed with the butt of his quirt--\"is about\neighteen or nineteen miles along here to the north of us. Those hills\nway over yonder to the northeast are the Telescope hills.\"\n\n\"What do you call the desert out yonder?\" McTeague's eyes wandered over\nthe illimitable stretch of alkali that stretched out forever and forever\nto the east, to the north, and to the south.\n\n\"That,\" said Cribbens, \"that's Death Valley.\"\n\nThere was a long pause. The horses panted irregularly, the sweat\ndripping from their heaving bellies. Cribbens and the dentist\nsat motionless in their saddles, looking out over that abominable\ndesolation, silent, troubled.\n\n\"God!\" ejaculated Cribbens at length, under his breath, with a shake of\nhis head. Then he seemed to rouse himself. \"Well,\" he remarked, \"first\nthing we got to do now is to find water.\"\n\nThis was a long and difficult task. They descended into one little\nca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3n after another, followed the course of numberless arroyos, and\neven dug where there seemed indications of moisture, all to no purpose.\nBut at length McTeague's mule put his nose in the air and blew once or\ntwice through his nostrils.\n\n\"Smells it, the son of a gun!\" exclaimed Cribbens. The dentist let the\nanimal have his head, and in a few minutes he had brought them to the\nbed of a tiny ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3n where a thin stream of brackish water filtered over\na ledge of rocks.\n\n\"We'll camp here,\" observed Cribbens, \"but we can't turn the horses\nloose. We'll have to picket 'em with the lariats. I saw some loco-weed\nback here a piece, and if they get to eating that, they'll sure go plum\ncrazy. The burro won't eat it, but I wouldn't trust the others.\"\n\nA new life began for McTeague. After breakfast the \"pardners\" separated,\ngoing in opposite directions along the slope of the range, examining\nrocks, picking and chipping at ledges and bowlders, looking for signs,\nprospecting. McTeague went up into the little ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3ns where the streams\nhad cut through the bed rock, searching for veins of quartz, breaking\nout this quartz when he had found it, pulverizing and panning it.\nCribbens hunted for \"contacts,\" closely examining country rocks and\nout-crops, continually on the lookout for spots where sedimentary and\nigneous rock came together.\n\nOne day, after a week of prospecting, they met unexpectedly on the slope\nof an arroyo. It was late in the afternoon. \"Hello, pardner,\" exclaimed\nCribbens as he came down to where McTeague was bending over his pan.\n\"What luck?\"\n\nThe dentist emptied his pan and straightened up. \"Nothing, nothing. You\nstruck anything?\"\n\n\"Not a trace. Guess we might as well be moving towards camp.\" They\nreturned together, Cribbens telling the dentist of a group of antelope\nhe had seen.\n\n\"We might lay off to-morrow, an' see if we can plug a couple of them\nfellers. Antelope steak would go pretty well after beans an' bacon an'\ncoffee week in an' week out.\"\n\nMcTeague was answering, when Cribbens interrupted him with an\nexclamation of profound disgust. \"I thought we were the first to\nprospect along in here, an' now look at that. Don't it make you sick?\"\n\nHe pointed out evidences of an abandoned prospector's camp just before\nthem--charred ashes, empty tin cans, one or two gold-miner's pans, and a\nbroken pick. \"Don't that make you sick?\" muttered Cribbens, sucking his\nmustache furiously. \"To think of us mushheads going over ground that's\nbeen covered already! Say, pardner, we'll dig out of here to-morrow.\nI've been thinking, anyhow, we'd better move to the south; that water of\nours is pretty low.\"\n\n\"Yes, yes, I guess so,\" assented the dentist. \"There ain't any gold\nhere.\"\n\n\"Yes, there is,\" protested Cribbens doggedly; \"there's gold all through\nthese hills, if we could only strike it. I tell you what, pardner, I got\na place in mind where I'll bet no one ain't prospected--least not very\nmany. There don't very many care to try an' get to it. It's over on the\nother side of Death Valley. It's called Gold Mountain, an' there's only\none mine been located there, an' it's paying like a nitrate bed. There\nain't many people in that country, because it's all hell to get into.\nFirst place, you got to cross Death Valley and strike the Armagosa Range\nfur off to the south. Well, no one ain't stuck on crossing the Valley,\nnot if they can help it. But we could work down the Panamint some\nhundred or so miles, maybe two hundred, an' fetch around by the Armagosa\nRiver, way to the south'erd. We could prospect on the way. But I guess\nthe Armagosa'd be dried up at this season. Anyhow,\" he concluded, \"we'll\nmove camp to the south to-morrow. We got to get new feed an' water\nfor the horses. We'll see if we can knock over a couple of antelope\nto-morrow, and then we'll scoot.\"\n\n\"I ain't got a gun,\" said the dentist; \"not even a revolver. I--\"\n\n\"Wait a second,\" said Cribbens, pausing in his scramble down the side\nof one of the smaller gulches. \"Here's some slate here; I ain't seen no\nslate around here yet. Let's see where it goes to.\"\n\nMcTeague followed him along the side of the gulch. Cribbens went on\nahead, muttering to himself from time to time:\n\n\"Runs right along here, even enough, and here's water too. Didn't know\nthis stream was here; pretty near dry, though. Here's the slate again.\nSee where it runs, pardner?\"\n\n\"Look at it up there ahead,\" said McTeague. \"It runs right up over the\nback of this hill.\"\n\n\"That's right,\" assented Cribbens. \"Hi!\" he shouted suddenly, \"HERE'S A\n'CONTACT,' and here it is again, and there, and yonder. Oh, look at\nit, will you? That's granodiorite on slate. Couldn't want it any more\ndistinct than that. GOD! if we could only find the quartz between the\ntwo now.\"\n\n\"Well, there it is,\" exclaimed McTeague. \"Look on ahead there; ain't\nthat quartz?\"\n\n\"You're shouting right out loud,\" vociferated Cribbens, looking where\nMcTeague was pointing. His face went suddenly pale. He turned to the\ndentist, his eyes wide.\n\n\"By God, pardner,\" he exclaimed, breathlessly. \"By God--\" he broke off\nabruptly.\n\n\"That's what you been looking for, ain't it?\" asked the dentist.\n\n\"LOOKING for! LOOKING for!\" Cribbens checked himself. \"That's SLATE all\nright, and that's granodiorite, I know\"--he bent down and examined the\nrock--\"and here's the quartz between 'em; there can't be no mistake\nabout that. Gi' me that hammer,\" he cried, excitedly. \"Come on, git to\nwork. Jab into the quartz with your pick; git out some chunks of it.\"\nCribbens went down on his hands and knees, attacking the quartz vein\nfuriously. The dentist followed his example, swinging his pick with\nenormous force, splintering the rocks at every stroke. Cribbens was\ntalking to himself in his excitement.\n\n\"Got you THIS time, you son of a gun! By God! I guess we got you THIS\ntime, at last. Looks like it, anyhow. GET a move on, pardner. There\nain't anybody 'round, is there? Hey?\" Without looking, he drew his\nrevolver and threw it to the dentist. \"Take the gun an' look around,\npardner. If you see any son of a gun ANYWHERE, PLUG him. This yere's OUR\nclaim. I guess we got it THIS tide, pardner. Come on.\" He gathered up\nthe chunks of quartz he had broken out, and put them in his hat and\nstarted towards their camp. The two went along with great strides,\nhurrying as fast as they could over the uneven ground.\n\n\"I don' know,\" exclaimed Cribbens, breathlessly, \"I don' want to say too\nmuch. Maybe we're fooled. Lord, that damn camp's a long ways off. Oh, I\nain't goin' to fool along this way. Come on, pardner.\" He broke into a\nrun. McTeague followed at a lumbering gallop. Over the scorched, parched\nground, stumbling and tripping over sage-brush and sharp-pointed rocks,\nunder the palpitating heat of the desert sun, they ran and scrambled,\ncarrying the quartz lumps in their hats.\n\n\"See any 'COLOR' in it, pardner?\" gasped Cribbens. \"I can't, can you?\n'Twouldn't be visible nohow, I guess. Hurry up. Lord, we ain't ever\ngoing to get to that camp.\"\n\nFinally they arrived. Cribbens dumped the quartz fragments into a pan.\n\n\"You pestle her, pardner, an' I'll fix the scales.\" McTeague ground the\nlumps to fine dust in the iron mortar while Cribbens set up the tiny\nscales and got out the \"spoons\" from their outfit.\n\n\"That's fine enough,\" Cribbens exclaimed, impatiently. \"Now we'll spoon\nher. Gi' me the water.\"\n\nCribbens scooped up a spoonful of the fine white powder and began to\nspoon it carefully. The two were on their hands and knees upon the\nground, their heads close together, still panting with excitement and\nthe exertion of their run.\n\n\"Can't do it,\" exclaimed Cribbens, sitting back on his heels, \"hand\nshakes so. YOU take it, pardner. Careful, now.\"\n\nMcTeague took the horn spoon and began rocking it gently in his huge\nfingers, sluicing the water over the edge a little at a time, each\nmovement washing away a little more of the powdered quartz. The two\nwatched it with the intensest eagerness.\n\n\"Don't see it yet; don't see it yet,\" whispered Cribbens, chewing his\nmustache. \"LEETLE faster, pardner. That's the ticket. Careful, steady,\nnow; leetle more, leetle more. Don't see color yet, do you?\"\n\nThe quartz sediment dwindled by degrees as McTeague spooned it steadily.\nThen at last a thin streak of a foreign substance began to show just\nalong the edge. It was yellow.\n\nNeither spoke. Cribbens dug his nails into the sand, and ground his\nmustache between his teeth. The yellow streak broadened as the quartz\nsediment washed away. Cribbens whispered:\n\n\"We got it, pardner. That's gold.\"\n\nMcTeague washed the last of the white quartz dust away, and let the\nwater trickle after it. A pinch of gold, fine as flour, was left in the\nbottom of the spoon.\n\n\"There you are,\" he said. The two looked at each other. Then Cribbens\nrose into the air with a great leap and a yell that could have been\nheard for half a mile.\n\n\"Yee-e-ow! We GOT it, we struck it. Pardner, we got it. Out of sight.\nWe're millionaires.\" He snatched up his revolver and fired it with\ninconceivable rapidity. \"PUT it there, old man,\" he shouted, gripping\nMcTeague's palm.\n\n\"That's gold, all right,\" muttered McTeague, studying the contents of\nthe spoon.\n\n\"You bet your great-grandma's Cochin-China Chessy cat it's gold,\"\nshouted Cribbens. \"Here, now, we got a lot to do. We got to stake her\nout an' put up the location notice. We'll take our full acreage, you\nbet. You--we haven't weighed this yet. Where's the scales?\" He weighed\nthe pinch of gold with shaking hands. \"Two grains,\" he cried. \"That'll\nrun five dollars to the ton. Rich, it's rich; it's the richest kind of\npay, pardner. We're millionaires. Why don't you say something? Why don't\nyou get excited? Why don't you run around an' do something?\"\n\n\"Huh!\" said McTeague, rolling his eyes. \"Huh! I know, I know, we've\nstruck it pretty rich.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" exclaimed Cribbens, jumping up again. \"We'll stake her out\nan' put up the location notice. Lord, suppose anyone should have come\non her while we've been away.\" He reloaded his revolver deliberately.\n\"We'll drop HIM all right, if there's anyone fooling round there; I'll\ntell you those right now. Bring the rifle, pardner, an' if you see\nanyone, PLUG him, an' ask him what he wants afterward.\"\n\nThey hurried back to where they had made their discovery.\n\n\"To think,\" exclaimed Cribbens, as he drove the first stake, \"to think\nthose other mushheads had their camp within gunshot of her and never\nlocated her. Guess they didn't know the meaning of a 'contact.' Oh, I\nknew I was solid on 'contacts.'\"\n\nThey staked out their claim, and Cribbens put up the notice of location.\nIt was dark before they were through. Cribbens broke off some more\nchunks of quarts in the vein.\n\n\"I'll spoon this too, just for the fun of it, when I get home,\" he\nexplained, as they tramped back to the camp.\n\n\"Well,\" said the dentist, \"we got the laugh on those cowboys.\"\n\n\"Have we?\" shouted Cribbens. \"HAVE we? Just wait and see the rush for\nthis place when we tell 'em about it down in Keeler. Say, what'll we\ncall her?\"\n\n\"I don' know, I don' know.\"\n\n\"We might call her the 'Last Chance.' 'Twas our last chance, wasn't\nit? We'd 'a' gone antelope shooting tomorrow, and the next day we'd\n'a'--say, what you stopping for?\" he added, interrupting himself.\n\"What's up?\"\n\nThe dentist had paused abruptly on the crest of a ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3n. Cribbens,\nlooking back, saw him standing motionless in his tracks.\n\n\"What's up?\" asked Cribbens a second time.\n\nMcTeague slowly turned his head and looked over one shoulder, then over\nthe other. Suddenly he wheeled sharply about, cocking the Winchester and\ntossing it to his shoulder. Cribbens ran back to his side, whipping out\nhis revolver.\n\n\"What is it?\" he cried. \"See anybody?\" He peered on ahead through the\ngathering twilight.\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\"Hear anything?\"\n\n\"No, didn't hear anything.\"\n\n\"What is it then? What's up?\"\n\n\"I don' know, I don' know,\" muttered the dentist, lowering the rifle.\n\"There was something.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Something--didn't you notice?\"\n\n\"Notice what?\"\n\n\"I don' know. Something--something or other.\"\n\n\"Who? What? Notice what? What did you see?\"\n\nThe dentist let down the hammer of the rifle.\n\n\"I guess it wasn't anything,\" he said rather foolishly.\n\n\"What d'you think you saw--anybody on the claim?\"\n\n\"I didn't see anything. I didn't hear anything either. I had an idea,\nthat's all; came all of a sudden, like that. Something, I don' know\nwhat.\"\n\n\"I guess you just imagined something. There ain't anybody within twenty\nmiles of us, I guess.\"\n\n\"Yes, I guess so, just imagined it, that's the word.\"\n\nHalf an hour later they had the fire going. McTeague was frying\nstrips of bacon over the coals, and Cribbens was still chattering and\nexclaiming over their great strike. All at once McTeague put down the\nfrying-pan.\n\n\"What's that?\" he growled.\n\n\"Hey? What's what?\" exclaimed Cribbens, getting up.\n\n\"Didn't you notice something?\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Off there.\" The dentist made a vague gesture toward the eastern\nhorizon. \"Didn't you hear something--I mean see something--I mean--\"\n\n\"What's the matter with you, pardner?\"\n\n\"Nothing. I guess I just imagined it.\"\n\nBut it was not imagination. Until midnight the partners lay broad awake,\nrolled in their blankets under the open sky, talking and discussing and\nmaking plans. At last Cribbens rolled over on his side and slept. The\ndentist could not sleep.\n\nWhat! It was warning him again, that strange sixth sense, that obscure\nbrute instinct. It was aroused again and clamoring to be obeyed. Here,\nin these desolate barren hills, twenty miles from the nearest human\nbeing, it stirred and woke and rowelled him to be moving on. It had\ngoaded him to flight from the Big Dipper mine, and he had obeyed. But\nnow it was different; now he had suddenly become rich; he had lighted\non a treasure--a treasure far more valuable than the Big Dipper mine\nitself. How was he to leave that? He could not move on now. He turned\nabout in his blankets. No, he would not move on. Perhaps it was his\nfancy, after all. He saw nothing, heard nothing. The emptiness of\nprimeval desolation stretched from him leagues and leagues upon either\nhand. The gigantic silence of the night lay close over everything, like\na muffling Titanic palm. Of what was he suspicious? In that treeless\nwaste an object could be seen at half a day's journey distant. In that\nvast silence the click of a pebble was as audible as a pistol-shot. And\nyet there was nothing, nothing.\n\nThe dentist settled himself in his blankets and tried to sleep. In five\nminutes he was sitting up, staring into the blue-gray shimmer of the\nmoonlight, straining his ears, watching and listening intently. Nothing\nwas in sight. The browned and broken flanks of the Panamint hills lay\nquiet and familiar under the moon. The burro moved its head with a\nclinking of its bell; and McTeagues mule, dozing on three legs, changed\nits weight to another foot, with a long breath. Everything fell silent\nagain.\n\n\"What is it?\" muttered the dentist. \"If I could only see something, hear\nsomething.\"\n\nHe threw off the blankets, and, rising, climbed to the summit of the\nnearest hill and looked back in the direction in which he and Cribbens\nhad travelled a fortnight before. For half an hour he waited, watching\nand listening in vain. But as he returned to camp, and prepared to roll\nhis blankets about him, the strange impulse rose in him again abruptly,\nnever so strong, never so insistent. It seemed as though he were bitted\nand ridden; as if some unseen hand were turning him toward the east;\nsome unseen heel spurring him to precipitate and instant flight.\n\nFlight from what? \"No,\" he muttered under his breath. \"Go now and leave\nthe claim, and leave a fortune! What a fool I'd be, when I can't see\nanything or hear anything. To leave a fortune! No, I won't. No, by God!\"\nHe drew Cribbens's Winchester toward him and slipped a cartridge into\nthe magazine.\n\n\"No,\" he growled. \"Whatever happens, I'm going to stay. If anybody\ncomes--\" He depressed the lever of the rifle, and sent the cartridge\nclashing into the breech.\n\n\"I ain't going to sleep,\" he muttered under his mustache. \"I can't\nsleep; I'll watch.\" He rose a second time, clambered to the nearest\nhilltop and sat down, drawing the blanket around him, and laying the\nWinchester across his knees. The hours passed. The dentist sat on the\nhilltop a motionless, crouching figure, inky black against the pale\nblur of the sky. By and by the edge of the eastern horizon began to grow\nblacker and more distinct in out-line. The dawn was coming. Once more\nMcTeague felt the mysterious intuition of approaching danger; an unseen\nhand seemed reining his head eastward; a spur was in his flanks that\nseemed to urge him to hurry, hurry, hurry. The influence grew stronger\nwith every moment. The dentist set his great jaws together and held his\nground.\n\n\"No,\" he growled between his set teeth. \"No, I'll stay.\" He made a long\ncircuit around the camp, even going as far as the first stake of the new\nclaim, his Winchester cocked, his ears pricked, his eyes alert. There\nwas nothing; yet as plainly as though it were shouted at the very nape\nof his neck he felt an enemy. It was not fear. McTeague was not afraid.\n\n\"If I could only SEE something--somebody,\" he muttered, as he held the\ncocked rifle ready, \"I--I'd show him.\"\n\nHe returned to camp. Cribbens was snoring. The burro had come down\nto the stream for its morning drink. The mule was awake and browsing.\nMcTeague stood irresolutely by the cold ashes of the camp-fire, looking\nfrom side to side with all the suspicion and wariness of a tracked stag.\nStronger and stronger grew the strange impulse. It seemed to him that on\nthe next instant he MUST perforce wheel sharply eastward and rush away\nheadlong in a clumsy, lumbering gallop. He fought against it with all\nthe ferocious obstinacy of his simple brute nature.\n\n\"Go, and leave the mine? Go and leave a million dollars? No, NO, I won't\ngo. No, I'll stay. Ah,\" he exclaimed, under his breath, with a shake\nof his huge head, like an exasperated and harassed brute, \"ah, show\nyourself, will you?\" He brought the rifle to his shoulder and covered\npoint after point along the range of hills to the west. \"Come on, show\nyourself. Come on a little, all of you. I ain't afraid of you; but don't\nskulk this way. You ain't going to drive me away from my mine. I'm going\nto stay.\"\n\nAn hour passed. Then two. The stars winked out, and the dawn whitened.\nThe air became warmer. The whole east, clean of clouds, flamed\nopalescent from horizon to zenith, crimson at the base, where the earth\nblackened against it; at the top fading from pink to pale yellow, to\ngreen, to light blue, to the turquoise iridescence of the desert sky.\nThe long, thin shadows of the early hours drew backward like receding\nserpents, then suddenly the sun looked over the shoulder of the world,\nand it was day.\n\nAt that moment McTeague was already eight miles away from the camp,\ngoing steadily eastward. He was descending the lowest spurs of the\nPanamint hills, following an old and faint cattle trail. Before him he\ndrove his mule, laden with blankets, provisions for six days, Cribben's\nrifle, and a canteen full of water. Securely bound to the pommel of the\nsaddle was the canvas sack with its precious five thousand dollars, all\nin twenty-dollar gold pieces. But strange enough in that horrid waste\nof sand and sage was the object that McTeague himself persistently\ncarried--the canary in its cage, about which he had carefully wrapped a\ncouple of old flour-bags.\n\nAt about five o'clock that morning McTeague had crossed several trails\nwhich seemed to be converging, and, guessing that they led to a water\nhole, had followed one of them and had brought up at a sort of small\nsundried sink which nevertheless contained a little water at the bottom.\nHe had watered the mule here, refilled the canteen, and drank deep\nhimself. He had also dampened the old flour-sacks around the bird cage\nto protect the little canary as far as possible from the heat that he\nknew would increase now with every hour. He had made ready to go forward\nagain, but had paused irresolute again, hesitating for the last time.\n\n\"I'm a fool,\" he growled, scowling back at the range behind him. \"I'm\na fool. What's the matter with me? I'm just walking right away from a\nmillion dollars. I know it's there. No, by God!\" he exclaimed, savagely,\n\"I ain't going to do it. I'm going back. I can't leave a mine like\nthat.\" He had wheeled the mule about, and had started to return on\nhis tracks, grinding his teeth fiercely, inclining his head forward as\nthough butting against a wind that would beat him back. \"Go on, go on,\"\nhe cried, sometimes addressing the mule, sometimes himself. \"Go on, go\nback, go back. I WILL go back.\" It was as though he were climbing a\nhill that grew steeper with every stride. The strange impelling instinct\nfought his advance yard by yard. By degrees the dentist's steps grew\nslower; he stopped, went forward again cautiously, almost feeling his\nway, like someone approaching a pit in the darkness. He stopped again,\nhesitating, gnashing his teeth, clinching his fists with blind fury.\nSuddenly he turned the mule about, and once more set his face to the\neastward.\n\n\"I can't,\" he cried aloud to the desert; \"I can't, I can't. It's\nstronger than I am. I CAN'T go back. Hurry now, hurry, hurry, hurry.\"\n\nHe hastened on furtively, his head and shoulders bent. At times one\ncould almost say he crouched as he pushed forward with long strides;\nnow and then he even looked over his shoulder. Sweat rolled from him,\nhe lost his hat, and the matted mane of thick yellow hair swept over his\nforehead and shaded his small, twinkling eyes. At times, with a vague,\nnearly automatic gesture, he reached his hand forward, the fingers\nprehensile, and directed towards the horizon, as if he would clutch it\nand draw it nearer; and at intervals he muttered, \"Hurry, hurry, hurry\non, hurry on.\" For now at last McTeague was afraid.\n\nHis plans were uncertain. He remembered what Cribbens had said about the\nArmagosa Mountains in the country on the other side of Death Valley. It\nwas all hell to get into that country, Cribbens had said, and not many\nmen went there, because of the terrible valley of alkali that barred\nthe way, a horrible vast sink of white sand and salt below even the sea\nlevel, the dry bed, no doubt, of some prehistoric lake. But McTeague\nresolved to make a circuit of the valley, keeping to the south, until he\nshould strike the Armagosa River. He would make a circuit of the valley\nand come up on the other side. He would get into that country around\nGold Mountain in the Armagosa hills, barred off from the world by the\nleagues of the red-hot alkali of Death Valley. \"They\" would hardly reach\nhim there. He would stay at Gold Mountain two or three months, and then\nwork his way down into Mexico.\n\nMcTeague tramped steadily forward, still descending the lower\nirregularities of the Panamint Range. By nine o'clock the slope\nflattened out abruptly; the hills were behind him; before him, to the\neast, all was level. He had reached the region where even the sand and\nsage-brush begin to dwindle, giving place to white, powdered alkali.\nThe trails were numerous, but old and faint; and they had been made by\ncattle, not by men. They led in all directions but one--north, south,\nand west; but not one, however faint, struck out towards the valley.\n\n\"If I keep along the edge of the hills where these trails are,\" muttered\nthe dentist, \"I ought to find water up in the arroyos from time to\ntime.\"\n\nAt once he uttered an exclamation. The mule had begun to squeal and lash\nout with alternate hoofs, his eyes rolling, his ears flattened. He ran a\nfew steps, halted, and squealed again. Then, suddenly wheeling at right\nangles, set off on a jog trot to the north, squealing and kicking from\ntime to time. McTeague ran after him shouting and swearing, but for a\nlong time the mule would not allow himself to be caught. He seemed more\nbewildered than frightened.\n\n\"He's eatun some of that loco-weed that Cribbens spoke about,\" panted\nMcTeague. \"Whoa, there; steady, you.\" At length the mule stopped of his\nown accord, and seemed to come to his senses again. McTeague came up and\ntook the bridle rein, speaking to him and rubbing his nose.\n\n\"There, there, what's the matter with you?\" The mule was docile again.\nMcTeague washed his mouth and set forward once more.\n\nThe day was magnificent. From horizon to horizon was one vast span of\nblue, whitening as it dipped earthward. Miles upon miles to the east\nand southeast the desert unrolled itself, white, naked, inhospitable,\npalpitating and shimmering under the sun, unbroken by so much as a rock\nor cactus stump. In the distance it assumed all manner of faint colors,\npink, purple, and pale orange. To the west rose the Panamint Range,\nsparsely sprinkled with gray sagebrush; here the earths and sands were\nyellow, ochre, and rich, deep red, the hollows and ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3ns picked out\nwith intense blue shadows. It seemed strange that such barrenness\ncould exhibit this radiance of color, but nothing could have been more\nbeautiful than the deep red of the higher bluffs and ridges, seamed with\npurple shadows, standing sharply out against the pale-blue whiteness of\nthe horizon.\n\nBy nine o'clock the sun stood high in the sky. The heat was intense; the\natmosphere was thick and heavy with it. McTeague gasped for breath and\nwiped the beads of perspiration from his forehead, his cheeks, and his\nneck. Every inch and pore of his skin was tingling and pricking under\nthe merciless lash of the sun's rays.\n\n\"If it gets much hotter,\" he muttered, with a long breath, \"if it gets\nmuch hotter, I--I don' know--\" He wagged his head and wiped the sweat\nfrom his eyelids, where it was running like tears.\n\nThe sun rose higher; hour by hour, as the dentist tramped steadily on,\nthe heat increased. The baked dry sand crackled into innumerable tiny\nflakes under his feet. The twigs of the sage-brush snapped like brittle\npipestems as he pushed through them. It grew hotter. At eleven the earth\nwas like the surface of a furnace; the air, as McTeague breathed it in,\nwas hot to his lips and the roof of his mouth. The sun was a disk\nof molten brass swimming in the burnt-out blue of the sky. McTeague\nstripped off his woollen shirt, and even unbuttoned his flannel\nundershirt, tying a handkerchief loosely about his neck.\n\n\"Lord!\" he exclaimed. \"I never knew it COULD get as hot as this.\"\n\nThe heat grew steadily fiercer; all distant objects were visibly\nshimmering and palpitating under it. At noon a mirage appeared on the\nhills to the northwest. McTeague halted the mule, and drank from the\ntepid water in the canteen, dampening the sack around the canary's cage.\nAs soon as he ceased his tramp and the noise of his crunching, grinding\nfootsteps died away, the silence, vast, illimitable, enfolded him like\nan immeasurable tide. From all that gigantic landscape, that colossal\nreach of baking sand, there arose not a single sound. Not a twig\nrattled, not an insect hummed, not a bird or beast invaded that huge\nsolitude with call or cry. Everything as far as the eye could reach,\nto north, to south, to east, and west, lay inert, absolutely quiet and\nmoveless under the remorseless scourge of the noon sun. The very shadows\nshrank away, hiding under sage-bushes, retreating to the farthest nooks\nand crevices in the ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3ns of the hills. All the world was one gigantic\nblinding glare, silent, motionless. \"If it gets much hotter,\" murmured\nthe dentist again, moving his head from side to side, \"if it gets much\nhotter, I don' know what I'll do.\"\n\nSteadily the heat increased. At three o'clock it was even more terrible\nthan it had been at noon.\n\n\"Ain't it EVER going to let up?\" groaned the dentist, rolling his eyes\nat the sky of hot blue brass. Then, as he spoke, the stillness was\nabruptly stabbed through and through by a shrill sound that seemed to\ncome from all sides at once. It ceased; then, as McTeague took another\nforward step, began again with the suddenness of a blow, shriller,\nnearer at hand, a hideous, prolonged note that brought both man and mule\nto an instant halt.\n\n\"I know what THAT is,\" exclaimed the dentist. His eyes searched the\nground swiftly until he saw what he expected he should see--the round\nthick coil, the slowly waving clover-shaped head and erect whirring tail\nwith its vibrant rattles.\n\nFor fully thirty seconds the man and snake remained looking into each\nother's eyes. Then the snake uncoiled and swiftly wound from sight\namidst the sagebrush. McTeague drew breath again, and his eyes once more\nbeheld the illimitable leagues of quivering sand and alkali.\n\n\"Good Lord! What a country!\" he exclaimed. But his voice was trembling\nas he urged forward the mule once more.\n\nFiercer and fiercer grew the heat as the afternoon advanced. At four\nMcTeague stopped again. He was dripping at every pore, but there was no\nrelief in perspiration. The very touch of his clothes upon his body was\nunendurable. The mule's ears were drooping and his tongue lolled from\nhis mouth. The cattle trails seemed to be drawing together toward a\ncommon point; perhaps a water hole was near by.\n\n\"I'll have to lay up, sure,\" muttered the dentist. \"I ain't made to\ntravel in such heat as this.\"\n\nHe drove the mule up into one of the larger ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3ns and halted in the\nshadow of a pile of red rock. After a long search he found water, a few\nquarts, warm and brackish, at the bottom of a hollow of sunwracked mud;\nit was little more than enough to water the mule and refill his canteen.\nHere he camped, easing the mule of the saddle, and turning him loose\nto find what nourishment he might. A few hours later the sun set in a\ncloudless glory of red and gold, and the heat became by degrees less\nintolerable. McTeague cooked his supper, chiefly coffee and bacon, and\nwatched the twilight come on, revelling in the delicious coolness of\nthe evening. As he spread his blankets on the ground he resolved that\nhereafter he would travel only at night, laying up in the daytime in the\nshade of the ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3ns. He was exhausted with his terrible day's march.\nNever in his life had sleep seemed so sweet to him.\n\nBut suddenly he was broad awake, his jaded senses all alert.\n\n\"What was that?\" he muttered. \"I thought I heard something--saw\nsomething.\"\n\nHe rose to his feet, reaching for the Winchester. Desolation lay still\naround him. There was not a sound but his own breathing; on the face of\nthe desert not a grain of sand was in motion. McTeague looked furtively\nand quickly from side to side, his teeth set, his eyes rolling. Once\nmore the rowel was in his flanks, once more an unseen hand reined him\ntoward the east. After all the miles of that dreadful day's flight he\nwas no better off than when he started. If anything, he was worse, for\nnever had that mysterious instinct in him been more insistent than now;\nnever had the impulse toward precipitate flight been stronger; never had\nthe spur bit deeper. Every nerve of his body cried aloud for rest; yet\nevery instinct seemed aroused and alive, goading him to hurry on, to\nhurry on.\n\n\"What IS it, then? What is it?\" he cried, between his teeth. \"Can't I\never get rid of you? Ain't I EVER going to shake you off? Don' keep it\nup this way. Show yourselves. Let's have it out right away. Come on. I\nain't afraid if you'll only come on; but don't skulk this way.\" Suddenly\nhe cried aloud in a frenzy of exasperation, \"Damn you, come on, will\nyou? Come on and have it out.\" His rifle was at his shoulder, he was\ncovering bush after bush, rock after rock, aiming at every denser\nshadow. All at once, and quite involuntarily, his forefinger crooked,\nand the rifle spoke and flamed. The ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3ns roared back the echo,\ntossing it out far over the desert in a rippling, widening wave of\nsound.\n\nMcTeague lowered the rifle hastily, with an exclamation of dismay.\n\n\"You fool,\" he said to himself, \"you fool. You've done it now. They\ncould hear that miles away. You've done it now.\"\n\nHe stood listening intently, the rifle smoking in his hands. The last\necho died away. The smoke vanished, the vast silence closed upon the\npassing echoes of the rifle as the ocean closes upon a ship's wake.\nNothing moved; yet McTeague bestirred himself sharply, rolling up his\nblankets, resaddling the mule, getting his outfit together again. From\ntime to time he muttered:\n\n\"Hurry now; hurry on. You fool, you've done it now. They could hear that\nmiles away. Hurry now. They ain't far off now.\"\n\nAs he depressed the lever of the rifle to reload it, he found that the\nmagazine was empty. He clapped his hands to his sides, feeling rapidly\nfirst in one pocket, then in another. He had forgotten to take extra\ncartridges with him. McTeague swore under his breath as he flung the\nrifle away. Henceforth he must travel unarmed.\n\nA little more water had gathered in the mud hole near which he had\ncamped. He watered the mule for the last time and wet the sacks around\nthe canary's cage. Then once more he set forward.\n\nBut there was a change in the direction of McTeague's flight. Hitherto\nhe had held to the south, keeping upon the very edge of the hills;\nnow he turned sharply at right angles. The slope fell away beneath his\nhurrying feet; the sage-brush dwindled, and at length ceased; the sand\ngave place to a fine powder, white as snow; and an hour after he\nhad fired the rifle his mule's hoofs were crisping and cracking the\nsun-baked flakes of alkali on the surface of Death Valley.\n\nTracked and harried, as he felt himself to be, from one camping place to\nanother, McTeague had suddenly resolved to make one last effort to rid\nhimself of the enemy that seemed to hang upon his heels. He would strike\nstraight out into that horrible wilderness where even the beasts were\nafraid. He would cross Death Valley at once and put its arid wastes\nbetween him and his pursuer.\n\n\"You don't dare follow me now,\" he muttered, as he hurried on. \"Let's\nsee you come out HERE after me.\"\n\nHe hurried on swiftly, urging the mule to a rapid racking walk. Towards\nfour o'clock the sky in front of him began to flush pink and golden.\nMcTeague halted and breakfasted, pushing on again immediately afterward.\nThe dawn flamed and glowed like a brazier, and the sun rose a vast\nred-hot coal floating in fire. An hour passed, then another, and\nanother. It was about nine o'clock. Once more the dentist paused, and\nstood panting and blowing, his arms dangling, his eyes screwed up and\nblinking as he looked about him.\n\nFar behind him the Panamint hills were already but blue hummocks on the\nhorizon. Before him and upon either side, to the north and to the east\nand to the south, stretched primordial desolation. League upon league\nthe infinite reaches of dazzling white alkali laid themselves out like\nan immeasurable scroll unrolled from horizon to horizon; not a bush,\nnot a twig relieved that horrible monotony. Even the sand of the desert\nwould have been a welcome sight; a single clump of sage-brush would\nhave fascinated the eye; but this was worse than the desert. It was\nabominable, this hideous sink of alkali, this bed of some primeval lake\nlying so far below the level of the ocean. The great mountains of Placer\nCounty had been merely indifferent to man; but this awful sink of alkali\nwas openly and unreservedly iniquitous and malignant.\n\nMcTeague had told himself that the heat upon the lower slopes of the\nPanamint had been dreadful; here in Death Valley it became a thing of\nterror. There was no longer any shadow but his own. He was scorched\nand parched from head to heel. It seemed to him that the smart of his\ntortured body could not have been keener if he had been flayed.\n\n\"If it gets much hotter,\" he muttered, wringing the sweat from his thick\nfell of hair and mustache, \"if it gets much hotter, I don' know what\nI'll do.\" He was thirsty, and drank a little from his canteen. \"I ain't\ngot any too much water,\" he murmured, shaking the canteen. \"I got to get\nout of this place in a hurry, sure.\"\n\nBy eleven o'clock the heat had increased to such an extent that McTeague\ncould feel the burning of the ground come pringling and stinging through\nthe soles of his boots. Every step he took threw up clouds of impalpable\nalkali dust, salty and choking, so that he strangled and coughed and\nsneezed with it.\n\n\"LORD! what a country!\" exclaimed the dentist.\n\nAn hour later, the mule stopped and lay down, his jaws wide open, his\nears dangling. McTeague washed his mouth with a handful of water and for\na second time since sunrise wetted the flour-sacks around the bird cage.\nThe air was quivering and palpitating like that in the stoke-hold of a\nsteamship. The sun, small and contracted, swam molten overhead.\n\n\"I can't stand it,\" said McTeague at length. \"I'll have to stop and make\nsome kinda shade.\"\n\nThe mule was crouched upon the ground, panting rapidly, with half-closed\neyes. The dentist removed the saddle, and unrolling his blanket, propped\nit up as best he could between him and the sun. As he stooped down to\ncrawl beneath it, his palm touched the ground. He snatched it away with\na cry of pain. The surface alkali was oven-hot; he was obliged to scoop\nout a trench in it before he dared to lie down.\n\nBy degrees the dentist began to doze. He had had little or no sleep\nthe night before, and the hurry of his flight under the blazing sun had\nexhausted him. But his rest was broken; between waking and sleeping, all\nmanner of troublous images galloped through his brain. He thought he was\nback in the Panamint hills again with Cribbens. They had just discovered\nthe mine and were returning toward camp. McTeague saw himself as another\nman, striding along over the sand and sagebrush. At once he saw himself\nstop and wheel sharply about, peering back suspiciously. There was\nsomething behind him; something was following him. He looked, as it\nwere, over the shoulder of this other McTeague, and saw down there, in\nthe half light of the ca\u00c3\u00b1\u00c3\u00b3n, something dark crawling upon the ground,\nan indistinct gray figure, man or brute, he did not know. Then he saw\nanother, and another; then another. A score of black, crawling objects\nwere following him, crawling from bush to bush, converging upon him.\n\"THEY\" were after him, were closing in upon him, were within touch of\nhis hand, were at his feet--WERE AT HIS THROAT.\n\nMcTeague jumped up with a shout, oversetting the blanket. There was\nnothing in sight. For miles around, the alkali was empty, solitary,\nquivering and shimmering under the pelting fire of the afternoon's sun.\n\nBut once more the spur bit into his body, goading him on. There was to\nbe no rest, no going back, no pause, no stop. Hurry, hurry, hurry on.\nThe brute that in him slept so close to the surface was alive and alert,\nand tugging to be gone. There was no resisting that instinct. The brute\nfelt an enemy, scented the trackers, clamored and struggled and fought,\nand would not be gainsaid.\n\n\"I CAN'T go on,\" groaned McTeague, his eyes sweeping the horizon behind\nhim, \"I'm beat out. I'm dog tired. I ain't slept any for two nights.\"\nBut for all that he roused himself again, saddled the mule, scarcely\nless exhausted than himself, and pushed on once more over the scorching\nalkali and under the blazing sun.\n\nFrom that time on the fear never left him, the spur never ceased to\nbite, the instinct that goaded him to fight never was dumb; hurry or\nhalt, it was all the same. On he went, straight on, chasing the receding\nhorizon; flagellated with heat; tortured with thirst; crouching over;\nlooking furtively behind, and at times reaching his hand forward, the\nfingers prehensile, grasping, as it were, toward the horizon, that\nalways fled before him.\n\nThe sun set upon the third day of McTeague's flight, night came on, the\nstars burned slowly into the cool dark purple of the sky. The gigantic\nsink of white alkali glowed like snow. McTeague, now far into the\ndesert, held steadily on, swinging forward with great strides. His\nenormous strength held him doggedly to his work. Sullenly, with his huge\njaws gripping stolidly together, he pushed on. At midnight he stopped.\n\n\"Now,\" he growled, with a certain desperate defiance, as though he\nexpected to be heard, \"now, I'm going to lay up and get some sleep. You\ncan come or not.\"\n\nHe cleared away the hot surface alkali, spread out his blanket, and\nslept until the next day's heat aroused him. His water was so low that\nhe dared not make coffee now, and so breakfasted without it. Until ten\no'clock he tramped forward, then camped again in the shade of one of\nthe rare rock ledges, and \"lay up\" during the heat of the day. By five\no'clock he was once more on the march.\n\nHe travelled on for the greater part of that night, stopping only once\ntowards three in the morning to water the mule from the canteen. Again\nthe red-hot day burned up over the horizon. Even at six o'clock it was\nhot.\n\n\"It's going to be worse than ever to-day,\" he groaned. \"I wish I could\nfind another rock to camp by. Ain't I ever going to get out of this\nplace?\"\n\nThere was no change in the character of the desert. Always the same\nmeasureless leagues of white-hot alkali stretched away toward the\nhorizon on every hand. Here and there the flat, dazzling surface of the\ndesert broke and raised into long low mounds, from the summit of which\nMcTeague could look for miles and miles over its horrible desolation.\nNo shade was in sight. Not a rock, not a stone broke the monotony of the\nground. Again and again he ascended the low unevennesses, looking and\nsearching for a camping place, shading his eyes from the glitter of sand\nand sky.\n\nHe tramped forward a little farther, then paused at length in a hollow\nbetween two breaks, resolving to make camp there.\n\nSuddenly there was a shout.\n\n\"Hands up. By damn, I got the drop on you!\"\n\nMcTeague looked up.\n\nIt was Marcus.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER 22\n\n\nWithin a month after his departure from San Francisco, Marcus had \"gone\nin on a cattle ranch\" in the Panamint Valley with an Englishman, an\nacquaintance of Mr. Sieppe's. His headquarters were at a place called\nModoc, at the lower extremity of the valley, about fifty miles by trail\nto the south of Keeler.\n\nHis life was the life of a cowboy. He realized his former vision of\nhimself, booted, sombreroed, and revolvered, passing his days in the\nsaddle and the better part of his nights around the poker tables in\nModoc's one saloon. To his intense satisfaction he even involved himself\nin a gun fight that arose over a disputed brand, with the result that\ntwo fingers of his left hand were shot away.\n\nNews from the outside world filtered slowly into the Panamint Valley,\nand the telegraph had never been built beyond Keeler. At intervals one\nof the local papers of Independence, the nearest large town, found its\nway into the cattle camps on the ranges, and occasionally one of the\nSunday editions of a Sacramento journal, weeks old, was passed from hand\nto hand. Marcus ceased to hear from the Sieppes. As for San Francisco,\nit was as far from him as was London or Vienna.\n\nOne day, a fortnight after McTeague's flight from San Francisco, Marcus\nrode into Modoc, to find a group of men gathered about a notice affixed\nto the outside of the Wells-Fargo office. It was an offer of reward for\nthe arrest and apprehension of a murderer. The crime had been committed\nin San Francisco, but the man wanted had been traced as far as the\nwestern portion of Inyo County, and was believed at that time to be in\nhiding in either the Pinto or Panamint hills, in the vicinity of Keeler.\n\nMarcus reached Keeler on the afternoon of that same day. Half a mile\nfrom the town his pony fell and died from exhaustion. Marcus did not\nstop even to remove the saddle. He arrived in the barroom of the hotel\nin Keeler just after the posse had been made up. The sheriff, who had\ncome down from Independence that morning, at first refused his offer of\nassistance. He had enough men already--too many, in fact. The country\ntravelled through would be hard, and it would be difficult to find water\nfor so many men and horses.\n\n\"But none of you fellers have ever seen um,\" vociferated Marcus,\nquivering with excitement and wrath. \"I know um well. I could pick\num out in a million. I can identify um, and you fellers can't. And I\nknew--I knew--good GOD! I knew that girl--his wife--in Frisco. She's\na cousin of mine, she is--she was--I thought once of--This thing's a\npersonal matter of mine--an' that money he got away with, that five\nthousand, belongs to me by rights. Oh, never mind, I'm going along. Do\nyou hear?\" he shouted, his fists raised, \"I'm going along, I tell you.\nThere ain't a man of you big enough to stop me. Let's see you try\nand stop me going. Let's see you once, any two of you.\" He filled the\nbarroom with his clamor.\n\n\"Lord love you, come along, then,\" said the sheriff.\n\nThe posse rode out of Keeler that same night. The keeper of the general\nmerchandise store, from whom Marcus had borrowed a second pony, had\ninformed them that Cribbens and his partner, whose description tallied\nexactly with that given in the notice of reward, had outfitted at\nhis place with a view to prospecting in the Panamint hills. The posse\ntrailed them at once to their first camp at the head of the valley. It\nwas an easy matter. It was only necessary to inquire of the cowboys and\nrange riders of the valley if they had seen and noted the passage of two\nmen, one of whom carried a bird cage.\n\nBeyond this first camp the trail was lost, and a week was wasted in\na bootless search around the mine at Gold Gulch, whither it seemed\nprobable the partners had gone. Then a travelling peddler, who included\nGold Gulch in his route, brought in the news of a wonderful strike of\ngold-bearing quartz some ten miles to the south on the western slope of\nthe range. Two men from Keeler had made a strike, the peddler had said,\nand added the curious detail that one of the men had a canary bird in a\ncage with him.\n\nThe posse made Cribbens's camp three days after the unaccountable\ndisappearance of his partner. Their man was gone, but the narrow hoof\nprints of a mule, mixed with those of huge hob-nailed boots, could be\nplainly followed in the sand. Here they picked up the trail and held\nto it steadily till the point was reached where, instead of tending\nsouthward it swerved abruptly to the east. The men could hardly believe\ntheir eyes.\n\n\"It ain't reason,\" exclaimed the sheriff. \"What in thunder is he up to?\nThis beats me. Cutting out into Death Valley at this time of year.\"\n\n\"He's heading for Gold Mountain over in the Armagosa, sure.\"\n\nThe men decided that this conjecture was true. It was the only inhabited\nlocality in that direction. A discussion began as to the further\nmovements of the posse.\n\n\"I don't figure on going into that alkali sink with no eight men and\nhorses,\" declared the sheriff. \"One man can't carry enough water to take\nhim and his mount across, let alone EIGHT. No, sir. Four couldn't do\nit. No, THREE couldn't. We've got to make a circuit round the valley and\ncome up on the other side and head him off at Gold Mountain. That's what\nwe got to do, and ride like hell to do it, too.\"\n\nBut Marcus protested with all the strength of his lungs against\nabandoning the trail now that they had found it. He argued that they\nwere but a day and a half behind their man now. There was no possibility\nof their missing the trail--as distinct in the white alkali as in snow.\nThey could make a dash into the valley, secure their man, and return\nlong before their water failed them. He, for one, would not give up the\npursuit, now that they were so close. In the haste of the departure\nfrom Keeler the sheriff had neglected to swear him in. He was under no\norders. He would do as he pleased.\n\n\"Go on, then, you darn fool,\" answered the sheriff. \"We'll cut on round\nthe valley, for all that. It's a gamble he'll be at Gold Mountain before\nyou're half way across. But if you catch him, here\"--he tossed Marcus a\npair of handcuffs--\"put 'em on him and bring him back to Keeler.\"\n\nTwo days after he had left the posse, and when he was already far out\nin the desert, Marcus's horse gave out. In the fury of his impatience he\nhad spurred mercilessly forward on the trail, and on the morning of the\nthird day found that his horse was unable to move. The joints of his\nlegs seemed locked rigidly. He would go his own length, stumbling and\ninterfering, then collapse helplessly upon the ground with a pitiful\ngroan. He was used up.\n\nMarcus believed himself to be close upon McTeague now. The ashes at his\nlast camp had still been smoldering. Marcus took what supplies of food\nand water he could carry, and hurried on. But McTeague was farther ahead\nthan he had guessed, and by evening of his third day upon the desert\nMarcus, raging with thirst, had drunk his last mouthful of water and had\nflung away the empty canteen.\n\n\"If he ain't got water with um,\" he said to himself as he pushed on, \"If\nhe ain't got water with um, by damn! I'll be in a bad way. I will, for a\nfact.\"\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nAt Marcus's shout McTeague looked up and around him. For the instant\nhe saw no one. The white glare of alkali was still unbroken. Then his\nswiftly rolling eyes lighted upon a head and shoulder that protruded\nabove the low crest of the break directly in front of him. A man\nwas there, lying at full length upon the ground, covering him with\na revolver. For a few seconds McTeague looked at the man stupidly,\nbewildered, confused, as yet without definite thought. Then he noticed\nthat the man was singularly like Marcus Schouler. It WAS Marcus\nSchouler. How in the world did Marcus Schouler come to be in that\ndesert? What did he mean by pointing a pistol at him that way? He'd\nbest look out or the pistol would go off. Then his thoughts readjusted\nthemselves with a swiftness born of a vivid sense of danger. Here was\nthe enemy at last, the tracker he had felt upon his footsteps. Now\nat length he had \"come on\" and shown himself, after all those days of\nskulking. McTeague was glad of it. He'd show him now. They two would\nhave it out right then and there. His rifle! He had thrown it away long\nsince. He was helpless. Marcus had ordered him to put up his hands.\nIf he did not, Marcus would kill him. He had the drop on him. McTeague\nstared, scowling fiercely at the levelled pistol. He did not move.\n\n\"Hands up!\" shouted Marcus a second time. \"I'll give you three to do it\nin. One, two----\"\n\nInstinctively McTeague put his hands above his head.\n\nMarcus rose and came towards him over the break.\n\n\"Keep 'em up,\" he cried. \"If you move 'em once I'll kill you, sure.\"\n\nHe came up to McTeague and searched him, going through his pockets; but\nMcTeague had no revolver; not even a hunting knife.\n\n\"What did you do with that money, with that five thousand dollars?\"\n\n\"It's on the mule,\" answered McTeague, sullenly.\n\nMarcus grunted, and cast a glance at the mule, who was standing some\ndistance away, snorting nervously, and from time to time flattening his\nlong ears.\n\n\"Is that it there on the horn of the saddle, there in that canvas sack?\"\nMarcus demanded.\n\n\"Yes, that's it.\"\n\nA gleam of satisfaction came into Marcus's eyes, and under his breath he\nmuttered:\n\n\"Got it at last.\"\n\nHe was singularly puzzled to know what next to do. He had got McTeague.\nThere he stood at length, with his big hands over his head, scowling at\nhim sullenly. Marcus had caught his enemy, had run down the man for whom\nevery officer in the State had been looking. What should he do with him\nnow? He couldn't keep him standing there forever with his hands over his\nhead.\n\n\"Got any water?\" he demanded.\n\n\"There's a canteen of water on the mule.\"\n\nMarcus moved toward the mule and made as if to reach the bridle-rein.\nThe mule squealed, threw up his head, and galloped to a little distance,\nrolling his eyes and flattening his ears.\n\nMarcus swore wrathfully.\n\n\"He acted that way once before,\" explained McTeague, his hands still in\nthe air. \"He ate some loco-weed back in the hills before I started.\"\n\nFor a moment Marcus hesitated. While he was catching the mule McTeague\nmight get away. But where to, in heaven's name? A rat could not hide on\nthe surface of that glistening alkali, and besides, all McTeague's store\nof provisions and his priceless supply of water were on the mule. Marcus\nran after the mule, revolver in hand, shouting and cursing. But the mule\nwould not be caught. He acted as if possessed, squealing, lashing out,\nand galloping in wide circles, his head high in the air.\n\n\"Come on,\" shouted Marcus, furious, turning back to McTeague. \"Come on,\nhelp me catch him. We got to catch him. All the water we got is on the\nsaddle.\"\n\nMcTeague came up.\n\n\"He's eatun some loco-weed,\" he repeated. \"He went kinda crazy once\nbefore.\"\n\n\"If he should take it into his head to bolt and keep on running----\"\n\nMarcus did not finish. A sudden great fear seemed to widen around and\ninclose the two men. Once their water gone, the end would not be long.\n\n\"We can catch him all right,\" said the dentist. \"I caught him once\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Oh, I guess we can catch him,\" answered Marcus, reassuringly.\n\nAlready the sense of enmity between the two had weakened in the face of\na common peril. Marcus let down the hammer of his revolver and slid it\nback into the holster.\n\nThe mule was trotting on ahead, snorting and throwing up great clouds of\nalkali dust. At every step the canvas sack jingled, and McTeague's bird\ncage, still wrapped in the flour-bags, bumped against the saddlepads. By\nand by the mule stopped, blowing out his nostrils excitedly.\n\n\"He's clean crazy,\" fumed Marcus, panting and swearing.\n\n\"We ought to come up on him quiet,\" observed McTeague.\n\n\"I'll try and sneak up,\" said Marcus; \"two of us would scare him again.\nYou stay here.\"\n\nMarcus went forward a step at a time. He was almost within arm's length\nof the bridle when the mule shied from him abruptly and galloped away.\n\nMarcus danced with rage, shaking his fists, and swearing horribly. Some\nhundred yards away the mule paused and began blowing and snuffing in the\nalkali as though in search of feed. Then, for no reason, he shied again,\nand started off on a jog trot toward the east.\n\n\"We've GOT to follow him,\" exclaimed Marcus as McTeague came up.\n\"There's no water within seventy miles of here.\"\n\nThen began an interminable pursuit. Mile after mile, under the terrible\nheat of the desert sun, the two men followed the mule, racked with a\nthirst that grew fiercer every hour. A dozen times they could almost\ntouch the canteen of water, and as often the distraught animal shied\naway and fled before them. At length Marcus cried:\n\n\"It's no use, we can't catch him, and we're killing ourselves with\nthirst. We got to take our chances.\" He drew his revolver from its\nholster, cocked it, and crept forward.\n\n\"Steady, now,\" said McTeague; \"it won' do to shoot through the canteen.\"\n\nWithin twenty yards Marcus paused, made a rest of his left forearm and\nfired.\n\n\"You GOT him,\" cried McTeague. \"No, he's up again. Shoot him again. He's\ngoing to bolt.\"\n\nMarcus ran on, firing as he ran. The mule, one foreleg trailing,\nscrambled along, squealing and snorting. Marcus fired his last shot. The\nmule pitched forward upon his head, then, rolling sideways, fell upon\nthe canteen, bursting it open and spilling its entire contents into the\nsand.\n\nMarcus and McTeague ran up, and Marcus snatched the battered canteen\nfrom under the reeking, bloody hide. There was no water left. Marcus\nflung the canteen from him and stood up, facing McTeague. There was a\npause.\n\n\"We're dead men,\" said Marcus.\n\nMcTeague looked from him out over the desert. Chaotic desolation\nstretched from them on either hand, flaming and glaring with the\nafternoon heat. There was the brazen sky and the leagues upon leagues of\nalkali, leper white. There was nothing more. They were in the heart of\nDeath Valley.\n\n\"Not a drop of water,\" muttered McTeague; \"not a drop of water.\"\n\n\"We can drink the mule's blood,\" said Marcus. \"It's been done before.\nBut--but--\" he looked down at the quivering, gory body--\"but I ain't\nthirsty enough for that yet.\"\n\n\"Where's the nearest water?\"\n\n\"Well, it's about a hundred miles or more back of us in the Panamint\nhills,\" returned Marcus, doggedly. \"We'd be crazy long before we reached\nit. I tell you, we're done for, by damn, we're DONE for. We ain't ever\ngoing to get outa here.\"\n\n\"Done for?\" murmured the other, looking about stupidly. \"Done for,\nthat's the word. Done for? Yes, I guess we're done for.\"\n\n\"What are we going to do NOW?\" exclaimed Marcus, sharply, after a while.\n\n\"Well, let's--let's be moving along--somewhere.\"\n\n\"WHERE, I'd like to know? What's the good of moving on?\"\n\n\"What's the good of stopping here?\"\n\nThere was a silence.\n\n\"Lord, it's hot,\" said the dentist, finally, wiping his forehead with\nthe back of his hand. Marcus ground his teeth.\n\n\"Done for,\" he muttered; \"done for.\"\n\n\"I never WAS so thirsty,\" continued McTeague. \"I'm that dry I can hear\nmy tongue rubbing against the roof of my mouth.\"\n\n\"Well, we can't stop here,\" said Marcus, finally; \"we got to go\nsomewhere. We'll try and get back, but it ain't no manner of use.\nAnything we want to take along with us from the mule? We can----\"\n\nSuddenly he paused. In an instant the eyes of the two doomed men had met\nas the same thought simultaneously rose in their minds. The canvas sack\nwith its five thousand dollars was still tied to the horn of the saddle.\n\nMarcus had emptied his revolver at the mule, and though he still wore\nhis cartridge belt, he was for the moment as unarmed as McTeague.\n\n\"I guess,\" began McTeague coming forward a step, \"I guess, even if we\nare done for, I'll take--some of my truck along.\"\n\n\"Hold on,\" exclaimed Marcus, with rising aggressiveness. \"Let's talk\nabout that. I ain't so sure about who that--who that money belongs to.\"\n\n\"Well, I AM, you see,\" growled the dentist.\n\nThe old enmity between the two men, their ancient hate, was flaming up\nagain.\n\n\"Don't try an' load that gun either,\" cried McTeague, fixing Marcus with\nhis little eyes.\n\n\"Then don't lay your finger on that sack,\" shouted the other. \"You're my\nprisoner, do you understand? You'll do as I say.\" Marcus had drawn the\nhandcuffs from his pocket, and stood ready with his revolver held as\na club. \"You soldiered me out of that money once, and played me for a\nsucker, an' it's my turn now. Don't you lay your finger on that sack.\"\n\nMarcus barred McTeague's way, white with passion. McTeague did not\nanswer. His eyes drew to two fine, twinkling points, and his enormous\nhands knotted themselves into fists, hard as wooden mallets. He moved a\nstep nearer to Marcus, then another.\n\nSuddenly the men grappled, and in another instant were rolling and\nstruggling upon the hot white ground. McTeague thrust Marcus backward\nuntil he tripped and fell over the body of the dead mule. The little\nbird cage broke from the saddle with the violence of their fall, and\nrolled out upon the ground, the flour-bags slipping from it. McTeague\ntore the revolver from Marcus's grip and struck out with it blindly.\nClouds of alkali dust, fine and pungent, enveloped the two fighting men,\nall but strangling them.\n\nMcTeague did not know how he killed his enemy, but all at once Marcus\ngrew still beneath his blows. Then there was a sudden last return of\nenergy. McTeague's right wrist was caught, something licked upon it,\nthen the struggling body fell limp and motionless with a long breath.\n\nAs McTeague rose to his feet, he felt a pull at his right wrist;\nsomething held it fast. Looking down, he saw that Marcus in that last\nstruggle had found strength to handcuff their wrists together. Marcus\nwas dead now; McTeague was locked to the body. All about him, vast\ninterminable, stretched the measureless leagues of Death Valley.\n\nMcTeague remained stupidly looking around him, now at the distant\nhorizon, now at the ground, now at the half-dead canary chittering\nfeebly in its little gilt prison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of McTeague, by Frank Norris\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MCTEAGUE ***\n\n***** This file should be named 165-8.txt or 165-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/1\/6\/165\/\n\nProduced by Pauline J.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1248,"split":"test"}
