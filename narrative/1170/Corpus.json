{"ori_id":"2daf99dd0a17e8141b6697c4dad2621082cf5488","title":"Fletch (film)","context":"Fletch (film)\n Los Angeles Times reporter Irwin \"Fletch\" Fletcher (Chase) is writing an article exposing drug trafficking on the beaches of Los Angeles. Posing as an addict during his investigation, he is approached by Boyd Aviation executive vice president Alan Stanwyk (Matheson) who mistakenly assumes Fletch is a junkie. Stanwyk claims to have bone cancer, with only months left to live, and wishes to avoid the pain and suffering. Stanwyk offers $50,000 for Fletch to come to his mansion in a few days time, kill him, and then escape to Rio de Janeiro, staging the murder to look like a burglary.\nFletch, while not completely convinced on the truth of Stanwyk's story, reluctantly agrees to the plan. Along with his colleague Larry (Davis), he begins investigating Stanwyk instead of completing his drug trafficking expos\u0102\u0160, much to the disapproval of his overbearing editor Frank Walker (Libertini). Disguised as a doctor, Fletch accesses Stanwyk's file at the hospital and learns Stanwyk lied about having cancer.\nFletch visits Stanwyk's wife Gail (Wheeler-Nicholson) at her tennis club. Pretending to be a tennis instructor and friend of Alan's, he flirts with her during an impromptu tennis lesson. Looking into Stanwyk's finances, Fletch finds that Gail recently converted $3 million of her personal stock in Boyd Aviation into cash for her husband, to buy a ranch in Provo, Utah. Fletch breaks into the realtor's office and discovers the deed lists the sale price as only $3,000.\nMeanwhile, LAPD Chief Jerry Karlin (Baker) learns of Fletch's drug article. He warns Fletch that the article will jeopardize his undercover operation on the beach. Karlin threatens to kill Fletch unless he agrees to drop the investigation. At the tennis club, Fletch overhears an arrogant club member, Mr. Underhill, insulting a waiter and decides to use Underhill's tab to treat Gail to an expensive lunch in her private cabana. Fletch reveals Alan's murder scheme to her and tells her the true price of the ranch.\nFletch watches Stanwyk making a suspicious briefcase exchange with Chief Karlin, but is unable to determine the nature of their relationship. He returns home to find LAPD officers lying in wait at his apartment. He flees, but is pursued in a harrowing car chase. Forced to go into hiding, Fletch returns to Provo. Posing as an insurance investigator, he interviews Stanwyk's parents. Fletch discovers Stanwyk has been secretly married to another woman for eight years; his bigamous marriage to Gail allowed him access to her personal wealth.\nFletch arrives at Stanwyk's mansion on the night of the planned murder, but finds Stanwyk prepared to kill him instead. Fletch reveals his discovery of Stanwyk's real plan: to fake his own death by killing Fletch and burning his body beyond recognition, then escape to Brazil with his first wife and Gail's $3 million. Stanwyk was also using his private jet to smuggle cocaine from South America to supply Chief Karlin, who blackmailed ex-convicts to peddle it on the beaches. Karlin arrives unexpectedly; learning of Stanwyk's intention to flee with $800,000 of the Chief's drug money, he kills Stanwyk. Karlin and Fletch fight over the gun until Gail strikes Karlin from behind, rendering him unconscious.\nKarlin is indicted with Fletch's testimony. Fletch begins dating Gail and, in the final scene, takes her on a vacation to Rio, again using Mr. Underhill's tab.\n<html>\n<head><title>Fletch Script at IMSDb.<\/title>\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"Fletch script at the Internet Movie Script Database.\">\n<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"Fletch script, Fletch movie script, Fletch film script\">\n<meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\" \/>\n<meta name=\"HandheldFriendly\" content=\"true\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\" content=\"text\/html; charset=iso-8859-1\">\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Language\" content=\"EN\">\n\n<meta name=objecttype CONTENT=Document>\n<meta name=ROBOTS CONTENT=\"INDEX, FOLLOW\">\n<meta name=Subject CONTENT=\"Movie scripts, Film scripts\">\n<meta name=rating CONTENT=General>\n<meta name=distribution content=Global>\n<meta name=revisit-after CONTENT=\"2 days\">\n\n<link href=\"\/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\">\n\n<script type=\"text\/javascript\">\n  var _gaq = _gaq || [];\n  _gaq.push(['_setAccount', 'UA-3785444-3']);\n  _gaq.push(['_trackPageview']);\n\n  (function() {\n    var ga = document.createElement('script'); ga.type = 'text\/javascript'; ga.async = true;\n    ga.src = ('https:' == document.location.protocol ?

DOCTOR'S\nEXAMINING ROOM - DAY<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch, stripped to\nthe waist. is being examined by Dr. Joseph Dolen, a rather\nimperious physician.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nSo where do you know Alan from?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWe play tennis at the club.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nReally. The California Racquet Club?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nYes.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nThat's my club too. I haven't seen you there.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWell, I haven't played in a while because of\nthese kidney pains.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nRight, and how long have you had these\npains, Mr. Barber?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThat's <u>Babar.<\/u><\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nTwo bs?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nOne. B-a-b-a-r.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nThat's two.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nBut not right next to each other. I thought\nthat's what you meant.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nArnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about\nan elephant named Babar?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI don't know. I don't have any.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nNo children?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nNo books. No elephants either. No\nreally good elephant books.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\n(eyes Fletch curiously)\nStill, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing\nit on the club registry.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch's eyes drift\nto Dolen's side table with its unnerving assortment of medical\nparaphernalia.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nOh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nYour aunt?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nMrs. Smith.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nJoan or Margaret Smith.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nRight.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nWell, which one?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nMargaret.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nFunny old bird.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nIs she ever. I've got some stories....<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nI'll bet. Shame about Ed.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(vamping)\nIt was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nOh, he was dying for years.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nSure, but the end was so sudden.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nHe was in intensive care for eight weeks.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nYes, but the <u>very<\/u> end, when he actually died,\nthat was extremely sudden.\n(quickly)\nYou know, Alan and I were recently speaking of\ndying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of \ninsurance on him. You must have to be in some kind\nof perfect health to get that kind of policy.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nBend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nOh really, there's no need to -- \nwe don't want to do that....<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nJust relax....<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nHonest, I feel fine. You better be married.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch looks alarmed\nas Dolan pushes him into position. Dolan puts on a plastic glove.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">53 CLOSE - FLETCH<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nDid I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I\nshould see an ear dahhh --\n(as Dolan starts to probe from behind)\nEver serve time?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nBreathe easy....<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nAnyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily.\nI know there's a history of cancer in the family.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\n(noncommittally)\nThere is?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWhoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nJust relax.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(reacts to a poke)\nGee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately.\nIs he all right?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nI can't discuss another patient. You know that.\n(rising into frame and washing up)\nWell, I can't find anything wrong with you.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe\nI should get a real complete physical. You give\nAlan an annual, don't you?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nYeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days,\nrun lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull \nyour pants up now.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">DR. DOLEN\nTell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll\nmake all the arrangements.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date.\nOr an elephant.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">54 INT. HOSPITAL\nRECEPTION AREA - DAY<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch is dressed in\nshorts, a clean shirt, and is carrying a doctor's bag. He is\nwearing a stethoscope around his neck , has a beeper on, a lot of\npencils and other doctor gadgets. He's standing at the directory<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">55 DIRECTORY<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Combing it with his\neyes, he sees the directory:<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">PATHOLOGY - THIRD\n<b>FLOOR\n<\/b><b>B. ROSENSTIEN, M.D.\n<\/b><b>H. ROSENBLATT, M.D.\n<\/b>P. ROSENWOHL, M.D.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch goes to a door\nmarked &quot;Stairs.&quot;<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">56 INT. STAIRWELL -\nDAY<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch abruptly\nempties his doctor's bag and puts on a long green gown, a cap and\na face mask. He plugs the stethoscope in his ears, removes\nmiscellaneous file folders filled with papers, closes the bag,\nand heads for Pathology.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">57 INT PATHOLOGY\nDEPARTMENT - DAY<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">It's at the end of a\nlong hall, and adjacent to the Autopsy Room and the Pathology\nRecords Room. Over his shoulder we can see into the autopsy room\nwhere a gowned doctor is happily performing an autopsy.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\n(to Fletch)\nIdentification please.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch hastily\nfumbles through his wallet, deftly dropping and picking up the\npapers he has brought with him.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nIt's me doctor Rosenpenis. I just have to take\nanother peek at Alan Stanwyk's file. What have \nthey done with this place?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\n(confused at all his activity)\nNothing. They're still there.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nRight. Fine.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Still dropping and\npicking up, shuffling and collating, Fletch starts toward the\nFiles Room, when the doctor performing the autopsy yells at him.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">PATHOLOGIST\nHey you!<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch stiffens and\nturns around.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">PATHOLOGIST\nGive me a hand for a second would you doctor?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch hesitates.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">PATHOLOGIST\nCome on, come on.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Reluctantly, he goes\nto the autopsy table, and the cadaver thereon, which is covered\nby a sheet, except for the mid-section.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">58 TWO SHOT -\nFLETCH AND PATHOLOGIST<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">(Note: from here on\nwe never see the body.)<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">PATHOLOGIST\n(poking around)\nHave you ever see a spleen this large?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(trying not to look)\nNot recently.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">PATHOLOGIST\nGrab this, will you?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nUh, I'm not really prepared. My hands aren't sterilized.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">PATHOLOGIST\nYou're not going to make this guy any sicker.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">We hear a squishing\nnoise as he grabs something large and wet and plops it into\nFletch's hand. Fletch stands there holding something icky out of\nframe, looking uncomfortably up at the ceiling, the floor,\nanywhere but at the cadaver or at the stuff in his hand.\nMeanwhile, we hear sounds of further incisions, and the deflating\nof an organ.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">PATHOLOGIST\nYou never really get used to the smell, do you?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch's eyes roll\nup, and he falls to the floor in a dead faint.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">59 INT. RECORDS\nROOM - DAY - MINUTES LATER<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch is on a couch,\nbeginning to regain consciousness. The Records Nurse hovers over\nhim.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\nAre you all right, Doctor?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWhere am I?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\nYou're in the Records Room.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI'm fine.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\nCan I get you something?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nHave you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\nDoctor Holmes went to get you some smelling salts. \nHe was quite surprised that you fainted.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWell, I didn't want to say anything, but I thought\nthe dead man was my brother.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\nOh my God!<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nIt's all right. It wasn't him but\nthat spleen was a splitting image.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He sits up and sees\nthat just outside the glass is none other that Dr. Joseph Dolen,\ntalking with the pathologist.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nOh, God, I think I'm about to hyperventilate.\nHave you got a paper bag, or something.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\nYes, right away.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">She goes to get the\npaper bag, and Fletch turns his back on Dr. Dolen to go through\nthe file cabinet. By the time the Nurse returns, he's got\nStanwyk's file.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\nHere you are, Doctor.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThank you.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He puts the bag over\nhis mouth and breathes deeply as he continues the conversation\nwith her. (From time to time, we see Dr. Dolen in the b.g.\nlooking over, but does not come into the records room or question\nwhat's happening).<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\nIs there anything particular you're looking for?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nMy associates did a biopsy on this man recently.\n(thumbs through file)\nHe's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma,\nsome kind of noma. Hmmm. I can't seem to find any record\nof it.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\n(taking the file)\nWell, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.\n(searches)\nWait. Here it is. Yep. Surgical removal of two moles.\nTissue was benign.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThat's it?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\n(shows him the file)\nThat's it.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(reading it)\nThis was last month. So Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">RECORDS NURSE\nI guess not.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(very puzzled)\nHe'll be so relieved.<\/p>\n\n\n<p align=\"left\">60 EXT. SANTA MONICA\nSTREET - LATE AFTERNOON<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch pulls up in\nfront of his building, a 1970's cinderblock apartment complex.\nFletch parks his car halfway up the curb, gets out and spots a\nMercedes coupe. He starts running toward the rear of his\nbuilding.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">61 EXT. REAR OF THE\nBUILDING - DAY<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch starts\nclimbing up the fire escape of his building.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">62 FIRE ESCAPE - DAY<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch reaches the\nsecond floor. He's huffing and puffing.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nChrist.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">63 REVERSE<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Attorney Charles\nGillett is waiting for him on the second floor fire escape.\nGillett smiles.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nRefusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, Fletch.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">64 MASTER<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWhat about breaking and entering?\n(points to Gillett's coat)\nAre you wearing anything under that?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nI did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable\nlocation to await my client's delinquent husband.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step\ninside.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch takes out a\ncredit card and jimmies open the lock on the window.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">65 INT. FLETCH'S\nAPARTMENT - DAY<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch climbs in\nthrough the window, followed by Gillett. His small apartment is\njust barely furnished. A low basketball hoop is attached to the\nwall. Fletch takes a ball, offers it to Gillett.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nOne on one?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Gillett shakes his\nhead. Fletch does a reverse shot and misses, sending a plastic\nglobe lamb crashing to the floor.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nAnd the foul.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch takes a\nsecond, successful shot.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nYou owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(still playing b-ball)\nShe doesn't need the money, for crissakes. \nShe's living with Monty. I know it.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nI don't know what you're referring to. \nWendy maintains her own residence.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nIt stinks. I thought woman were independent now.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nUntil she remarries, Fletch.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nHey, shut up, okay? I just hate this.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nI empathize with your plight, Fletch. However,\nyou threw her out.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nShe was sleeping with everybody. The cable TV\nguy. You can't get lower than that....<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nYou should have proved that in a court of law.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nMy lawyer was a bum.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\n(smiles)\nI agree.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch puts down the\nbasketball, picks up a stack of mail and rifles through it.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nYou may be right.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nAre you serious?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\n(shrugs)\nThat's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred\nand eighteen dollars.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWait a minute! Our problems might be solved.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch holds up an\nenvelope with Ed McMahon's picture on it.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(continuing)\nI think I just won a million dollars!<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He opens it and looks\ninside, feigning disappointment.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(continuing)\nDamn...lost again. Sorry.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nThis is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made,\nwe're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch sighs, takes\nout the envelope given to him by Stanwyk. He hands a thousand\ndollars to Gillett.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nCash. I'm impressed.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nFound it in a cab. That's a grand.\nApply the difference to next month.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GILLETT\nTill then.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Gillett smiles and\nexits.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">66 KITCHEN - DAY<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch opens the\nfridge. Inside are tow six-packs of Coors, a jar of Miracle Whip,\na half a cucumber, and a brown head of lettuce. Fletch takes a\nbeer and slams the door shut with such force that we hear\nbreakage inside.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">67 MASTER - APARTMENT\n- DAY<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">In a foul mood,\nFletch leaves the kitchen, and wanders into the living room. It\nhas the personality of an Abbey Rents.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He picks up the TV\nremote control. The television clicks on. Chick Hearn is with\nJabbar, during a Laker pregame warmup.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThank God.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch settles back.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">68 TELEVISION<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Hearn is gushing over\nJabbar.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">69 FLETCH<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He watches\ncontemplatively. He is bone tired.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">70 TELIVISION<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">HEARN\nHow about Fletch?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">JABBAR\nWell, Fletch has been great. He's super-strong,\nreally clogs the middle for us, boxes out, \ngets the bounds....<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">71 FLETCH<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He smiles and nods,\ndeep in fantasy.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">72 TELEVISION<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">HEARN\nNow here's a key play in Tuesday night's game....<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Hearn and Jabbar look\ndown at a television monitor.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">73 FLETCH<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He's half asleep.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">JABBAR (V.O.)\nHere I am dishing off to Fletch....<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch raises an\neyebrow.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">74 TELEVISION<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">There's Fletch, his\nhair in an Afro, dressed in Laker gold. He's on the receiving end\nof a Jabbar pass, making an easy layup.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">HEARN (V.O.)\nGosh, he makes it look so easy!<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">75 FLETCH<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">asleep, smiling.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">77 PRICATICE COURT -\nDAY<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Gail Stanwyk is on\nthe other side of the net, loading tennis balls into the\nautomatic serve machine. She is in her late twenties and quite\nattractive., but in a much more natural way than other women we\nsee here. She is good natured and effervescent. Fletch steps up\nto the entrance of the court.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nGail Stanwyk!<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">She looks up. He\nenters the court with great delight.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(continuing)\nI haven't seen you since the wedding,\nJeez, you look great.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\n(genuinely pleased)\nI do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess\nsomething to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding.\nI really don't have the faintest idea who you are.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nHuh? No, not my wedding. Yours.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\nOh, mine! Thank God.\n(furrows her brow)\nActually, that doesn't make it any better, does it?\nAre you a friend of Alan's?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWe used to fly together. I'm...John.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\n(snaps her fingers in happy recognition)\nJohn! You used to fly together!<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Her smile segues\nright into an &quot;I'm sorry, bit I give up&quot; expression.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\nJohn who?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nJohn Ultrarelamensky.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\n(bursts out in laughter)\nOh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nIt's Scotch-Rumanian.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\n(still loading tennis balls)\nThat's a strange combination.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nSo were my parents.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\nMind if I keep practicing? I need to work\non my ground stroke a little.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nPlease.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">As Mrs. Stanwyk\ncrosses to the other side of the net, a waiter approaches Fletch.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">WAITER\nExcuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nYes, I'm with the Underhills.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">WAITER\nThey just left, sir.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThey'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">WAITER\nWould you care for a drink while you're waiting?\nI can put it on the Underhill bill.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nGreat. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">WAITER\nVery good sir.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">The Waiter leaves,\nand Fletch watches as Mrs. Stanwyk tries to return the serving\nmachine's serves. She swings so goofily that she can't even get\nthe racket on the ball. She has clearly never taken a lesson in\nher life, and it is doubtful if she will ever make contact with a\ntennis ball in this century.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\nDamn, I thought I had that one.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nYou should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\nWhat are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him.\nAnd he's been so preoccupied.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nPreoccupied with what?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS.

When she's almost up to him, she turns back to the\nserving machine and points a finger at it, as if addressing a pet\ndog.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS STANWYK\nStay!\n(to Fletch)\nI must be having an off day.

SWARTHOUT\nREALTY - NIGHT<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch stops his car\nin front of the ranch-style house. A lighted sign in the yard\nindicate that this is indeed Swarthout Realty, but the house is\ndark; no one appears to be home. Somewhere in the yard a dog\nbarks viciously, frantically.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">116 DOG<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">A killer Doberman is\ntied up behind a chain link fence. At the sight of the intruding\nFletch, the dog's lip is practically over his nose, his fangs are\npoised and gleaming.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">117 FLETCH<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(getting out of his car)\nWhat's your name fella?

He rings the bell. The dog yowls\neven louder. Fletch waits. And waits. He rings again. Satisfied\nthat no one is home, he tries the front door. Of course, it is\nlocked. He takes out a credit card, starts to jimmy the lock, and\nactually seems to be making progress when his credit card snaps\nin half.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nSh*t.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He pockets the broken\ncredit card, steps back and looks over the house for another\npossible point of entry.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">120 FLETCH'S POINT OF\nVIEW - AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Double-hung. Slightly\nwarped, so that the upper half does not exactly true with the\nlower half.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">121 FLETCH<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">looks around to see\nhow to climb up to it.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">122 MASTER<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">There's only one way.\nClimb up the side of the chain link fence which separates him\nfrom the murderous dog. Fletch approaches it warily. The dog is\npractically foaming. Fletch reaches out a hand to get a hold of\nthe fence, and the dog just about rips the fence apart.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(in his best Barbara Woodhouse)\nSit-tuh!<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">This has no effect,\nso Fletch backs up a few yards, take a deep breath for courage\nand makes a headlong running start for the fence, using his\nmomentum to get to the top before the dog eats him. He grabs hold\nand scrambles wildly for the top. He makes it.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nRoll over. Play dead. Good boy.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch now grabs hold\nof the eave on the side of the house, and very carefully pulls\nhimself onto it. It's only about ten feet from there to the\nvulnerable window, but the angle of the eave is rather steep, and\nthe going is treacherous. As he makes his way, he keeps a wary\neye on the dog who keeps leaping up, seemingly getting closer and\ncloser to taking a giant bite out of Fletch's backside.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nYou any relation to Doctor Dolan?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">Now he's at the\nwindow. He tries to open it, but despite it's warped appearance\nfrom the ground, it is locked. Fletch looks at the lock and can't\nbelieve it. He sighs. He shakes his head. He smashes the window\nwith his elbow.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI hate this.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He climbs into the\ndarkened house, leaving the enraged dog to run furiously around\nthe fenced in yard that surrounds the house.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">123 INT SWARTHOUT'S\nHOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch tiptoes though\nthe upstairs bedroom and down the stairs.

He pulls it. He\nthumbs through various documents until he finds what he's looking\nfor. A copy of a deed.

Then he props the deed up on top of the file\ncabinet, and moves a lamp into position to light it. Just as he\nsnaps his first shot, we hear a terrible crashing sound.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">127 WINDOW<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">The murderous\nDoberman has made a crashing leap right through the den window,\nsending glass flying everywhere, and he streaks across the room\nto rip Fletch into bite-sized shreds.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">128 MASTER<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch bolts and the\ndog flies into the file cabinet, knocking it over, scattering all\nthe files over the floor. Fletch dashes for the nearest door, and\nruns through it just as the dog slams into it.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">129 INT. KITCHEN<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch is now holed\nup in the kitchen, panting to catch his breath, feeling the full\ncourse of adrenaline pumping through his terrified veins. He sees\nthat he can get to his car by climbing through the window. But in\norder to get to the window he has to let go of the door, and that\nwould allow the dog to get in.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Looking around\nfrantically, holding the door shut against the furious slamming\nof the dog, he reaches for and finally grabs a mop which he props\nunder the door knob, thus keeping the door shut. Letting go of\nthe door gingerly, he satisfies himself that the dog cannot get\nin, and he makes his break for the window.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He vaults up onto the\ncounter top and is just about to break the window when he sees\nthat the dog's continued efforts are about to result in opening\nthe door.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch knows he has\nonly seconds. Standing on top of the counter, he opens the door\nof the restaurant-sized refrigerator next to him, and just as the\nsnarling dog bursts into the room Fletch starts hurling food at\nit. A pot roast, sliced turkey with stuffing, a couple of filet\nmignons. The dog is momentarily distracted. Fletch pours a large\nbucket of cranberry sauce on the dog.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nSuck on this Cujo!<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Then he dumps an\nequally large bucket of mashed potatoes.

That makes my job harder.\nAnd if you print your story this week, you might get \nsome of my men killed. I can't let that happen, Mr. Fletch.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He throws Fletch\nagainst the wall of celebrity photos, some of which fall to the\nfloor.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nYou go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll\nmake you regret it.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(picks up a picture)\nHey, you and Tommy Lasorda.

Self-defense. We don't do this\nvery much anymore...but we have.

Fletch's car follows, several\ndiscreet car lengths behind.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">168 INT.

He gets out of his car and opens the\ntrunk.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">170 FLETCH<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He pulls into a\nfast-food joint on the west side of the street.

Terrific.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch cuts through\nthe parking lot of a drug store\/dry cleaning complex. The cop\ncars follow suit. Shopping wagons are tossed about. He turns a\ncorner and realizes he has a few seconds before they're on top of\nhim again. He screeches up next to a teenager in a sports car.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nAll right, fella, smog check.

STANWYK\nWhat?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch holds out an\nenvelope.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nRead this, please.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANWYK\nWait a second ---<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nCut the crap and read it.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Stanwyk unfolds the\npaper.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(continuing)\nUnless my people hear differently, this\nletter goes out at midnight.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">256 INSERT LETTER<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">We see that it is\naddressed to:<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">JOHN BOYD\n<b>CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD\n<\/b>BOYD AVIATION<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">257 STANWYK<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANYK\n(reading)\n'Dear Sir: Alan Stanwyk murdered me\ntonight. The charred remains found\nby the police in the Jaguar are\nmine, not his. Mr. Stanwyk, using\nmy name and passport, boarded Pan Am\nFlight 306 for Rio, where he intends\nto establish residence with ---'<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He stares at Fletch.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">258 FLETCH<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He is lifting\nStanwyk's two attach\u00e9 cases.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nPretty hefty. Keep reading.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">259 STANWYK<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANWYK\n(reading)\n'...with his legal wife, the former\nSally Ann Cavanaugh.'<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Stanwyk stops. He's\nstunned, and not about to read anymore of this.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GAIL'S VOICE (O.S.)\nKeep reading, Alan.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Stanwyk spins to the\ndoorway.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">259-A GAIL STANWYK<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">standing in the\ndoorway.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\nDon't worry, I can take it.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">260 MASTER<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nYou shouldn't be here.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\nI want to hear this.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch takes the\nletter from Alan.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nHe doesn't read my stuff well.\n(reads)\n'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago\nand never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist \neven in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with \nthree million dollars in cash, the result of\nGail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock.\nMrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to\npurchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact\nthat can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout\nof Provo.'\n(aside)\nThat was stupid, Alan.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANWYK\nI'd have been long gone.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nAhem.\n(continues reading)\n'Sally Ann can confirm all this when\nthe police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.'<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">Mr. Stanwyk\nblanches. Fletch continues.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n'By the way, Alan is a very big drug smuggler,\nbut you can read all about that in tomorrow's paper.\nSincerely yours, I.M. Fletcher. P.S. Have a nice day.'<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Alan mulls over all\nthis for a few seconds, then smiles wistfully.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANWYK\nBravo, Mr. Fletcher.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThe thing that really tipped it off for me\nwas something your wife said to me while we\nwere in bed together.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Stanwyk shoots a\nsurprised look at Gail. She returns it with an innocent shrug.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANWYK\n(to Fletch)\nAnd what was that?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nHow similar in build you and I are.\nthen I figured it. You bump me off,\nthrow me in the car, and burn me up.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\nMy God, Alan, you really are and a**hole, aren't you?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Now it is Alan's turn\nto shrug innocently.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANWYK\nSorry, darling.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\nYou sonofabitch.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANWYK\nYes, I suppose I am. But I'm not a <u>stupid<\/u> sonofabitch.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Mr. Stanwyk reaches\ninto his desk and pulls out his gun, and levels it at Fletch.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANWYK\nI was already prepared to commit one murder. \nWhat makes you think I won't commit two?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWhoops.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\n(her bravado deflated)\n'Whoops?' What do you mean 'whoops?'\nDon't say 'whoops.'<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANWYK\nI mean, by the time your story gets published, I'll\nbe on the beach. I understand extradition from Rio is\nvery complicated. I'll bet for two murders it's even more so.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nThat is a lighter, isn't it?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Just then, the French\ndoors swing open, and Chief Cummings enters.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nGreetings, everyone.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(dryly)\nThank God, the police.<\/p>\n\n\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANWYK\nWhat the hell are you doing here?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nPut the gun down, Alan. I'll take care of them.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Stanwyk lowers the\ngun.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\n(to Fletch)\nI thought you had this all figured\nout. Good going 'Irwin.'<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nDon't ever call me 'Irwin,' okay?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MRS. STANWYK\n(to Cummings)\nI've got it all under control, \nJerry. You can go now.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\n(laughs)\nUnder control? You idiot. You\ndidn't know who he was?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">During the following\ndialogues, Fletch starts nudging the fireplace's gas lighter jet\nkey with his foot.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nFat Sam left the beach today. So did Gummy.\nIt began to occur to me that some things are\nbeginning to happen that maybe I should be aware of.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANWYK\nI said I'll take care of it. Now, a man of your position\nshouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. So go\nhome and I'll call you tomorrow.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nWhat, 'long distance?' I couldn't help but hear\nyou say something about Rio, Alan. You're not \nleaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars\nI staked you for the next load, are you?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nWhoa. Well, you two obviously have a lot to talk\nover, so we'll go catch the last ten minutes of <u>Dynasty.<\/u><\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch and Gail\nactually start to leave, but Cummings draws his gun and fires\nover their heads. They dive for the floor, landing on the side of\nthe fireplace. Fletch palms a Zippo lighter from his pocket.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">MR. STANWYK\nJerry, you're simply going to have to trust me.\nI've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy\nand now you're jeopardizing everything.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nYour 'foolproof' way is going to land my a** on\nthe front page while you're basking in Rio.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n...with your money.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Cummings turns his\nhead momentarily to consider what Fletch has said, and Stanwyk\ntakes advantage of the distraction to go for his gun. But he is\ntoo slow. Cummings shoots once, striking Stanwyk in the chest,\nkilling him instantly.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Gail screams in\nhorror. Cummings turns to Fletch.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">CUMMINGS\nThis one's going to be even more fun.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(striking the Zippo)\nGo ahead. Make my evening.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch hurls the\nlighter into the fireplace, causing a great whoosh of flames.\nCummings throws his hands up in front of his face and Fletch\nleaps at him, wrestling him to the ground. Cummings is the\nstronger of the two, and just as he starts to gain dominance over\nFletch, Gail Stanwyk staggers to her feet, picks up her husband's\ntennis racket in it's wooden brace, and slams it against\nCummings' head with all her might.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">The Chief is knocked\nout.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch lies there,\npanting, trying to catch his breath. He looks up at Gail, still\nholding the racket, and staring at Alan's body. Fletch hustles\nher out of the room.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">260-A HALLWAY<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI'm calling the police. Then I'm\nleaving. You wait here for them.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GAIL\nWhere are you going?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nAway. I think it might take you a while to get \nyour life back together. You don't need me around.\n(indicates the library)\nDon't go back in there.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He starts to leave.\nShe calls after him.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GAIL\n(still holding the racket)\nI really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't I?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(smiles)\nYou sure did.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch exits.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">DISSOLVE TO<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">261 EXT. RIO DE\nJANEIRO - DAY<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">With Sugarloaf\nMountain in the b.g., Fletch lies in a lounge chair, sipping an\nexotic drink, watching the cavorting lovelies and playing his\nbattered Casio. This is obviously at some very expensive beach\nclub or hotel, as witnessed by the uniformed servant who brings a\ntelephone.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">WAITER\n(Brazilian accent)\nYour call is come through.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nFar out.\n(to the phone)\nLarry? It's Fletch.\n(pause, looks around)\nWell, it's not 'Fat Sam's', but...any port in a storm.\n(pause)\nOh, tell Frank I need a couple of months.\nThe fifty grand's lasting longer than I thought.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He pauses again to\nlisten to Larry, but sees something O.S. that takes over his\nattention. he doesn't wait for Larry to finish what she's saying.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nI gotta go, Lar.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He hangs up and\nstands. We see that Gail has just walked up to him. The way they\nlook at each other indicates they have not seen each other for\nawhile, and her arrival is a surprise to Fletch.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GAIL\nJohn Ultramalensky, right?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nRight.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GAIL\nGod, I haven't seen you since the wedding.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nGee, I must have been sh*t-faced at your wedding, I don't ---<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GAIL\nNot mine, stupid. Yours.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\n(big smile)\nWhat are you doing here?<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">They start walking\ndown the beach. We stay right with them.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">GAIL\nI couldn't sit home and play the mournful \nwidow anymore, and the police didn't need me,\nso I tried watching a Lakers game on TV, \nbut the announcer talked to fast and I\ncouldn't understand a lot of what was \nhappening, so I figured if I came\ndown here maybe you could explain the\nrules to me, and besides, I missed you.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nNo problem.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">He puts his arm\naround her, as we watch them leave us behind and walk off down\nthe beach.<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">FLETCH\nBasketball, of course, was invented in France,\nand is played with a large ball, two tongue \ndepressors and a fish....<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">Fletch ad-libs just\nlike Chevy Chase would as they walk further away down the beach\nuntil we....<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"left\">FADE OUT<\/p>\n\n<p align=\"center\">THE END<\/p>\n<\/td>\n  <\/tr>\n<\/table>\n\n\n<b>\n<\/b>\n<b><\/b><\/pre><br>\n<table width=\"85%\" border=\"0\" align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"body\" style=\"BORDER-TOP: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #000000 1px solid;\">\n  <tr> \n\t<td align=center>\n\t<td><h1>Fletch<\/h1><br><br>\n\t    <b>Writers<\/b> : &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href=\"\/writer.php?w=Phil A.
