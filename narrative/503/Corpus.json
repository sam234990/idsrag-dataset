{"ori_id":"759acf6f6cdbe61db831a1c7c2771d18bd5f68d3","title":"Saint Ronan's Well","context":"Saint Ronan's Well\n The novel concerns the rivalry of two men: Valentine Bulmer, the Earl of Etherington, and his half-brother Francis Tyrrel. Both wish to marry Miss Clara Mowbray, who is the sister of John, the laird of Saint Ronan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\nSaint Ronan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Well is a spa at Innerleithen, a town near Peebles in southern Scotland.Valentine Bulmer and his half-brother Francis Tyrrel had been Mrs Dods' guests at Cleikum Inn when they were students from Edinburgh, and she gladly welcomed Francis when he arrived, some years afterwards, to stay at the inn again, to fish and sketch in the neighbourhood. A mineral spring had in the meantime been discovered at Saint Ronan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and he was invited by the fashionable visitors to dine with them at the Fox Hotel, where he quarrelled with an English baronet named Sir Bingo Binks. On his way back to the Cleikum, he met Clara Mowbray, to whom he had been secretly engaged during his former visit; he had been prevented from marrying her by the treachery of Bulmer, who had now succeeded to the earldom, and was expected at the spa. Tyrrel was visited by Captain MacTurk, and accepted a challenge from the baronet, but failed to keep his appointment, and was posted as an adventurer by the committee of management. He also disappeared from the inn, leading his hostess to consult Mr Bindloose, the sheriff's clerk, under the belief that he had been murdered. A Mr Touchwood came to change a bill, and talked of having been abroad for many years. He showed great interest in the affairs of the Mowbray family, and, having taken up his quarters at the Cleikum, made friends with Rev Mr Cargill, who had been disappointed in love, and startled him with a rumour that Clara was about to be married.\nSoon after the earl's arrival, it was reported that he had been shot in the arm by a foot-pad; and, while his wound was healing, he spent his time gambling with John Mowbray, the young laird of St Ronan's, who had borrowed his sister Clara's money to try to improve his luck. Having allowed him to win a considerable sum, his lordship made proposals for Clara's hand, explaining that his grand-uncle had disinherited his only son, and devised his estate to him, on condition that he chose as a wife a lady of the name of Mowbray. In a letter to his friend Jekyl, the earl confessed that he had been winged in a duel with Tyrrel, whom he met on his way to fight Sir Bingo, and that he had also wounded Tyrrel. A few days afterwards the company at the Well assembled at Shaw's Castle to take part in a play, and Mr Touchwood persuaded Rev Mr Cargill to accompany him. While they were walking in the grounds the minister reminded Clara of a secret in his keeping, which made it impossible for her to marry. He also encountered the earl, and, believing him to be Bulmer, attempted to warn him.\nThe next morning, as John Mowbray was endeavouring to induce Clara to consent to the marriage, he received an anonymous communication that the earl was an impostor; and, in an interview with him, she rejected his suit with loathing and scorn. His lordship then wrote to Jekyl, telling him the circumstances under which, when he was only sixteen, he had arranged with Mr Cargill for a secret marriage between her and Tyrrel; but, learning subsequently the contents of his uncle's will, had incurred their lifelong hatred by impersonating his brother at the ceremony. Tyrrel, who after the duel had gone to a nearby village to recover from his wound, reappeared just in time to rescue Mr Touchwood from drowning; and, at an interview with Jekyl, who undertook to clear his character, offered to forgo his claim to the earldom, of which he had proof, if his brother would leave Clara alone. The earl sneered at the proposal, and, as he was forming fresh schemes for attaining his end, he discovered that Hannah Irwin, Clara's former companion, was dying at St Ronan's, and anxious to confess her share in the secret marriage. Solmes, the earl's valet, was instructed to carry her off, while his master got the brother into his power by ruining him at play, and then promised to cancel the debt if Clara consented to acknowledge him as her husband within four-and-twenty hours.\nMowbray believed he had prevailed with his sister, when Mr Touchwood unexpectedly arrived, and announced himself as Scrogie, the disinherited son, who by bribing Solmes, and in other ways, had learnt everyone's secrets, and was ready with his fortune to arrange all their difficulties. However, Clara had escaped from her room during the night, and, after appearing at the manse to forgive her cousin, who had been confided to Mr Cargill's care, had made her way to the Cleikum, where, in a seeming trance, she had a final interview with Tyrrel, and died soon afterwards from congestion of the brain. Mowbray, meanwhile, in his search for her, encountered the earl and his companions engaged in a shooting match, and killed him in a duel arranged on the spot by Captain MacTurk, with whom he fled to the Continent to escape imprisonment. Mr Touchwood had consequently to seek some other outlet for his wealth, and the Etherington estates were never claimed by the rightful heir, who determined to pass the remainder of his life in a Moravian mission.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of St. Ronan's Well, by Sir Walter Scott\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

RONAN'S WELL.\n\n\n\"'St. Ronan's Well' is not so much my favourite as certain of its\npredecessors,\" Lady Louisa Stuart wrote to Scott on March 26, 1824. \"Yet\nstill I see the author's hand in it, _et c'est tout dire_. Meg Dods, the\nmeeting\" (vol. i. chap. ix.), \"and the last scene between Clara and her\nbrother, are marked with the true stamp, not to be matched or mistaken.\nIs the Siege of Ptolemais really on the anvil?\" she goes on, speaking of\nthe projected Crusading Tales, and obviously anxious to part company\nwith \"St. Ronan's Well.\" All judgments have not agreed with Lady\nLouisa's. There is a literary legend or fable according to which a\nnumber of distinguished men, all admirers of Scott, wrote down\nseparately the name of their favourite Waverley novel, and all, when the\npapers were compared, had written \"St. Ronan's.\" Sydney Smith, writing\nto Constable on Dec. 28, 1823, described the new story as \"far the best\nthat has appeared for some time. Every now and then there is some\nmistaken or overcharged humour--but much excellent delineation of\ncharacter, the story very well told, and the whole very interesting.\nLady Binks, the old landlady, and Touchwood are all very good. Mrs.\nBlower particularly so. So are MacTurk and Lady Penelope. I wish he\nwould give his people better names; Sir Bingo Binks is quite\nridiculous.... The curtain should have dropped on finding Clara's\nglove. Some of the serious scenes with Clara and her brother are very\nfine: the knife scene masterly. In her light and gay moments Clara is\nvery vulgar; but Sir Walter always fails in well-bred men and women, and\nyet who has seen more of both? and who, in the ordinary intercourse of\nsociety, is better bred? Upon the whole, I call this a very successful\nexhibition.\"\n\nWe have seldom found Sydney Smith giving higher praise, and nobody can\ndeny the justice of the censure with which it is qualified. Scott\nhimself explains, in his Introduction, how, in his quest of novelty, he\ninvaded modern life, and the domain of Miss Austen. Unhappily he proved\nby example the truth of his own opinion that he could do \"the big\nbow-wow strain\" very well, but that it was not his _celebrare domestica\nfacta_. Unlike George Sand, Sir Walter had humour abundantly, but, as\nthe French writer said of herself, he was wholly destitute of _esprit_.\n\nWe need not linger over definition of these qualities; but we must\nrecognise, in Scott, the absence of lightness of touch, of delicacy in\nthe small sword-play of conversation. In fencing, all should be done,\nthe masters tell us, with the fingers. Scott works not even with the\nwrist, but with the whole arm. The two-handed sword, the old claymore,\nare his weapons, not the rapier. This was plain enough in the\nword-combats of Queen Mary and her lady gaoler in Loch Leven. Much more\nconspicuous is the \"swashing blow\" in the repartee of \"St. Ronan's.\" The\ninsults lavished on Lady Binks are violent and cruel; even Clara Mowbray\ntaunts her. Now Lady Binks is in the same parlous case as the\npostmistress who dreed penance \"for ante-nup,\" as Meg Dods says in an\ninterrupted harangue, and we know that, to the author's mind, Clara\nMowbray had no right to throw stones. All these jeers are offensive to\ngenerous feeling, and in the mouth of Clara are intolerable. Lockhart\nremarked in Scott a singular bluntness of the sense of smell and of\ntaste. He could drink corked wine without a suspicion that there was\nanything wrong with it. This curious obtuseness of a physical sense, in\none whose eyesight was so keen, who, \"aye was the first to find the\nhare\" in coursing, seems to correspond with his want of lightness in the\ninvention of _badinage_. He tells us that, for a long while at least, he\nhad been unacquainted with the kind of society, the idle, useless\nunderbred society, of watering-places. Are we to believe that the\ncompany at Gilsland, for instance, where he met and wooed Miss\nCharpentier, was like the company at St. Ronan's? Lockhart vouches for\nthe snobbishness, \"the mean admiration of mean things,\" the devotion to\nthe slimmest appearances of rank. All this is credible enough, but, if\nthere existed a society as dull and base as that which we meet in the\npages of \"Mr. Soapy Sponge,\" and Surtees's other novels, assuredly it\nwas no theme for the great and generous spirit of Sir Walter. The worst\nkind of manners always prevail among people whom moderns call \"the\nsecond-rate smart,\" and these are drawn in \"St. Ronan's Well.\" But we\nmay believe that, even there, manners are no longer quite so hideous as\nin the little Tweedside watering-place. The extinction of duelling has\ndestroyed, or nearly destroyed, the swaggering style of truculence;\npeople could not behave as Mowbray and Sir Bingo behave to Tyrrel, in\nthe after-dinner scene. The Man of Peace, the great MacTurk, with his\nharangues translated from the language of Ossian, is no longer needed,\nand no longer possible. Supposing manners to be correctly described in\n\"St. Ronan's,\" the pessimist himself must admit that manners have\nimproved. But it is not without regret that we see a genius born for\nchivalry labouring in this unworthy and alien matter.\n\nThe English critics delighted to accuse Scott of having committed\nliterary suicide. He had only stepped off the path to which he presently\nreturned. He was unfitted to write the domestic novel, and even in \"St.\nRonan's\" he introduces events of romantic improbability. These enable\nhim to depict scenes of the most passionate tragedy, as in the meeting\nof Clara and Tyrrel. They who have loved so blindly and so kindly should\nnever have met, or never parted. It is like a tragic rendering of the\nscene where Diana Vernon and Osbaldistone encounter each other on the\nmoonlit moor. The wild words of Clara, \"Is it so, and was it even\nyourself whom I saw even now?... And, all things considered, I do carry\non the farce of life wonderfully well,\"--all this passage, with the\nsilence of the man, is on the highest level of poetic invention, and\nClara ranks with Ophelia. To her strain of madness we may ascribe,\nperhaps, what Sydney Smith calls the vulgarity of her lighter moments.\nBut here the genius of Shakspeare is faultless, where Scott's is most\nfaulty and most mistaken.\n\nMuch confusion is caused in \"St. Ronan's Well\" by Scott's concession to\nthe delicacy of James Ballantyne. What has shaken Clara's brain? Not her\nsham marriage, for that was innocent, and might be legally annulled.\nLockhart writes (vii. 208): \"Sir Walter had shown a remarkable degree of\ngood-nature in the composition of this novel. When the end came in view,\nJames Ballantyne suddenly took vast alarm about a particular feature in\nthe heroine's history. In the original conception, and in the book as\nactually written and printed, Miss Mowbray's mock marriage had not\nhalted at the profane ceremony of the church; and the delicate printer\nshrank from the idea of obtruding on the fastidious public the\npossibility of any personal contamination having occurred to a high-born\ndamsel of the nineteenth century.\" Scott answered: \"You would never\nhave quarrelled with it had the thing happened to a girl in gingham--the\nsilk petticoat can make little difference.\" \"James reclaimed with double\nenergy, and called Constable to the rescue; and, after some pause, the\nauthor very reluctantly consented to cancel and re-write about\ntwenty-four pages, which was enough to obliterate, to a certain extent,\nthe dreaded scandal--and, in a similar degree, as he always persisted,\nto perplex and weaken the course of his narrative, and the dark effect\nof its catastrophe.\"\n\nFrom a communication printed in the \"Athen\u00c3\u00a6um\" of Feb. 4, 1893, extracts\nfrom the original proof-sheets, it seems that Lockhart forgot the\noriginal plan of the novel. The mock marriage _did_ halt at the church\ndoor, but Clara's virtue had yielded to her real lover, Tyrrel, before\nthe ceremony. Hannah Irwin had deliberately made opportunities for the\nlovers' meeting, and at last, as she says, in a cancelled passage, \"the\ndevil and Hannah Irwin prevailed.\" There followed remorse, and a\ndetermination not to meet again before the Church made them one, and, on\nthe head of this, the mock marriage shook Clara's reason. This was the\noriginal plan; it declares itself in the scene between Tyrrel and Clara\n(vol. i. chap, ix.): \"Wherefore should not sorrow be the end of sin and\nfolly?\" The reviewer in the \"Monthly Review\" (1824) says \"there is a\nhint of some deeper cause of grief (see the confession to the brother),\nbut it is highly problematical.\" For all this the delicacy of James\nBallantyne is to blame--his delicacy, and Scott's concessions to a\nrespectable man and a bad critic.\n\nThe origin of \"St. Ronan's Well\" has been described by Lockhart in a\nfamiliar passage. As Laidlaw, Scott, and Lockhart were riding along the\nbrow of the triple-peaked Eildon Hills, Scott mentioned \"the row\" that\nwas going on in Paris about \"Quentin Durward.\" \"I can't but think I\ncould make better play still with something German,\" he said. Laidlaw\ngrumbled at this: \"You are always best, like Helen MacGregor, when your\nfoot is on your native heath; and I have often thought that if you were\nto write a novel, and lay the scene _here_ in the very year you were\nwriting it, you would exceed yourself.\" \"Hame's hame,\" quoth Scott,\nsmiling, \"be it ever sae hamely,\" and Laidlaw bade him \"stick to Melrose\nin 1823.\" It was now that Scott spoke of the village tragedy, the\nromance of every house, of every cottage, and told a tale of some\nhorrors in the hamlet that lies beyond Melrose, on the north side of\nTweed. Laidlaw and Lockhart believed that this conversation suggested\n\"St. Ronan's Well,\" the scene of which has been claimed as their own by\nthe people of Innerleithen. This little town is beautifully situated\nwhere the hills of Tweed are steepest, and least resemble the _bosses\nverd\u00c3\u00a2tres_ of Prosper M\u00c3\u00a9rim\u00c3\u00a9e. It is now a manufacturing town, like its\nneighbours, and contributes its quota to the pollution of \"the\nglittering and resolute streams of Tweed.\" The pilgrim will scarce rival\nTyrrel's feat of catching a clean-run salmon in summer, but the scenes\nare extremely pleasing, and indeed, from this point to Dryburgh, the\nbeautiful and fabled river is at its loveliest. It is possible that a\nlittle inn farther up the water, \"The Crook,\" on the border of the\nmoorland, and near Tala Linn, where the Covenanters held a famous\nassembly, may have suggested the name of the \"Cleikum.\" Lockhart\ndescribes the prosperity which soon flowed into Innerleithen, and the\nSt. Ronan's Games, at which the Ettrick Shepherd presided gleefully.\nThey are still held, or were held very lately, but there will never come\nagain such another Shepherd, or such contests with the Flying Tailor of\nEttrick.\n\nApart from the tragedy of Clara, doubtless the better parts of \"St.\nRonan's Well\" are the Scotch characters. Even our generation remembers\nmany a Meg Dods, and he who writes has vividly in his recollection just\nsuch tartness, such goodness of heart, such ungoverned eloquence and\nvigour of rebuke as made Meg famous, successful on the stage, and\nwelcome to her countrymen. These people, Mrs. Blower and Meg, are\nShakspearean, they live with Dame Quickly and Shallow, in the hearts of\nScots, but to the English general they are possibly caviare. In the\ngallant and irascible MacTurk we have the waning Highlander: he\nresembles the Captain of Knockdunder in \"The Heart of Mid Lothian,\" or\nan exaggerated and ill-educated Hector of \"The Antiquary.\" Concerning\nthe women of the tale, it may be said that Lady Binks has great\nqualities, and appears to have been drawn \"with an eye on the object,\"\nas Wordsworth says, and from the life. Lady Penelope seems more\nexaggerated now than she probably did at the time, for the fashion of\naffectation changes. The Winterblossoms and Quacklebens are accurate\nenough in themselves, but are seen through a Blackwoodian atmosphere, as\nit were, through a mist of the temporary and boisterous Scotch humour of\nthe day. The author occasionally stoops to a pun, and, like that which\nHood made in the hearing of Thackeray, the pun is not good. Indeed the\nnovel, in its view of the decay of the Border, the ruined Laird, the\nfrivolous foolish society of the Well, taking the place of sturdy\nWilliam of Deloraine, and farmers like Scott's grandfather, makes a\npicture of decadence as melancholy as \"Redgauntlet.\" \"Not here, O\nApollo, are haunts meet for thee!\" Strangely enough, among the features\nof the time, Scott mentions reckless borrowings, \"accommodation,\" \"Banks\nof Air.\" His own business was based on a \"Bank of Air,\" \"wind-capital,\"\nas Cadell, Constable's partner, calls it, and the bubble was just about\nto burst, though Scott had no apprehension of financial ruin. A horrid\npower is visible in Scott's second picture of _la mauvaise pauvre_, the\nhag who despises and curses the givers of \"handfuls of coals and of\nrice;\" his first he drew in the witches of \"The Bride of Lammermoor.\" He\nhas himself indicated his desire to press hard on the vice of gambling,\nas in \"The Fortunes of Nigel.\" Ruinous at all times and in every shape,\ngambling, in Scott's lifetime, during the Regency, had crippled or\ndestroyed many an historical Scottish family. With this in his mind he\ndrew the portrait of Mowbray of St. Ronan's. His picture of duelling is\nnot more seductive; he himself had lost his friend, Sir Alexander\nBoswell, in a duel; on other occasions this institution had brought\ndiscomfort into his life, and though he was ready to fight General\nGourgaud with Napoleon's pistols, he cannot have approved of the\npractices of the MacTurks and Bingo Binkses. A maniac, as his\ncorrespondence shows, challenged Sir Walter, insisting that he was\npointed at and ridiculed in the character of MacTurk. (Abbotsford MSS.)\nIt is interesting to have the picture of contemporary manners from\nScott's hand--Meg Dods remains among his immortal portraits; but a novel\nin which the absurd will of fiction and the conventional Nabob are\nnecessary machinery can never be ranked so high as even \"The Monastery\"\nand \"Peveril.\" In Scotland, however, it was infinitely more successful\nthan its admirable successor \"Redgauntlet.\"\n\nANDREW LANG.\n_December 1893._\n\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTO\n\nST. RONAN'S WELL.\n\n\nThe novel which follows is upon a plan different from any other that the\nauthor has ever written, although it is perhaps the most legitimate\nwhich relates to this kind of light literature.\n\nIt is intended, in a word--_celebrare domestica facta_--to give an\nimitation of the shifting manners of our own time, and paint scenes, the\noriginals of which are daily passing round us, so that a minute's\nobservation may compare the copies with the originals. It must be\nconfessed that this style of composition was adopted by the author\nrather from the tempting circumstance of its offering some novelty in\nhis compositions, and avoiding worn-out characters and positions, than\nfrom the hope of rivalling the many formidable competitors who have\nalready won deserved honours in this department. The ladies, in\nparticular, gifted by nature with keen powers of observation and light\nsatire, have been so distinguished by these works of talent, that,\nreckoning from the authoress of Evelina to her of Marriage, a catalogue\nmight be made, including the brilliant and talented names of Edgeworth,\nAustin, Charlotte Smith, and others, whose success seems to have\nappropriated this province of the novel as exclusively their own. It was\ntherefore with a sense of temerity that the author intruded upon a\nspecies of composition which had been of late practised with such\ndistinguished success. This consciousness was lost, however, under the\nnecessity of seeking for novelty, without which, it was much to be\napprehended, such repeated incursions on his part would nauseate the\nlong indulgent public at the last.\n\nThe scene chosen for the author's little drama of modern life was a\nmineral spring, such as are to be found in both divisions of Britain,\nand which are supplied with the usual materials for redeeming health, or\ndriving away care. The invalid often finds relief from his complaints,\nless from the healing virtues of the Spa itself, than because his system\nof ordinary life undergoes an entire change, in his being removed from\nhis ledger and account-books--from his legal folios and progresses of\ntitle-deeds--from his counters and shelves,--from whatever else forms\nthe main source of his constant anxiety at home, destroys his appetite,\nmars the custom of his exercise, deranges the digestive powers, and\nclogs up the springs of life. Thither, too, comes the saunterer, anxious\nto get rid of that wearisome attendant _himself_, and thither come both\nmales and females, who, upon a different principle, desire to make\nthemselves double.\n\nThe society of such places is regulated, by their very nature, upon a\nscheme much more indulgent than that which rules the world of fashion,\nand the narrow circles of rank in the metropolis. The titles of rank,\nbirth, and fortune, are received at a watering-place without any very\nstrict investigation, as adequate to the purpose for which they are\npreferred; and as the situation infers a certain degree of intimacy and\nsociability for the time, so to whatever heights it may have been\ncarried, it is not understood to imply any duration beyond the length of\nthe season. No intimacy can be supposed more close for the time, and\nmore transitory in its endurance, than that which is attached to a\nwatering-place acquaintance. The novelist, therefore, who fixes upon\nsuch a scene for his tale, endeavours to display a species of society,\nwhere the strongest contrast of humorous characters and manners may be\nbrought to bear on and illustrate each other with less violation of\nprobability, than could be supposed to attend the same miscellaneous\nassemblage in any other situation.\n\nIn such scenes, too, are frequently mingled characters, not merely\nridiculous, but dangerous and hateful. The unprincipled gamester, the\nheartless fortune-hunter, all those who eke out their means of\nsubsistence by pandering to the vices and follies of the rich and gay,\nwho drive, by their various arts, foibles into crimes, and imprudence\ninto acts of ruinous madness, are to be found where their victims\nnaturally resort, with the same certainty that eagles are gathered\ntogether at the place of slaughter. By this the author takes a great\nadvantage for the management of his story, particularly in its darker\nand more melancholy passages. The impostor, the gambler, all who live\nloose upon the skirts of society, or, like vermin, thrive by its\ncorruptions, are to be found at such retreats, when they easily, and as\na matter of course, mingle with those dupes, who might otherwise have\nescaped their snares. But besides those characters who are actually\ndangerous to society, a well-frequented watering-place generally\nexhibits for the amusement of the company, and the perplexity and\namazement of the more inexperienced, a sprinkling of persons called by\nthe newspapers eccentric characters--individuals, namely, who, either\nfrom some real derangement of their understanding, or, much more\nfrequently, from an excess of vanity, are ambitious of distinguishing\nthemselves by some striking peculiarity in dress or address,\nconversation or manners, and perhaps in all. These affectations are\nusually adopted, like Drawcansir's extravagances, to show _they dare_;\nand I must needs say, those who profess them are more frequently to be\nfound among the English, than among the natives of either of the other\ntwo divisions of the united kingdoms. The reason probably is, that the\nconsciousness of wealth, and a sturdy feeling of independence, which\ngenerally pervade the English nation, are, in a few individuals,\nperverted into absurdity, or at least peculiarity. The witty Irishman,\non the contrary, adapts his general behaviour to that of the best\nsociety, or that which he thinks such; nor is it any part of the shrewd\nScot's national character unnecessarily to draw upon himself public\nattention. These rules, however, are not without their exceptions; for\nwe find men of every country playing the eccentric at these independent\nresorts of the gay and the wealthy, where every one enjoys the license\nof doing what is good in his own eyes.\n\nIt scarce needed these obvious remarks to justify a novelist's choice of\na watering-place as the scene of a fictitious narrative. Unquestionably,\nit affords every variety of character, mixed together in a manner which\ncannot, without a breach of probability, be supposed to exist elsewhere;\nneither can it be denied that in the concourse which such miscellaneous\ncollections of persons afford, events extremely different from those of\nthe quiet routine of ordinary life may, and often do, take place.\n\nIt is not, however, sufficient that a mine be in itself rich and easily\naccessible; it is necessary that the engineer who explores it should\nhimself, in mining phrase, have an accurate knowledge of the _country_,\nand possess the skill necessary to work it to advantage. In this\nrespect, the author of Saint Ronan's Well could not be termed fortunate.\nHis habits of life had not led him much, of late years at least, into\nits general or bustling scenes, nor had he mingled often in the society\nwhich enables the observer to \"shoot folly as it flies.\" The consequence\nperhaps was, that the characters wanted that force and precision which\ncan only be given by a writer who is familiarly acquainted with his\nsubject. The author, however, had the satisfaction to chronicle his\ntestimony against the practice of gambling, a vice which the devil has\ncontrived to render all his own, since it is deprived of whatever pleads\nan apology for other vices, and is founded entirely on the cold-blooded\ncalculation of the most exclusive selfishness. The character of the\ntraveller, meddling, self-important, and what the ladies call fussing,\nbut yet generous and benevolent in his purposes, was partly taken from\nnature. The story, being entirely modern, cannot require much\nexplanation, after what has been here given, either in the shape of\nnotes, or a more prolix introduction.\n\nIt may be remarked, that the English critics, in many instances, though\nnone of great influence, pursued Saint Ronan's Well with hue and cry,\nmany of the fraternity giving it as their opinion that the author had\nexhausted himself, or, as the technical phrase expresses it, written\nhimself out; and as an unusual tract of success too often provokes many\npersons to mark and exaggerate a slip when it does occur, the author was\npublicly accused, in prose and verse, of having committed a literary\nsuicide in this unhappy attempt. The voices, therefore, were, for a\ntime, against Saint Ronan's on the southern side of the Tweed.\n\nIn the author's own country, it was otherwise. Many of the characters\nwere recognised as genuine Scottish portraits, and the good fortune\nwhich had hitherto attended the productions of the Author of Waverley,\ndid not desert, notwithstanding the ominous vaticinations of its\ncensurers, this new attempt, although out of his ordinary style.\n\n_1st February, 1832._\n\n\n\n\nST. RONAN'S WELL.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nAN OLD-WORLD LANDLADY.\n\n    But to make up my tale,\n    She breweth good ale,\n    And thereof maketh sale.\n\nSKELTON.\n\n\nAlthough few, if any, of the countries of Europe, have increased so\nrapidly in wealth and cultivation as Scotland during the last half\ncentury, Sultan Mahmoud's owls might nevertheless have found in\nCaledonia, at any term within that flourishing period, their dowery of\nruined villages. Accident or local advantages have, in many instances,\ntransferred the inhabitants of ancient hamlets, from the situations\nwhich their predecessors chose with more respect to security than\nconvenience, to those in which their increasing industry and commerce\ncould more easily expand itself; and hence places which stand\ndistinguished in Scottish history, and which figure in David M'Pherson's\nexcellent historical map,[I-A][I-1] can now only be discerned from the wild\nmoor by the verdure which clothes their site, or, at best, by a few\nscattered ruins, resembling pinfolds, which mark the spot of their\nformer existence.\n\nThe little village of St. Ronan's, though it had not yet fallen into the\nstate of entire oblivion we have described, was, about twenty years\nsince, fast verging towards it. The situation had something in it so\nromantic, that it provoked the pencil of every passing tourist; and we\nwill endeavour, therefore, to describe it in language which can scarcely\nbe less intelligible than some of their sketches, avoiding, however, for\nreasons which seem to us of weight, to give any more exact indication of\nthe site, than that it is on the southern side of the Forth, and not\nabove thirty miles distant from the English frontier.\n\nA river of considerable magnitude pours its streams through a narrow\nvale, varying in breadth from two miles to a fourth of that distance,\nand which, being composed of rich alluvial soil, is, and has long been,\nenclosed, tolerably well inhabited, and cultivated with all the skill of\nScottish agriculture. Either side of this valley is bounded by a chain\nof hills, which, on the right in particular, may be almost termed\nmountains. Little brooks arising in these ridges, and finding their way\nto the river, offer each its own little vale to the industry of the\ncultivator. Some of them bear fine large trees, which have as yet\nescaped the axe, and upon the sides of most there are scattered patches\nand fringes of natural copsewood, above and around which the banks of\nthe stream arise, somewhat desolate in the colder months, but in summer\nglowing with dark purple heath, or with the golden lustre of the broom\nand gorse. This is a sort of scenery peculiar to those countries, which\nabound, like Scotland, in hills and in streams, and where the traveller\nis ever and anon discovering in some intricate and unexpected recess, a\nsimple and silvan beauty, which pleases him the more, that it seems to\nbe peculiarly his own property as the first discoverer.\n\nIn one of these recesses, and so near its opening as to command the\nprospect of the river, the broader valley, and the opposite chain of\nhills, stood, and, unless neglect and desertion have completed their\nwork, still stands, the ancient and decayed village of St. Ronan's. The\nsite was singularly picturesque, as the straggling street of the village\nran up a very steep hill, on the side of which were clustered, as it\nwere, upon little terraces, the cottages which composed the place,\nseeming, as in the Swiss towns on the Alps, to rise above each other\ntowards the ruins of an old castle, which continued to occupy the crest\nof the eminence, and the strength of which had doubtless led the\nneighbourhood to assemble under its walls for protection. It must,\nindeed, have been a place of formidable defence, for, on the side\nopposite to the town, its walls rose straight up from the verge of a\ntremendous and rocky precipice, whose base was washed by Saint Ronan's\nburn, as the brook was entitled. On the southern side, where the\ndeclivity was less precipitous, the ground had been carefully levelled\ninto successive terraces, which ascended to the summit of the hill, and\nwere, or rather had been, connected by staircases of stone, rudely\nornamented. In peaceful periods these terraces had been occupied by the\ngardens of the Castle, and in times of siege they added to its security,\nfor each commanded the one immediately below it, so that they could be\nseparately and successively defended, and all were exposed to the fire\nfrom the place itself--a massive square tower of the largest size,\nsurrounded, as usual, by lower buildings, and a high embattled wall. On\nthe northern side arose a considerable mountain, of which the descent\nthat lay between the eminence on which the Castle was situated seemed a\ndetached portion, and which had been improved and deepened by three\nsuccessive huge trenches. Another very deep trench was drawn in front of\nthe main entrance from the east, where the principal gateway formed the\ntermination of the street, which, as we have noticed, ascended from the\nvillage, and this last defence completed the fortifications of the\ntower.\n\nIn the ancient gardens of the Castle, and upon all sides of it excepting\nthe western, which was precipitous, large old trees had found root,\nmantling the rock and the ancient and ruinous walls with their dusky\nverdure, and increasing the effect of the shattered pile which towered\nup from the centre.\n\nSeated on the threshold of this ancient pile, where the \"proud porter\"\nhad in former days \"rear'd himself,\"[I-2] a stranger had a complete and\ncommanding view of the decayed village, the houses of which, to a\nfanciful imagination, might seem as if they had been suddenly arrested\nin hurrying down the precipitous hill, and fixed as if by magic in the\nwhimsical arrangement which they now presented. It was like a sudden\npause in one of Amphion's country-dances, when the huts which were to\nform the future Thebes were jigging it to his lute. But, with such an\nobserver, the melancholy excited by the desolate appearance of the\nvillage soon overcame all the lighter frolics of the imagination.\nOriginally constructed on the humble plan used in the building of Scotch\ncottages about a century ago, the greater part of them had been long\ndeserted; and their fallen roofs, blackened gables, and ruinous walls,\nshowed Desolation's triumph over Poverty. On some huts the rafters,\nvarnished with soot, were still standing, in whole or in part, like\nskeletons, and a few, wholly or partially covered with thatch, seemed\nstill inhabited, though scarce habitable; for the smoke of the\npeat-fires, which prepared the humble meal of the indwellers, stole\nupwards, not only from the chimneys, its regular vent, but from various\nother crevices in the roofs. Nature, in the meanwhile, always changing,\nbut renewing as she changes, was supplying, by the power of vegetation,\nthe fallen and decaying marks of human labour. Small pollards, which had\nbeen formerly planted around the little gardens, had now waxed into huge\nand high forest trees; the fruit-trees had extended their branches over\nthe verges of the little yards, and the hedges had shot up into huge and\nirregular bushes; while quantities of dock, and nettles, and hemlock,\nhiding the ruined walls, were busily converting the whole scene of\ndesolation into a picturesque forest-bank.\n\nTwo houses in St. Ronan's were still in something like decent repair;\nplaces essential--the one to the spiritual weal of the inhabitants, the\nother to the accommodation of travellers. These were the clergyman's\nmanse, and the village inn. Of the former we need only say, that it\nformed no exception to the general rule by which the landed proprietors\nof Scotland seem to proceed in lodging their clergy, not only in the\ncheapest, but in the ugliest and most inconvenient house which the\ngenius of masonry can contrive. It had the usual number of\nchimneys--two, namely--rising like asses' ears at either end, which\nanswered the purpose for which they were designed as ill as usual. It\nhad all the ordinary leaks and inlets to the fury of the elements, which\nusually form the subject of the complaints of a Scottish incumbent to\nhis brethren of the presbytery; and, to complete the picture, the\nclergyman being a bachelor, the pigs had unmolested admission to the\ngarden and court-yard, broken windows were repaired with brown paper,\nand the disordered and squalid appearance of a low farm-house, occupied\nby a bankrupt tenant, dishonoured the dwelling of one, who, besides his\nclerical character, was a scholar and a gentleman, though a little of a\nhumourist.\n\nBeside the manse stood the kirk of St. Ronan's, a little old mansion\nwith a clay floor, and an assemblage of wretched pews, originally of\ncarved oak, but heedfully clouted with white fir-deal. But the external\nform of the church was elegant in the outline, having been built in\nCatholic times, when we cannot deny to the forms of ecclesiastical\narchitecture that grace, which, as good Protestants, we refuse to their\ndoctrine. The fabric hardly raised its grey and vaulted roof among the\ncrumbling hills of mortality by which it was surrounded, and was indeed\nso small in size, and so much lowered in height by the graves on the\noutside, which ascended half way up the low Saxon windows, that it might\nitself have appeared only a funeral vault, or mausoleum of larger size.\nIts little square tower, with the ancient belfry, alone distinguished it\nfrom such a monument. But when the grey-headed beadle turned the keys\nwith his shaking hand, the antiquary was admitted into an ancient\nbuilding, which, from the style of its architecture, and some monuments\nof the Mowbrays of St. Ronan's, which the old man was accustomed to\npoint out, was generally conjectured to be as early as the thirteenth\ncentury.\n\nThese Mowbrays of St. Ronan's seem to have been at one time a very\npowerful family. They were allied to, and friends of the house of\nDouglas, at the time when the overgrown power of that heroic race made\nthe Stewarts tremble on the Scottish throne. It followed that, when, as\nour old _na\u00c3\u00aff_ historian expresses it, \"no one dared to strive with a\nDouglas, nor yet with a Douglas's man, for if he did, he was sure to\ncome by the waur,\" the family of St. Ronan's shared their prosperity,\nand became lords of almost the whole of the rich valley of which their\nmansion commanded the prospect. But upon the turning of the tide, in the\nreign of James II., they became despoiled of the greater part of those\nfair acquisitions, and succeeding events reduced their importance still\nfarther. Nevertheless, they were, in the middle of the seventeenth\ncentury, still a family of considerable note; and Sir Reginald Mowbray,\nafter the unhappy battle of Dunbar, distinguished himself by the\nobstinate defence of the Castle against the arms of Cromwell, who,\nincensed at the opposition which he had unexpectedly encountered in an\nobscure corner, caused the fortress to be dismantled and blown up with\ngunpowder.\n\nAfter this catastrophe the old Castle was abandoned to ruin; but Sir\nReginald, when, like Allan Ramsay's Sir William Worthy, he returned\nafter the Revolution, built himself a house in the fashion of that later\nage, which he prudently suited in size to the diminished fortunes of his\nfamily. It was situated about the middle of the village, whose vicinity\nwas not in those days judged any inconvenience, upon a spot of ground\nmore level than was presented by the rest of the acclivity, where, as we\nsaid before, the houses were notched as it were into the side of the\nsteep bank, with little more level ground about them than the spot\noccupied by their site. But the Laird's house had a court in front and a\nsmall garden behind, connected with another garden, which, occupying\nthree terraces, descended, in emulation of the orchards of the old\nCastle, almost to the banks of the stream.\n\nThe family continued to inhabit this new messuage until about fifty\nyears before the commencement of our history, when it was much damaged\nby a casual fire; and the Laird of the day, having just succeeded to a\nmore pleasant and commodious dwelling at the distance of about three\nmiles from the village, determined to abandon the habitation of his\nancestors. As he cut down at the same time an ancient rookery, (perhaps\nto defray the expenses of the migration,) it became a common remark\namong the country folk, that the decay of St. Ronan's began when Laird\nLawrence and the crows flew off.\n\nThe deserted mansion, however, was not consigned to owls and birds of\nthe desert; on the contrary, for many years it witnessed more fun and\nfestivity than when it had been the sombre abode of a grave Scottish\nBaron of \"auld lang syne.\" In short, it was converted into an inn, and\nmarked by a huge sign, representing on the one side St. Ronan catching\nhold of the devil's game leg with his Episcopal crook, as the story may\nbe read in his veracious legend, and on the other the Mowbray arms. It\nwas by far the best frequented public-house in that vicinity; and a\nthousand stories were told of the revels which had been held within its\nwalls, and the gambols achieved under the influence of its liquors. All\nthis, however, had long since passed away, according to the lines in my\nfrontispiece,\n\n    \"A merry place, 'twas said, in days of yore;\n    But something ail'd it now,--the place was cursed.\"\n\nThe worthy couple (servants and favourites of the Mowbray family) who\nfirst kept the inn, had died reasonably wealthy, after long carrying on\na flourishing trade, leaving behind them an only daughter. They had\nacquired by degrees not only the property of the inn itself, of which\nthey were originally tenants, but of some remarkably good meadow-land by\nthe side of the brook, which, when touched by a little pecuniary\nnecessity, the Lairds of St. Ronan's had disposed of piecemeal, as the\nreadiest way to portion off a daughter, procure a commission for the\nyounger son, and the like emergencies. So that Meg Dods, when she\nsucceeded to her parents, was a considerable heiress, and, as such, had\nthe honour of refusing three topping-farmers, two bonnet-lairds, and a\nhorse-couper, who successively made proposals to her.\n\nMany bets were laid on the horse-couper's success, but the knowing ones\nwere taken in. Determined to ride the fore-horse herself, Meg would\nadmit no helpmate who might soon assert the rights of a master; and so,\nin single blessedness, and with the despotism of Queen Bess herself, she\nruled all matters with a high hand, not only over her men-servants and\nmaid-servants, but over the stranger within her gates, who, if he\nventured to oppose Meg's sovereign will and pleasure, or desire to have\neither fare or accommodation different from that which she chose to\nprovide for him, was instantly ejected with that answer which Erasmus\ntells us silenced all complaints in the German inns of his time, _Qu\u00c3\u00a6re\naliud hospitium_;[I-3] or, as Meg expressed it, \"Troop aff wi' ye to\nanother public.\" As this amounted to a banishment in extent equal to\nsixteen miles from Meg's residence, the unhappy party on whom it was\npassed, had no other refuge save by deprecating the wrath of his\nlandlady, and resigning himself to her will. It is but justice to Meg\nDods to state, that though hers was a severe and almost despotic\ngovernment, it could not be termed a tyranny, since it was exercised,\nupon the whole, for the good of the subject.\n\nThe vaults of the old Laird's cellar had not, even in his own day, been\nreplenished with more excellent wines; the only difficulty was to\nprevail on Meg to look for the precise liquor you chose;--to which it\nmay be added, that she often became restiff when she thought a company\nhad had \"as much as did them good,\" and refused to furnish any more\nsupplies. Then her kitchen was her pride and glory; she looked to the\ndressing of every dish herself, and there were some with which she\nsuffered no one to interfere. Such were the cock-a-leeky, and the\nsavoury minced collops, which rivalled in their way even the veal\ncutlets of our old friend Mrs. Hall, at Ferrybridge. Meg's table-linen,\nbed-linen, and so forth, were always home-made, of the best quality,\nand in the best order; and a weary day was that to the chambermaid in\nwhich her lynx eye discovered any neglect of the strict cleanliness\nwhich she constantly enforced. Indeed, considering Meg's country and\ncalling, we were never able to account for her extreme and scrupulous\nnicety, unless by supposing that it afforded her the most apt and\nfrequent pretext for scolding her maids; an exercise in which she\ndisplayed so much eloquence and energy, that we must needs believe it to\nhave been a favourite one.[I-4]\n\nWe have only further to commemorate, the moderation of Meg's reckonings,\nwhich, when they closed the banquet, often relieved the apprehensions,\ninstead of saddening the heart, of the rising guest. A shilling for\nbreakfast, three shillings for dinner, including a pint of old port,\neighteenpence for a snug supper--such were the charges of the inn of St.\nRonan's, under this landlady of the olden world, even after the\nnineteenth century had commenced; and they were ever tendered with the\npious recollection, that her good father never charged half so much, but\nthese weary times rendered it impossible for her to make the lawing\nless.[I-5]\n\nNotwithstanding all these excellent and rare properties, the inn at\nSaint Ronan's shared the decay of the village to which it belonged. This\nwas owing to various circumstances. The high-road had been turned aside\nfrom the place, the steepness of the street being murder (so the\npostilions declared) to their post-horses. It was thought that Meg's\nstern refusal to treat them with liquor, or to connive at their\nexchanging for porter and whisky the corn which should feed their\ncattle, had no small influence on the opinion of those respectable\ngentlemen, and that a little cutting and levelling would have made the\nascent easy enough; but let that pass. This alteration of the highway\nwas an injury which Meg did not easily forgive to the country gentlemen,\nmost of whom she had recollected when children. \"Their fathers,\" she\nsaid, \"wad not have done the like of it to a lone woman.\" Then the decay\nof the village itself, which had formerly contained a set of feuars and\nbonnet-lairds, who, under the name of the Chirupping Club, contrived to\ndrink twopenny, qualified with brandy or whisky, at least twice or\nthrice a-week, was some small loss.\n\nThe temper and manners of the landlady scared away all customers of that\nnumerous class, who will not allow originality to be an excuse for the\nbreach of decorum, and who, little accustomed perhaps to attendance at\nhome, loved to play the great man at an inn, and to have a certain\nnumber of bows, deferential speeches, and apologies, in answer to the\nG--d d--n ye's which they bestow on the house, attendance, and\nentertainment. Unto those who commenced this sort of barter in the\nClachan of Saint Ronan's, well could Meg Dods pay it back, in their own\ncoin; and glad they were to escape from the house with eyes not quite\nscratched out, and ears not more deafened than if they had been within\nhearing of a pitched battle.\n\nNature had formed honest Meg for such encounters; and as her noble soul\ndelighted in them, so her outward properties were in what Tony Lumpkin\ncalls a concatenation accordingly. She had hair of a brindled colour,\nbetwixt black and grey, which was apt to escape in elf-locks from under\nher mutch when she was thrown into violent agitation--long skinny hands,\nterminated by stout talons--grey eyes, thin lips, a robust person, a\nbroad, though flat chest, capital wind, and a voice that could match a\nchoir of fishwomen. She was accustomed to say of herself in her more\ngentle moods, that her bark was worse than her bite; but what teeth\ncould have matched a tongue, which, when in full career, is vouched to\nhave been heard from the Kirk to the Castle of Saint Ronan's?\n\nThese notable gifts, however, had no charms for the travellers of these\nlight and giddy-paced times, and Meg's inn became less and less\nfrequented. What carried the evil to the uttermost was, that a fanciful\nlady of rank in the neighbourhood chanced to recover of some imaginary\ncomplaint by the use of a mineral well about a mile and a half from the\nvillage; a fashionable doctor was found to write an analysis of the\nhealing waters, with a list of sundry cures; a speculative builder took\nland in feu, and erected lodging-houses, shops, and even streets. At\nlength a tontine subscription was obtained to erect an inn, which, for\nthe more grace, was called a hotel; and so the desertion of Meg Dods\nbecame general.[I-6]\n\nShe had still, however, her friends and well-wishers, many of whom\nthought, that as she was a lone woman, and known to be well to pass in\nthe world, she would act wisely to retire from public life, and take\ndown a sign which had no longer fascination for guests. But Meg's spirit\nscorned submission, direct or implied. \"Her father's door,\" she said,\n\"should be open to the road, till her father's bairn should be streekit\nand carried out at it with her feet foremost. It was not for the\nprofit--there was little profit at it;--profit?--there was a dead loss;\nbut she wad not be dung by any of them. They maun hae a hottle,[I-7] maun\nthey?--and an honest public canna serve them! They may hottle that\nlikes; but they shall see that Lucky Dods can hottle on as lang as the\nbest of them--ay, though they had made a Tamteen of it, and linkit aw\ntheir breaths of lives, whilk are in their nostrils, on end of ilk other\nlike a string of wild-geese, and the langest liver bruick a', (whilk was\nsinful presumption,) she would match ilk ane of them as lang as her ain\nwind held out.\" Fortunate it was for Meg, since she had formed this\ndoughty resolution, that although her inn had decayed in custom, her\nland had risen in value in a degree which more than compensated the\nbalance on the wrong side of her books, and, joined to her usual\nprovidence and economy, enabled her to act up to her lofty purpose.\n\nShe prosecuted her trade too with every attention to its diminished\nincome; shut up the windows of one half of her house, to baffle the\ntax-gatherer; retrenched her furniture; discharged her pair of\npost-horses, and pensioned off the old humpbacked postilion who drove\nthem, retaining his services, however, as an assistant to a still more\naged hostler. To console herself for restrictions by which her pride was\nsecretly wounded, she agreed with the celebrated Dick Tinto to re-paint\nher father's sign, which had become rather undecipherable; and Dick\naccordingly gilded the Bishop's crook, and augmented the horrors of the\nDevil's aspect, until it became a terror to all the younger fry of the\nschool-house, and a sort of visible illustration of the terrors of the\narch-enemy, with which the minister endeavoured to impress their infant\nminds.\n\nUnder this renewed symbol of her profession, Meg Dods, or Meg Dorts, as\nshe was popularly termed, on account of her refractory humours, was\nstill patronised by some steady customers. Such were the members of the\nKillnakelty Hunt, once famous on the turf and in the field, but now a\nset of venerable grey-headed sportsmen, who had sunk from fox-hounds to\nbasket-beagles and coursing, and who made an easy canter on their quiet\nnags a gentle induction to a dinner at Meg's. \"A set of honest decent\nmen they were,\" Meg said; \"had their sang and their joke--and what for\nno? Their bind was just a Scots pint over-head, and a tappit-hen to the\nbill, and no man ever saw them the waur o't. It was thae cockle-brained\ncallants of the present day that would be mair owerta'en with a puir\nquart than douce folk were with a magnum.\"\n\nThen there was a set of ancient brethren of the angle from Edinburgh,\nwho visited Saint Ronan's frequently in the spring and summer, a class\nof guests peculiarly acceptable to Meg, who permitted them more latitude\nin her premises than she was known to allow to any other body. \"They\nwere,\" she said, \"pawky auld carles, that kend whilk side their bread\nwas buttered upon. Ye never kend of ony o' them ganging to the spring,\nas they behoved to ca' the stinking well yonder.--Na, na--they were up\nin the morning--had their parritch, wi' maybe a thimblefull of brandy,\nand then awa up into the hills, eat their bit cauld meat on the heather,\nand came hame at e'en with the creel full of caller trouts, and had them\nto their dinner, and their quiet cogue of ale, and their drap punch, and\nwere set singing their catches and glees, as they ca'd them, till ten\no'clock, and then to bed, wi' God bless ye--and what for no?\"\n\nThirdly, we may commemorate some ranting blades, who also came from the\nmetropolis to visit Saint Ronan's, attracted by the humours of Meg, and\nstill more by the excellence of her liquor, and the cheapness of her\nreckonings. These were members of the Helter Skelter Club, of the\nWildfire Club, and other associations formed for the express purpose of\ngetting rid of care and sobriety. Such dashers occasioned many a racket\nin Meg's house, and many a _bourasque_ in Meg's temper. Various were the\narts of flattery and violence by which they endeavoured to get supplies\nof liquor, when Meg's conscience told her they had had too much already.\nSometimes they failed, as when the croupier of the Helter Skelter got\nhimself scalded with the mulled wine, in an unsuccessful attempt to coax\nthis formidable virago by a salute; and the excellent president of the\nWildfire received a broken head from the keys of the cellar, as he\nendeavoured to possess himself of these emblems of authority. But little\ndid these dauntless officials care for the exuberant frolics of Meg's\ntemper, which were to them only \"pretty Fanny's way\"--the _dulces\nAmaryllidis ir\u00c3\u00a6_. And Meg, on her part, though she often called them\n\"drunken ne'er-do-weels, and thoroughbred High-street blackguards,\"\nallowed no other person to speak ill of them in her hearing. \"They were\ndaft callants,\" she said, \"and that was all--when the drink was in, the\nwit was out--ye could not put an auld head upon young shouthers--a young\ncowt will canter, be it up-hill or down--and what for no?\" was her\nuniform conclusion.\n\nNor must we omit, among Meg's steady customers, \"faithful amongst the\nunfaithful found,\" the copper-nosed sheriff-clerk of the county, who,\nwhen summoned by official duty to that district of the shire, warmed by\nrecollections of her double-brewed ale, and her generous Antigua, always\nadvertised that his \"Prieves,\" or \"Comptis,\" or whatever other business\nwas in hand, were to proceed on such a day and hour, \"within the house\nof Margaret Dods, vintner in Saint Ronan's.\"\n\nWe have only farther to notice Meg's mode of conducting herself towards\nchance travellers, who, knowing nothing of nearer or more fashionable\naccommodations, or perhaps consulting rather the state of their purse\nthan of their taste, stumbled upon her house of entertainment. Her\nreception of these was as precarious as the hospitality of a savage\nnation to sailors shipwrecked on their coast. If the guests seemed to\nhave made her mansion their free choice--or if she liked their\nappearance (and her taste was very capricious)--above all, if they\nseemed pleased with what they got, and little disposed to criticise or\ngive trouble, it was all very well. But if they had come to Saint\nRonan's because the house at the Well was full--or if she disliked what\nthe sailor calls the cut of their jib--or if, above all, they were\ncritical about their accommodations, none so likely as Meg to give them\nwhat in her country is called a _sloan_. In fact, she reckoned such\npersons a part of that ungenerous and ungrateful public, for whose sake\nshe was keeping her house open at a dead loss, and who had left her, as\nit were, a victim to her patriotic zeal.\n\nHence arose the different reports concerning the little inn of Saint\nRonan's, which some favoured travellers praised as the neatest and most\ncomfortable old-fashioned house in Scotland, where you had good\nattendance, and good cheer, at moderate rates; while others, less\nfortunate, could only talk of the darkness of the rooms, the homeliness\nof the old furniture, and the detestable bad humour of Meg Dods, the\nlandlady.\n\nReader, if you come from the more sunny side of the Tweed--or even if,\nbeing a Scot, you have had the advantage to be born within the last\ntwenty-five years, you may be induced to think this portrait of Queen\nElizabeth, in Dame Quickly's piqued hat and green apron, somewhat\novercharged in the features. But I appeal to my own contemporaries, who\nhave known wheel-road, bridle-way, and footpath, for thirty years,\nwhether they do not, every one of them, remember Meg Dods--or somebody\nvery like her. Indeed, so much is this the case, that, about the period\nI mention, I should have been afraid to have rambled from the Scottish\nmetropolis, in almost any direction, lest I had lighted upon some one of\nthe sisterhood of Dame Quickly, who might suspect me of having showed\nher up to the public in the character of Meg Dods. At present, though it\nis possible that some one or two of this peculiar class of wild-cats may\nstill exist, their talons must be much impaired by age; and I think they\ncan do little more than sit, like the Giant Pope, in the Pilgrim's\nProgress, at the door of their unfrequented caverns, and grin at the\npilgrims over whom they used formerly to execute their despotism.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[I-1] See Editor's Notes at the end of the Volume. Wherever a similar\nreference occurs, the reader will understand that the same direction\napplies.\n\n[I-2] See the old Ballad of King Estmere, in PERCY'S _Reliques_.\n\n[I-3] In a colloquy of Erasmus, called _Diversaria_, there is a very\nunsavoury description of a German inn of the period, where an objection\nof the guest is answered in the manner expressed in the text--a great\nsign of want of competition on the road.\n\n[I-4] This circumstance shows of itself, that the Meg Dods of the tale\ncannot be identified with her namesake Jenny Dods, who kept the inn at\nHowgate,[I-B] on the Peebles road; for Jenny, far different from our\nheroine, was unmatched as a slattern.\n\n[I-5] This was universally the case in Scotland forty or fifty years ago;\nand so little was charged for a domestic's living when the author became\nfirst acquainted with the road, that a shilling or eighteenpence was\nsufficient board wages for a man-servant, when a crown would not now\nanswer the purpose. It is true the cause of these reasonable charges\nrested upon a principle equally unjust to the landlord, and inconvenient\nto the guest. The landlord did not expect to make any thing upon the\ncharge for eating which his bill contained; in consideration of which,\nthe guest was expected to drink more wine than might be convenient or\nagreeable to him, \"_for the good_,\" as it was called, \"_of the house_.\"\nThe landlord indeed was willing and ready to assist, in this duty, every\nstranger who came within his gates. Other things were in proportion. A\ncharge for lodging, fire, and candle, was long a thing unheard of in\nScotland. A shilling to the housemaid settled all such considerations. I\nsee, from memorandums of 1790, that a young man, with two ponies and a\nserving-lad, might travel from the house of one Meg Dods to another,\nthrough most parts of Scotland, for about five or six shillings a-day.\n\n[I-6] Note I.--Building-Feus in Scotland.\n\n[I-7] This Gallic word (h\u00c3\u00b4tel) was first introduced in Scotland during the\nauthor's childhood, and was so pronounced by the lower class.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II.\n\nTHE GUEST.\n\n    Quis novus hic hospes?\n                         _Dido apud Virgilium._\n\n    Ch'am-maid! The Gemman in the front parlour!\n\nBOOTS'S _free Translation of the \u00c3\u0086neid_.\n\n\nIt was on a fine summer's day that a solitary traveller rode under the\nold-fashioned archway, and alighted in the court-yard of Meg Dods's inn,\nand delivered the bridle of his horse to the humpbacked postilion.\n\"Bring my saddle-bags,\" he said, \"into the house--or stay--I am abler, I\nthink, to carry them than you.\" He then assisted the poor meagre groom\nto unbuckle the straps which secured the humble and now despised\nconvenience, and meantime gave strict charges that his horse should be\nunbridled, and put into a clean and comfortable stall, the girths\nslacked, and a cloth cast over his loins; but that the saddle should not\nbe removed until he himself came to see him dressed.\n\nThe companion of his travels seemed in the hostler's eye deserving of\nhis care, being a strong active horse, fit either for the road or field,\nbut rather high in bone from a long journey, though from the state of\nhis skin it appeared the utmost care had been bestowed to keep him in\ncondition. While the groom obeyed the stranger's directions, the latter,\nwith the saddle-bags laid over his arm, entered the kitchen of the inn.\n\nHere he found the landlady herself in none of her most blessed humours.\nThe cook-maid was abroad on some errand, and Meg, in a close review of\nthe kitchen apparatus, was making the unpleasant discovery, that\ntrenchers had been broken or cracked, pots and saucepans not so\naccurately scoured as her precise notions of cleanliness required,\nwhich, joined to other detections of a more petty description, stirred\nher bile in no small degree; so that while she disarranged and arranged\nthe _bink_, she maundered, in an under tone, complaints and menaces\nagainst the absent delinquent.\n\nThe entrance of a guest did not induce her to suspend this agreeable\namusement--she just glanced at him as he entered, then turned her back\nshort on him, and continued her labour and her soliloquy of lamentation.\nTruth is, she thought she recognised in the person of the stranger, one\nof those useful envoys of the commercial community, called, by\nthemselves and the waiters, _Travellers_, par excellence--by others,\nRiders and Bagmen. Now against this class of customers Meg had peculiar\nprejudices; because, there being no shops in the old village of Saint\nRonan's, the said commercial emissaries, for the convenience of their\ntraffic, always took up their abode at the New Inn, or Hotel, in the\nrising and rival village called Saint Ronan's Well, unless when some\nstraggler, by chance or dire necessity, was compelled to lodge himself\nat the Auld Town, as the place of Meg's residence began to be generally\ntermed. She had, therefore, no sooner formed the hasty conclusion, that\nthe individual in question belonged to this obnoxious class, than she\nresumed her former occupation, and continued to soliloquize and\napostrophize her absent handmaidens, without even appearing sensible of\nhis presence.\n\n\"The huzzy Beenie--the jaud Eppie--the deil's buckie of a\ncallant!--Another plate gane--they'll break me out of house and ha'!\"\n\nThe traveller, who, with his saddle-bags rested on the back of a chair,\nhad waited in silence for some note of welcome, now saw that, ghost or\nno ghost, he must speak first, if he intended to have any notice from\nhis landlady.\n\n\"You are my old acquaintance, Mrs. Margaret Dods?\" said the stranger.\n\n\"What for no?--and wha are ye that speers?\" said Meg, in the same\nbreath, and began to rub a brass candlestick with more vehemence than\nbefore--the dry tone in which she spoke, indicating plainly how little\nconcern she took in the conversation.\n\n\"A traveller, good Mistress Dods, who comes to take up his lodgings here\nfor a day or two.\"\n\n\"I am thinking ye will be mista'en,\" said Meg; \"there's nae room for\nbags or jaugs here--ye've mista'en your road, neighbour--ye maun e'en\nbundle yoursell a bit farther down hill.\"\n\n\"I see you have not got the letter I sent you, Mistress Dods?\" said the\nguest.\n\n\"How should I, man?\" answered the hostess; \"they have ta'en awa the\npost-office from us--moved it down till the Spa-well yonder, as they\nca'd.\"\n\n\"Why, that is but a step off,\" observed the guest.\n\n\"Ye will get there the sooner,\" answered the hostess.\n\n\"Nay, but,\" said the guest, \"if you had sent there for my letter, you\nwould have learned\"----\n\n\"I'm no wanting to learn ony thing at my years,\" said Meg. \"If folk have\nony thing to write to me about, they may gie the letter to John Hislop,\nthe carrier, that has used the road these forty years. As for the\nletters at the post-mistress's, as they ca' her, down by yonder, they\nmay bide in her shop-window, wi' the snaps and bawbee rows, till\nBeltane, or I loose them. I'll never file my fingers with them.\nPost-mistress, indeed!--Upsetting cutty! I mind her fu' weel when she\ndree'd penance for ante-nup\"----\n\nLaughing, but interrupting Meg in good time for the character of the\npost-mistress, the stranger assured her he had sent his fishing-rod and\ntrunk to her confidential friend the carrier, and that he sincerely\nhoped she would not turn an old acquaintance out of her premises,\nespecially as he believed he could not sleep in a bed within five miles\nof Saint Ronan's, if he knew that her Blue room was unengaged.\n\n\"Fishing-rod!--Auld acquaintance!--Blue room!\" echoed Meg, in some\nsurprise; and, facing round upon the stranger, and examining him with\nsome interest and curiosity,--\"Ye'll be nae bagman, then, after a'?\"\n\n\"No,\" said the traveller; \"not since I have laid the saddle-bags out of\nmy hand.\"\n\n\"Weel, I canna say but I am glad of that--I canna bide their yanking way\nof knapping English at every word.--I have kent decent lads amang them\ntoo--What for no?--But that was when they stopped up here whiles, like\nother douce folk; but since they gaed down, the hail flight of them,\nlike a string of wild-geese, to the new-fashioned hottle yonder, I am\ntold there are as mony hellicate tricks played in the travellers' room,\nas they behove to call it, as if it were fu' of drunken young lairds.\"\n\n\"That is because they have not you to keep good order among them,\nMistress Margaret.\"\n\n\"Ay, lad?\" replied Meg, \"ye are a fine blaw-in-my-lug, to think to\ncuittle me off sae cleverly!\" And, facing about upon her guest, she\nhonoured him with a more close and curious investigation than she had at\nfirst designed to bestow upon him.\n\nAll that she remarked was in her opinion rather favourable to the\nstranger. He was a well-made man, rather above than under the middle\nsize, and apparently betwixt five-and-twenty and thirty years of\nage--for, although he might, at first glance, have passed for one who\nhad attained the latter period, yet, on a nearer examination, it seemed\nas if the burning sun of a warmer climate than Scotland, and perhaps\nsome fatigue, both of body and mind, had imprinted the marks of care and\nof manhood upon his countenance, without abiding the course of years.\nHis eyes and teeth were excellent, and his other features, though they\ncould scarce be termed handsome, expressed sense and acuteness; he bore,\nin his aspect, that ease and composure of manner, equally void of\nawkwardness and affectation, which is said emphatically to mark the\ngentleman; and, although neither the plainness of his dress, nor the\ntotal want of the usual attendants, allowed Meg to suppose him a wealthy\nman, she had little doubt that he was above the rank of her lodgers in\ngeneral. Amidst these observations, and while she was in the course of\nmaking them, the good landlady was embarrassed with various obscure\nrecollections of having seen the object of them formerly; but when, or\non what occasion, she was quite unable to call to remembrance. She was\nparticularly puzzled by the cold and sarcastic expression of a\ncountenance, which she could not by any means reconcile with the\nrecollections which it awakened. At length she said, with as much\ncourtesy as she was capable of assuming,--\"Either I have seen you\nbefore, sir, or some ane very like ye?--Ye ken the Blue room, too, and\nyou a stranger in these parts?\"\n\n\"Not so much a stranger as you may suppose, Meg,\" said the guest,\nassuming a more intimate tone, \"when I call myself Frank Tyrrel.\"\n\n\"Tirl!\" exclaimed Meg, with a tone of wonder--\"It's impossible! You\ncannot be Francie Tirl, the wild callant that was fishing and\nbird-nesting here seven or eight years syne--it canna be--Francie was\nbut a callant!\"\n\n\"But add seven or eight years to that boy's life, Meg,\" said the\nstranger gravely, \"and you will find you have the man who is now before\nyou.\"\n\n\"Even sae!\" said Meg, with a glance at the reflection of her own\ncountenance in the copper coffee-pot, which she had scoured so brightly\nthat it did the office of a mirror--\"Just e'en sae--but folk maun grow\nauld or die.--But, Maister Tirl, for I mauna ca' ye Francie now, I am\nthinking\"----\n\n\"Call me what you please, good dame,\" said the stranger; \"it has been so\nlong since I heard any one call me by a name that sounded like former\nkindness, that such a one is more agreeable to me than a lord's title\nwould be.\"\n\n\"Weel, then, Maister Francie--if it be no offence to you--I hope ye are\nno a Nabob?\"\n\n\"Not I, I can safely assure you, my old friend;--but what an I were?\"\n\n\"Naething--only maybe I might bid ye gang farther, and be waur\nserved.--Nabobs, indeed! the country's plagued wi' them. They have\nraised the price of eggs and pootry for twenty miles round--But what is\nmy business?--They use amaist a' of them the Well down by--they need it,\nye ken, for the clearing of their copper complexions, that need scouring\nas much as my saucepans, that naebody can clean but mysell.\"\n\n\"Well, my good friend,\" said Tyrrel, \"the upshot of all this is, I hope,\nthat I am to stay and have dinner here?\"\n\n\"What for no?\" replied Mrs. Dods.\n\n\"And that I am to have the Blue room for a night or two--perhaps\nlonger?\"\n\n\"I dinna ken that,\" said the dame.--\"The Blue room is the best--and they\nthat get neist best, are no ill aff in this warld.\"\n\n\"Arrange it as you will,\" said the stranger, \"I leave the whole matter\nto you, mistress.--Meantime, I will go see after my horse.\"\n\n\"The merciful man,\" said Meg, when her guest had left the kitchen, \"is\nmerciful to his beast.--He had aye something about him by ordinar, that\ncallant--But eh, sirs! there is a sair change on his cheek-haffit since\nI saw him last!--He sall no want a good dinner for auld lang syne, that\nI'se engage for.\"\n\nMeg set about the necessary preparations with all the natural energy of\nher disposition, which was so much exerted upon her culinary cares, that\nher two maids, on their return to the house, escaped the bitter\nreprimand which she had been previously conning over, in reward for\ntheir alleged slatternly negligence. Nay, so far did she carry her\ncomplaisance, that when Tyrrel crossed the kitchen to recover his\nsaddle-bags, she formally rebuked Eppie for an idle taupie, for not\ncarrying the gentleman's things to his room.\n\n\"I thank you, mistress,\" said Tyrrel; \"but I have some drawings and\ncolours in these saddle-bags, and I always like to carry them myself.\"\n\n\"Ay, and are you at the painting trade yet?\" said Meg; \"an unco slaister\nye used to make with it lang syne.\"\n\n\"I cannot live without it,\" said Tyrrel; and taking the saddle-bags, was\nformally inducted by the maid into a snug apartment, where he soon had\nthe satisfaction to behold a capital dish of minced collops, with\nvegetables, and a jug of excellent ale, placed on the table by the\ncareful hand of Meg herself. He could do no less, in acknowledgment of\nthe honour, than ask Meg for a bottle of the yellow seal, \"if there was\nany of that excellent claret still left.\"\n\n\"Left?--ay is there, walth of it,\" said Meg; \"I dinna gie it to every\nbody--Ah! Maister Tirl, ye have not got ower your auld tricks!--I am\nsure, if ye are painting for your leeving, as you say, a little rum and\nwater would come cheaper, and do ye as much good. But ye maun hae your\nain way the day, nae doubt, if ye should never have it again.\"\n\nAway trudged Meg, her keys clattering as she went, and, after much\nrummaging, returned with such a bottle of claret as no fashionable\ntavern could have produced, were it called for by a duke, or at a duke's\nprice; and she seemed not a little gratified when her guest assured her\nthat he had not yet forgotten its excellent flavour. She retired after\nthese acts of hospitality, and left the stranger to enjoy in quiet the\nexcellent matters which she had placed before him.\n\nBut there was that on Tyrrel's mind which defied the enlivening power of\ngood cheer and of wine, which only maketh man's heart glad when that\nheart has no secret oppression to counteract its influence. Tyrrel found\nhimself on a spot which he had loved in that delightful season, when\nyouth and high spirits awaken all those flattering promises which are so\nill kept to manhood. He drew his chair into the embrasure of the\nold-fashioned window, and throwing up the sash to enjoy the fresh air,\nsuffered his thoughts to return to former days, while his eyes wandered\nover objects which they had not looked upon for several eventful years.\nHe could behold beneath his eye, the lower part of the decayed village,\nas its ruins peeped from the umbrageous shelter with which they were\nshrouded. Still lower down, upon the little holm which formed its\nchurch-yard, was seen the Kirk of Saint Ronan's; and looking yet\nfarther, towards the junction of Saint Ronan's burn with the river which\ntraversed the larger dale or valley, he could see whitened, by the\nwestern sun, the rising houses, which were either newly finished, or in\nthe act of being built, about the medicinal spring.\n\n\"Time changes all around us,\" such was the course of natural though\ntrite reflection, which flowed upon Tyrrel's mind; \"wherefore should\nloves and friendships have a longer date than our dwellings and our\nmonuments?\" As he indulged these sombre recollections, his officious\nlandlady disturbed their tenor by her entrance.\n\n\"I was thinking to offer you a dish of tea, Maister Francie, just for\nthe sake of auld lang syne, and I'll gar the quean Beenie bring it\nhere, and mask it mysell.--But ye arena done with your wine yet?\"\n\n\"I am indeed, Mrs. Dods,\" answered Tyrrel; \"and I beg you will remove\nthe bottle.\"\n\n\"Remove the bottle, and the wine no half drank out!\" said Meg,\ndispleasure lowering on her brow; \"I hope there is nae fault to be found\nwi' the wine, Maister Tirl?\"\n\nTo this answer, which was put in a tone resembling defiance, Tyrrel\nsubmissively replied, by declaring \"the claret not only unexceptionable,\nbut excellent.\"\n\n\"And what for dinna ye drink it, then?\" said Meg, sharply; \"folk should\nnever ask for mair liquor than they can make a gude use of. Maybe ye\nthink we have the fashion of the table-dot, as they ca' their newfangled\nordinary down-by yonder, where a' the bits of vinegar cruets are put awa\ninto an awmry, as they tell me, and ilk ane wi' the bit dribbles of\nsyndings in it, and a paper about the neck o't, to show which of the\ncustomers is aught it--there they stand like doctor's drogs--and no an\nhonest Scottish mutchkin will ane o' their viols haud, granting it were\nat the fouest.\"\n\n\"Perhaps,\" said Tyrrel, willing to indulge the spleen and prejudice of\nhis old acquaintance, \"perhaps the wine is not so good as to make full\nmeasure desirable.\"\n\n\"Ye may say that, lad--and yet them that sell it might afford a gude\npenniworth, for they hae it for the making--maist feck of it ne'er saw\nFrance or Portugal. But as I was saying--this is no ane of their\nnewfangled places, where wine is put by for them that canna drink\nit--when the cork's drawn the bottle maun be drank out--and what for\nno?--unless it be corkit.\"\n\n\"I agree entirely, Meg,\" said her guest; \"but my ride to-day has\nsomewhat heated me--and I think the dish of tea you promise me, will do\nme more good than to finish my bottle.\"\n\n\"Na, then, the best I can do for you is to put it by, to be sauce for\nthe wild-duck the morn; for I think ye said ye were to bide here for a\nday or twa.\"\n\n\"It is my very purpose, Meg, unquestionably,\" replied Tyrrel.\n\n\"Sae be it then,\" said Mrs. Dods; \"and then the liquor's no lost--it has\nbeen seldom sic claret as that has simmered in a saucepan, let me tell\nyou that, neighbour;--and I mind the day, when, headache or nae\nheadache, ye wad hae been at the hinder-end of that bottle, and maybe\nanither, if ye could have gotten it wiled out of me. But then ye had\nyour cousin to help you--Ah! he was a blithe bairn that Valentine\nBulmer!--Ye were a canty callant too, Maister Francie, and muckle ado I\nhad to keep ye baith in order when ye were on the ramble. But ye were a\nthought doucer than Valentine--But O! he was a bonny laddie!--wi' e'en\nlike diamonds, cheeks like roses, a head like a heather-tap--he was the\nfirst I ever saw wear a crap, as they ca' it, but a' body cheats the\nbarber now--and he had a laugh that wad hae raised the dead!--What wi'\nflyting on him, and what wi' laughing at him, there was nae minding ony\nother body when that Valentine was in the house.--And how is your cousin\nValentine Bulmer, Maister Francie?\"\n\nTyrrel looked down, and only answered with a sigh.\n\n\"Ay--and is it even sae?\" said Meg; \"and has the puir bairn been sae\nsoon removed frae this fashious warld?--Ay--ay--we maun a' gang ae\ngate--crackit quart stoups and geisen'd barrels--leaky quaighs are we\na', and canna keep in the liquor of life--Ohon, sirs!--Was the puir lad\nBulmer frae Bu'mer bay, where they land the Hollands, think ye, Maister\nFrancie?--They whiles rin in a pickle tea there too--I hope that is good\nthat I have made you, Maister Francie?\"\n\n\"Excellent, my good dame,\" said Tyrrel; but it was in a tone of voice\nwhich intimated that she had pressed upon a subject that awakened some\nunpleasant reflections.\n\n\"And when did this puir lad die?\" continued Meg, who was not without her\nshare of Eve's qualities, and wished to know something concerning what\nseemed to affect her guest so particularly; but he disappointed her\npurpose, and at the same time awakened another train of sentiment in her\nmind, by turning again to the window, and looking upon the distant\nbuildings of Saint Ronan's Well. As if he had observed for the first\ntime these new objects, he said to Mistress Dods in an indifferent tone,\n\"You have got some gay new neighbours yonder, mistress.\"\n\n\"Neighbours!\" said Meg, her wrath beginning to arise, as it always did\nupon any allusion to this sore subject--\"Ye may ca' them neighbours, if\nye like--but the deil flee awa wi' the neighbourhood for Meg Dods!\"\n\n\"I suppose,\" said Tyrrel, as if he did not observe her displeasure,\n\"that yonder is the Fox Hotel they told me of?\"\n\n\"The Fox!\" said Meg: \"I am sure it is the fox that has carried off a' my\ngeese.--I might shut up house, Maister Francie, if it was the thing I\nlived by--me, that has seen a' our gentlefolk bairns, and gien them\nsnaps and sugar-biscuit maist of them wi' my ain hand! They wad hae seen\nmy father's roof-tree fa' down and smoor me before they wad hae gien a\nboddle a-piece to have propped it up--but they could a' link out their\nfifty pounds ower head to bigg a hottle at the Well yonder. And muckle\nthey hae made o't--the bankrupt body, Sandie Lawson, hasna paid them a\nbawbee of four terms' rent.\"\n\n\"Surely, mistress, I think if the Well became so famous for its cures,\nthe least the gentlemen could have done was to make you the priestess.\"\n\n\"Me priestess! I am nae Quaker, I wot, Maister Francie; and I never\nheard of alewife that turned preacher, except Luckie Buchan in the\nwest.[I-8] And if I were to preach, I think I have mair the spirit of a\nScottishwoman, than to preach in the very room they hae been dancing in\nilka night in the week, Saturday itsell not excepted, and that till twal\no'clock at night. Na, na, Maister Francie; I leave the like o' that to\nMr. Simon Chatterly, as they ca' the bit prelatical sprig of divinity\nfrom the town yonder, that plays at cards, and dances six days in the\nweek, and on the seventh reads the Common Prayer-book in the ball-room,\nwith Tam Simson, the drunken barber, for his clerk.\"\n\n\"I think I have heard of Mr. Chatterly,\" said Tyrrel.\n\n\"Ye'll be thinking o' the sermon he has printed,\" said the angry dame,\n\"where he compares their nasty puddle of a Well yonder to the pool of\nBethseda, like a foul-mouthed, fleeching, feather-headed fule as he is!\nHe should hae kend that the place got a' its fame in the times of black\nPopery; and though they pat it in St. Ronan's name, I'll never believe\nfor one that the honest man had ony hand in it; for I hae been tell'd by\nane that suld ken, that he was nae Roman, but only a Cuddie, or\nCuldee,[I-C] or such like.--But will ye not take anither dish of tea,\nMaister Francie? and a wee bit of the diet-loaf, raised wi' my ain fresh\nbutter, Maister Francie? and no wi' greasy kitchen-fee, like the\nseedcake down at the confectioner's yonder, that has as mony dead flees\nas carvy in it. Set him up for a confectioner!--Wi' a penniworth of\nrye-meal, and anither of tryacle, and twa or three carvy-seeds, I will\nmake better confections than ever cam out of his oven.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt of that, Mrs. Dods,\" said the guest; \"and I only wish\nto know how these new comers were able to establish themselves against a\nhouse of such good reputation and old standing as yours?--It was the\nvirtues of the mineral, I dare say; but how came the waters to recover a\ncharacter all at once, mistress?\"\n\n\"I dinna ken, sir--they used to be thought good for naething, but here\nand there for a puir body's bairn, that had gotten the cruells,[I-9] and\ncould not afford a penniworth of salts. But my Leddy Penelope Penfeather\nhad fa'an ill, it's like, as nae other body ever fell ill, and sae she\nwas to be cured some gate naebody was ever cured, which was naething\nmair than was reasonable--and my leddy, ye ken, has wit at wull, and has\na' the wise folk out from Edinburgh at her house at Windywa's yonder,\nwhich it is her leddyship's wull and pleasure to call Air-castle--and\nthey have a' their different turns, and some can clink verses, wi' their\ntale, as weel as Rob Burns or Allan Ramsay--and some rin up hill and\ndown dale, knapping the chucky stanes to pieces wi' hammers, like sae\nmony road-makers run daft--they say it is to see how the warld was\nmade!--and some that play on all manner of ten-stringed instruments--and\na wheen sketching souls, that ye may see perched like craws on every\ncraig in the country, e'en working at your ain trade, Maister Francie;\nforby men that had been in foreign parts, or said they had been there,\nwhilk is a' ane, ye ken; and maybe twa or three draggletailed misses,\nthat wear my Leddy Penelope's follies when she has dune wi' them, as her\nqueans of maids wear her second-hand claithes. So, after her leddyship's\nhappy recovery, as they ca'd it, down cam the hail tribe of wild-geese,\nand settled by the Well, to dine thereout on the bare grund, like a\nwheen tinklers; and they had sangs, and tunes, and healths, nae doubt,\nin praise of the fountain, as they ca'd the Well, and of Leddy Penelope\nPenfeather; and, lastly, they behoved a' to take a solemn bumper of the\nspring, which, as I'm tauld, made unco havoc amang them or they wan\nhame; and this they ca'd picknick, and a plague to them! And sae the jig\nwas begun after her leddyship's pipe, and mony a mad measure has been\ndanced sin' syne; for down cam masons and murgeon-makers, and preachers\nand player-folk, and Episcopalians and Methodists, and fools and\nfiddlers, and Papists and pie-bakers, and doctors and drugsters; by the\nshop-folk, that sell trash and trumpery at three prices--and so up got\nthe bonny new Well, and down fell the honest auld town of Saint Ronan's,\nwhere blithe decent folk had been heartsome eneugh for mony a day before\nony o' them were born, or ony sic vapouring fancies kittled in their\ncracked brains.\"\n\n\"What said your landlord, the Laird of Saint Ronan's, to all this?\" said\nTyrrel.\n\n\"Is't _my_ landlord ye are asking after, Maister Francie?--the Laird of\nSaint Ronan's is nae landlord of mine, and I think ye might hae minded\nthat.--Na, na, thanks be to Praise! Meg Dods is baith land_lord_ and\nland_leddy_. Ill eneugh to keep the doors open as it is, let be facing\nWhitsunday and Martinmas--an auld leather pock there is, Maister\nFrancie, in ane of worthy Maister Bindloose the sheriff-clerk's\npigeon-holes, in his dowcot of a closet in the burgh; and therein is\nbaith charter and sasine, and special service to boot; and that will be\nchapter and verse, speer when ye list.\"\n\n\"I had quite forgotten,\" said Tyrrel, \"that the inn was your own; though\nI remember you were a considerable landed proprietor.\"\n\n\"Maybe I am,\" replied Meg, \"maybe I am not: and if I be, what for\nno?--But as to what the Laird, whose grandfather was my father's\nlandlord, said to the new doings yonder--he just jumped at the ready\npenny, like a cock at a grosert, and feu'd the bonny holm beside the\nWell, that they ca'd the Saint-Well-holm, that was like the best land in\nhis aught, to be carved, and biggit, and howkit up, just at the pleasure\nof Jock Ashler the stane-mason, that ca's himsell an arkiteck--there's\nnae living for new words in this new warld neither, and that is another\nvex to auld folk such as me.--It's a shame o' the young Laird, to let\nhis auld patrimony gang the gate it's like to gang, and my heart is sair\nto see't, though it has but little cause to care what comes of him or\nhis.\"\n\n\"Is it the same Mr. Mowbray,\" said Mr. Tyrrel, \"who still holds the\nestate?--the old gentleman, you know, whom I had some dispute with\"----\n\n\"About hunting moorfowl upon the Spring-well-head muirs?\" said Meg. \"Ah,\nlad! honest Mr. Bindloose brought you neatly off there--Na, it's no that\nhonest man, but his son John Mowbray--the t'other has slept down-by in\nSaint Ronan's Kirk for these six or seven years.\"\n\n\"Did he leave,\" asked Tyrrel, with something of a faltering voice, \"no\nother child than the present Laird?\"\n\n\"No other son,\" said Meg; \"and there's e'en eneugh, unless he could have\nleft a better ane.\"\n\n\"He died then,\" said Tyrrel, \"excepting this son, without children?\"\n\n\"By your leave, no,\" said Meg; \"there is the lassie Miss Clara, that\nkeeps house for the Laird, if it can be ca'd keeping house, for he is\nalmost aye down at the Well yonder--so a sma' kitchen serves them at the\nShaws.\"\n\n\"Miss Clara will have but a dull time of it there during her brother's\nabsence?\" said the stranger.\n\n\"Out no!--he has her aften jinketing about, and back and forward, wi' a'\nthe fine flichtering fools that come yonder; and clapping palms wi'\nthem, and linking at their dances and daffings. I wuss nae ill come o't,\nbut it's a shame her father's daughter should keep company wi' a' that\nscauff and raff of physic-students, and writers' prentices, and bagmen,\nand siclike trash as are down at the Well yonder.\"\n\n\"You are severe, Mrs. Dods,\" replied the guest. \"No doubt Miss Clara's\nconduct deserves all sort of freedom.\"\n\n\"I am saying naething against her conduct,\" said the dame; \"and there's\nnae ground to say onything that I ken of--But I wad hae like draw to\nlike, Maister Francie. I never quarrelled the ball that the gentry used\nto hae at my bit house a gude wheen years bygane--when they came, the\nauld folk in their coaches, wi' lang-tailed black horses, and a wheen\ngalliard gallants on their hunting horses, and mony a decent leddy\nbehind her ain goodman, and mony a bonny smirking lassie on her pownie,\nand wha sae happy as they--And what for no? And then there was the\nfarmers' ball, wi' the tight lads of yeomen with the bran new blues and\nthe buckskins--These were decent meetings--but then they were a' ae\nman's bairns that were at them, ilk ane kend ilk other--they danced\nfarmers wi' farmers' daughters, at the tane, and gentles wi' gentle\nblood, at the t'other, unless maybe when some of the gentlemen of the\nKillnakelty Club would gie me a round of the floor mysell, in the way of\ndaffing and fun, and me no able to flyte on them for laughing--I am sure\nI never grudged these innocent pleasures, although it has cost me maybe\na week's redding up, before I got the better of the confusion.\"\n\n\"But, dame,\" said Tyrrel, \"this ceremonial would be a little hard upon\nstrangers like myself, for how were we to find partners in these family\nparties of yours?\"\n\n\"Never you fash your thumb about that, Maister Francie,\" returned the\nlandlady, with a knowing wink.--\"Every Jack will find a Jill, gang the\nworld as it may--and, at the warst o't, better hae some fashery in\nfinding a partner for the night, than get yoked with ane that you may\nnot be able to shake off the morn.\"\n\n\"And does that sometimes happen?\" asked the stranger.\n\n\"Happen!--and is't amang the Well folk that ye mean?\" exclaimed the\nhostess. \"Was it not the last season, as they ca't, no farther gane,\nthat young Sir Bingo Binks, the English lad wi' the red coat, that keeps\na mail-coach, and drives it himsell, gat cleekit with Miss Rachel\nBonnyrigg, the auld Leddy Loupengirth's lang-legged daughter--and they\ndanced sae lang thegither, that there was mair said than suld hae been\nsaid about it--and the lad would fain hae louped back, but the auld\nleddy held him to his tackle, and the Commissary Court and somebody else\nmade her Leddy Binks in spite of Sir Bingo's heart--and he has never\ndaured take her to his friends in England, but they have just wintered\nand summered it at the Well ever since--and that is what the Well is\ngood for!\"\n\n\"And does Clara,--I mean does Miss Mowbray, keep company with such women\nas these?\" said Tyrrel, with a tone of interest which he checked as he\nproceeded with the question.\n\n\"What can she do, puir thing?\" said the dame. \"She maun keep the company\nthat her brother keeps, for she is clearly dependent.--But, speaking of\nthat, I ken what I have to do, and that is no little, before it darkens.\nI have sat clavering with you ower lang, Maister Francie.\"\n\nAnd away she marched with a resolved step, and soon the clear octaves of\nher voice were heard in shrill admonition to her handmaidens.\n\nTyrrel paused a moment in deep thought, then took his hat, paid a visit\nto the stable, where his horse saluted him with feathering ears, and\nthat low amicable neigh, with which that animal acknowledges the\napproach of a loving and beloved friend. Having seen that the faithful\ncreature was in every respect attended to, Tyrrel availed himself of the\ncontinued and lingering twilight, to visit the old Castle, which, upon\nformer occasions, had been his favourite evening walk. He remained while\nthe light permitted, admiring the prospect we attempted to describe in\nthe first chapter, and comparing, as in his former reverie, the faded\nhues of the glimmering landscape to those of human life, when early\nyouth and hope have ceased to gild them.\n\nA brisk walk to the inn, and a light supper on a Welsh rabbit and the\ndame's home-brewed, were stimulants of livelier, at least more resigned\nthoughts--and the Blue bedroom, to the honours of which he had been\npromoted, received him a contented, if not a cheerful tenant.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[I-8] The foundress of a sect called Buchanites; a species of Joanna\nSouthcote, who long after death was expected to return and head her\ndisciples on the road to Jerusalem.\n\n[I-9] _Escrouelles_, King's Evil.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nADMINISTRATION.\n\n    There must be government in all society--\n    Bees have their Queen, and stag-herds have their leader;\n    Rome had her Consuls, Athens had her Archons,\n    And we, sir, have our Managing Committee.\n\n_The Album of St. Ronan's._\n\n\nFrancis Tyrrel was, in the course of the next day, formally settled in\nhis old quarters, where he announced his purpose of remaining for\nseveral days. The old-established carrier of the place brought his\nfishing-rod and travelling-trunk, with a letter to Meg, dated a week\npreviously, desiring her to prepare to receive an old acquaintance. This\nannunciation, though something of the latest, Meg received with great\ncomplacency, observing it was a civil attention in Maister Tirl; and\nthat John Hislop, though he was not just sae fast, was far surer than\nony post of them a', or express either. She also observed with\nsatisfaction, that there was no gun-case along with her guest's baggage;\n\"for that weary gunning had brought him and her into trouble--the lairds\nhad cried out upon't, as if she made her house a howff for common\nfowlers and poachers; and yet how could she hinder twa daft hempie\ncallants from taking a start and an ower-loup?[I-10] They had been ower\nthe neighbour's ground they had leave on up to the march, and they\nwerena just to ken meiths when the moorfowl got up.\"\n\nIn a day or two, her guest fell into such quiet and solitary habits,\nthat Meg, herself the most restless and bustling of human creatures,\nbegan to be vexed, for want of the trouble which she expected to have\nhad with him, experiencing, perhaps, the same sort of feeling from his\nextreme and passive indifference on all points, that a good horseman has\nfor the over-patient steed, which he can scarce feel under him. His\nwalks were devoted to the most solitary recesses among the neighbouring\nwoods and hills--his fishing-rod was often left behind him, or carried\nmerely as an apology for sauntering slowly by the banks of some little\nbrooklet--and his success so indifferent, that Meg said the piper of\nPeebles[I-11] would have caught a creelfu' before Maister Francie made out\nthe half-dozen; so that he was obliged, for peace's sake, to vindicate\nhis character, by killing a handsome salmon.\n\nTyrrel's painting, as Meg called it, went on equally slowly: He often,\nindeed, showed her the sketches which he brought from his walks, and\nused to finish at home; but Meg held them very cheap. What signified,\nshe said, a wheen bits of paper, wi' black and white scarts upon them,\nthat he ca'd bushes, and trees, and craigs?--Couldna he paint them wi'\ngreen, and blue, and yellow, like the other folk? \"Ye will never mak\nyour bread that way, Maister Francie. Ye suld munt up a muckle square of\ncanvass, like Dick Tinto, and paint folks ainsells, that they like\nmuckle better to see than ony craig in the haill water; and I wadna\nmuckle objeck even to some of the Wallers coming up and sitting to ye.\nThey waste their time waur, I wis--and, I warrant, ye might make a\nguinea a-head of them. Dick made twa, but he was an auld used hand, and\nfolk maun creep before they gang.\"\n\nIn answer to these remonstrances, Tyrrel assured her, that the sketches\nwith which he busied himself were held of such considerable value, that\nvery often an artist in that line received much higher remuneration for\nthese, than for portraits or coloured drawings. He added, that they were\noften taken for the purpose of illustrating popular poems, and hinted as\nif he himself were engaged in some labour of that nature.\n\nEagerly did Meg long to pour forth to Nelly Trotter, the\nfishwoman,--whose cart formed the only neutral channel of communication\nbetween the Auld Town and the Well, and who was in favour with Meg,\nbecause, as Nelly passed her door in her way to the Well, she always had\nthe first choice of her fish,--the merits of her lodger as an artist.\nLuckie Dods had, in truth, been so much annoyed and bullied, as it were,\nwith the report of clever persons, accomplished in all sorts of\nexcellence, arriving day after day at the Hotel, that she was overjoyed\nin this fortunate opportunity to triumph over them in their own way; and\nit may be believed, that the excellences of her lodger lost nothing by\nbeing trumpeted through her mouth.\n\n\"I maun hae the best of the cart, Nelly--if you and me can gree--for it\nis for ane of the best of painters. Your fine folk down yonder would gie\ntheir lugs to look at what he has been doing--he gets gowd in goupins,\nfor three downright skarts and three cross anes--And he is no an\nungrateful loon, like Dick Tinto, that had nae sooner my good\nfive-and-twenty shillings in his pocket, than he gaed down to birl it\nawa at their bonny hottle yonder, but a decent quiet lad, that kens when\nhe is weel aff, and bides still at the auld howff--And what for\nno?--Tell them all this, and hear what they will say till't.\"\n\n\"Indeed, mistress, I can tell ye that already, without stirring my\nshanks for the matter,\" answered Nelly Trotter; \"they will e'en say that\nye are ae auld fule, and me anither, that may hae some judgment in\ncock-bree or in scate-rumples, but mauna fash our beards about ony thing\nelse.\"\n\n\"Wad they say sae, the frontless villains! and me been a housekeeper\nthis thirty year!\" exclaimed Meg; \"I wadna hae them say it to my face!\nBut I am no speaking without warrant--for what an I had spoken to the\nminister, lass, and shown him ane of the loose skarts of paper that\nMaister Tirl leaves fleeing about his room?--and what an he had said he\nhad kend Lord Bidmore gie five guineas for the waur on't? and a' the\nwarld kens he was lang tutor in the Bidmore family.\"\n\n\"Troth,\" answered her gossip, \"I doubt if I was to tell a' this they\nwould hardly believe me, mistress; for there are sae mony judges amang\nthem, and they think sae muckle of themsells, and sae little of other\nfolk, that unless ye were to send down the bit picture, I am no thinking\nthey will believe a word that I can tell them.\"\n\n\"No believe what an honest woman says--let abee to say twa o' them?\"\nexclaimed Meg; \"O the unbelieving generation!--Weel, Nelly, since my\nback is up, ye sall tak down the picture, or sketching, or whatever it\nis, (though I thought sketchers[I-12] were aye made of airn,) and shame\nwi' it the conceited crew that they are.--But see and bring't back wi'\nye again, Nelly, for it's a thing of value; and trustna it out o' your\nhand, _that_ I charge you, for I lippen no muckle to their\nhonesty.--And, Nelly, ye may tell them he has an illustrated\npoem--_illustrated_--mind the word, Nelly--that is to be stuck as fou o'\nthe like o' that, as ever turkey was larded wi' dabs o' bacon.\"\n\nThus furnished with her credentials, and acting the part of a herald\nbetwixt two hostile countries, honest Nelly switched her little\nfish-cart downwards to St. Ronan's Well.\n\nIn watering-places, as in other congregated assemblies of the human\nspecies, various kinds of government have been dictated, by chance,\ncaprice, or convenience; but in almost all of them, some sort of\ndirection has been adopted, to prevent the consequences of anarchy.\nSometimes the sole power has been vested in a Master of Ceremonies; but\nthis, like other despotisms, has been of late unfashionable, and the\npowers of this great officer have been much limited even at Bath, where\nNash once ruled with undisputed supremacy. Committees of management,\nchosen from among the most steady guests, have been in general resorted\nto, as a more liberal mode of sway, and to such was confided the\nadministration of the infant republic of St. Ronan's Well. This little\nsenate, it must be observed, had the more difficult task in discharging\ntheir high duties, that, like those of other republics, their subjects\nwere divided into two jarring and contending factions, who every day\neat, drank, danced, and made merry together, hating each other all the\nwhile with all the animosity of political party, endeavouring by every\nart to secure the adherence of each guest who arrived, and ridiculing\nthe absurdities and follies of each other, with all the wit and\nbitterness of which they were masters.\n\nAt the head of one of these parties was no less a personage than Lady\nPenelope Penfeather, to whom the establishment owed its fame, nay, its\nexistence; and whose influence could only have been balanced by that of\nthe Lord of the Manor, Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's, or, as he was called\nusually by the company who affected what Meg called knapping English,\nThe Squire, who was leader of the opposite faction.\n\nThe rank and fortune of the lady, her pretensions to beauty as well as\ntalent, (though the former was something faded,) and the consequence\nwhich she arrogated to herself as a woman of fashion, drew round her\npainters and poets, and philosophers, and men of science, and lecturers,\nand foreign adventurers, _et hoc genus omne_.\n\nOn the contrary, the Squire's influence, as a man of family and property\nin the immediate neighbourhood, who actually kept greyhounds and\npointers, and at least talked of hunters and of racers, ascertained him\nthe support of the whole class of bucks, half and whole bred, from the\nthree next counties; and if more inducements were wanting, he could\ngrant his favourites the privilege of shooting over his moors, which is\nenough to turn the head of a young Scottishman at any time. Mr. Mowbray\nwas of late especially supported in his pre-eminence, by a close\nalliance with Sir Bingo Binks, a sapient English Baronet, who, ashamed,\nas many thought, to return to his own country, had set him down at the\nWell of St. Ronan's, to enjoy the blessing which the Caledonian Hymen\nhad so kindly forced on him in the person of Miss Rachel Bonnyrigg. As\nthis gentleman actually drove a regular-built mail-coach, not in any\nrespect differing from that of his Majesty, only that it was more\nfrequently overturned, his influence with a certain set was\nirresistible, and the Squire of St. Ronan's, having the better sense of\nthe two, contrived to reap the full benefit of the consequence attached\nto his friendship.\n\nThese two contending parties were so equally balanced, that the\npredominance of the influence of either was often determined by the\ncourse of the sun. Thus, in the morning and forenoon, when Lady Penelope\nled forth her herd to lawn and shady bower, whether to visit some ruined\nmonument of ancient times, or eat their pic-nic luncheon, to spoil good\npaper with bad drawings, and good verses with repetition--in a word,\n\n    \"To rave, recite, and madden round the land,\"\n\nher ladyship's empire over the loungers seemed uncontrolled and\nabsolute, and all things were engaged in the _tourbillon_, of which she\nformed the pivot and centre. Even the hunters, and shooters, and hard\ndrinkers, were sometimes fain reluctantly to follow in her train,\nsulking, and quizzing, and flouting at her solemn festivals, besides\nencouraging the younger nymphs to giggle when they should have looked\nsentimental. But after dinner the scene was changed, and her ladyship's\nsweetest smiles, and softest invitations, were often insufficient to\ndraw the neutral part of the company to the tea-room; so that her\nsociety was reduced to those whose constitution or finances rendered\nearly retirement from the dining-parlour a matter of convenience,\ntogether with the more devoted and zealous of her own immediate\ndependents and adherents. Even the faith of the latter was apt to be\ndebauched. Her ladyship's poet-laureate, in whose behalf she was teazing\neach new-comer for subscriptions, got sufficiently independent to sing\nin her ladyship's presence, at supper, a song of rather equivocal\nmeaning; and her chief painter, who was employed upon an illustrated\ncopy of the Loves of the Plants, was, at another time, seduced into such\na state of pot-valour, that, upon her ladyship's administering her usual\ndose of criticism upon his works, he not only bluntly disputed her\njudgment, but talked something of his right to be treated like a\ngentleman.\n\nThese feuds were taken up by the Managing Committee, who interceded for\nthe penitent offenders on the following morning, and obtained their\nre-establishment in Lady Penelope's good graces, upon moderate terms.\nMany other acts of moderating authority they performed, much to the\nassuaging of faction, and the quiet of the Wellers; and so essential was\ntheir government to the prosperity of the place, that, without them, St.\nRonan's spring would probably have been speedily deserted. We must,\ntherefore, give a brief sketch of that potential Committee, which both\nfactions, acting as if on a self-denying ordinance, had combined to\ninvest with the reins of government.\n\nEach of its members appeared to be selected, as Fortunio, in the\nfairy-tale,[I-D] chose his followers, for his peculiar gifts. First on the\nlist stood the MAN OF MEDICINE, Dr. Quentin Quackleben, who claimed\nright to regulate medical matters at the spring, upon the principle\nwhich, of old, assigned the property of a newly discovered country to\nthe bucanier who committed the earliest piracy on its shores. The\nacknowledgment of the Doctor's merit as having been first to proclaim\nand vindicate the merits of these healing fountains, had occasioned his\nbeing universally installed First Physician and Man of Science, which\nlast qualification he could apply to all purposes, from the boiling of\nan egg to the giving a lecture. He was, indeed, qualified, like many of\nhis profession, to spread both the bane and antidote before a dyspeptic\npatient, being as knowing a gastronome as Dr. Redgill himself, or any\nother worthy physician who has written for the benefit of the _cuisine_,\nfrom Dr. Moncrieff of Tippermalloch, to the late Dr. Hunter of York, and\nthe present Dr. Kitchiner of London. But pluralities are always\ninvidious, and therefore the Doctor prudently relinquished the office of\ncaterer and head-carver to the Man of Taste, who occupied regularly, and\n_ex officio_, the head of the table, reserving to himself the occasional\nprivilege of criticising, and a principal share in consuming, the good\nthings which the common entertainment afforded. We have only to sum up\nthis brief account of the learned Doctor, by informing the reader that\nhe was a tall, lean, beetle-browed man, with an ill-made black\nscratch-wig, that stared out on either side from his lantern jaws. He\nresided nine months out of the twelve at St. Ronan's, and was supposed\nto make an indifferent good thing of it,--especially as he played whist\nto admiration.\n\nFirst in place, though perhaps second to the Doctor in real authority,\nwas Mr. Winterblossom; a civil sort of person, who was nicely precise in\nhis address, wore his hair cued, and dressed with powder, had\nknee-buckles set with Bristol stones, and a seal-ring as large as Sir\nJohn Falstaff's. In his heyday he had a small estate, which he had spent\nlike a gentleman, by mixing with the gay world. He was, in short, one of\nthose respectable links that connect the coxcombs of the present day\nwith those of the last age, and could compare, in his own experience,\nthe follies of both. In latter days, he had sense enough to extricate\nhimself from his course of dissipation, though with impaired health and\nimpoverished fortune.\n\nMr. Winterblossom now lived upon a moderate annuity, and had discovered\na way of reconciling his economy with much company and made dishes, by\nacting as perpetual president of the table-d'hote at the Well. Here he\nused to amuse the society by telling stories about Garrick, Foote,\nBonnel Thornton, and Lord Kelly, and delivering his opinions in matters\nof taste and vertu. An excellent carver, he knew how to help each guest\nto what was precisely his due; and never failed to reserve a proper\nslice as the reward of his own labours. To conclude, he was possessed of\nsome taste in the fine arts, at least in painting and music, although it\nwas rather of the technical kind, than that which warms the heart and\nelevates the feelings. There was, indeed, about Winterblossom, nothing\nthat was either warm or elevated. He was shrewd, selfish, and sensual;\nthe last two of which qualities he screened from observation, under a\nspecious varnish of exterior complaisance. Therefore, in his professed\nand apparent anxiety to do the honours of the table, to the most\npunctilious point of good breeding, he never permitted the attendants\nupon the public taste to supply the wants of others, until all his own\nprivate comforts had been fully arranged and provided for.\n\nMr. Winterblossom was also distinguished for possessing a few curious\nengravings, and other specimens of art, with the exhibition of which he\noccasionally beguiled a wet morning at the public room. They were\ncollected, \"_viis et modis_,\" said the Man of Law, another distinguished\nmember of the Committee, with a knowing cock of his eye to his next\nneighbour.\n\nOf this person little need be said. He was a large-boned, loud-voiced,\nred-faced man, named Meiklewham; a country writer, or attorney, who\nmanaged the matters of the Squire much to the profit of one or\nother,--if not of both. His nose projected from the front of his broad\nvulgar face, like the stile of an old sun-dial, twisted all of one side.\nHe was as great a bully in his profession, as if it had been military\ninstead of civil: conducted the whole technicalities concerning the\ncutting up the Saint's-Well-haugh, so much lamented by Dame Dods, into\nbuilding-stances, and was on excellent terms with Doctor Quackleben, who\nalways recommended him to make the wills of his patients.\n\nAfter the Man of Law comes Captain Mungo MacTurk, a Highland lieutenant\non half-pay, and that of ancient standing; one who preferred toddy of\nthe strongest to wine, and in that fashion and cold drams finished about\na bottle of whisky _per diem_, whenever he could come by it. He was\ncalled the Man of Peace, on the same principle which assigns to\nconstables, Bow-street runners, and such like, who carry bludgeons to\nbreak folk's heads, and are perpetually and officially employed in\nscenes of riot, the title of peace-officers--that is, because by his\nvalour he compelled others to act with discretion. The Captain was the\ngeneral referee in all those abortive quarrels, which, at a place of\nthis kind, are so apt to occur at night, and to be quietly settled in\nthe morning; and occasionally adopted a quarrel himself, by way of\ntaking down any guest who was unusually pugnacious. This occupation\nprocured Captain MacTurk a good deal of respect at the Well; for he was\nprecisely that sort of person who is ready to fight with any one,--whom\nno one can find an apology for declining to fight with,--in fighting\nwith whom considerable danger was incurred, for he was ever and anon\nshowing that he could snuff a candle with a pistol ball,--and lastly,\nthrough fighting with whom no eclat or credit could redound to the\nantagonist. He always wore a blue coat and red collar, had a\nsupercilious taciturnity of manner, ate sliced leeks with his cheese,\nand resembled in complexion a Dutch red-herring.\n\nStill remains to be mentioned the Man of Religion--the gentle Mr. Simon\nChatterly, who had strayed to St. Ronan's Well from the banks of Cam or\nIsis, and who piqued himself, first on his Greek, and secondly, on his\npoliteness to the ladies. During all the week days, as Dame Dods has\nalready hinted, this reverend gentleman was the partner at the\nwhist-table, or in the ball-room, to what maid or matron soever lacked a\npartner at either; and on the Sundays, he read prayers in the public\nroom to all who chose to attend. He was also a deviser of charades, and\nan unriddler of riddles; he played a little on the flute, and was Mr.\nWinterblossom's principal assistant in contriving those ingenious and\nromantic paths, by which, as by the zig-zags which connect military\nparallels, you were enabled to ascend to the top of the hill behind the\nhotel, which commands so beautiful a prospect, at exactly that precise\nangle of ascent, which entitles a gentleman to offer his arm, and a lady\nto accept it, with perfect propriety.\n\nThere was yet another member of this Select Committee, Mr. Michael\nMeredith, who might be termed the Man of Mirth, or, if you please, the\nJack Pudding to the company, whose business it was to crack the best\njoke, and sing the best song,--he could. Unluckily, however, this\nfunctionary was for the present obliged to absent himself from St.\nRonan's; for, not recollecting that he did not actually wear the\nprivileged motley of his profession, he had passed some jest upon\nCaptain MacTurk, which cut so much to the quick, that Mr. Meredith was\nfain to go to goat-whey quarters, at some ten miles' distance, and\nremain there in a sort of concealment, until the affair should be made\nup through the mediation of his brethren of the Committee.\n\nSuch were the honest gentlemen who managed the affairs of this rising\nsettlement, with as much impartiality as could be expected. They were\nnot indeed without their own secret predilections; for the lawyer and\nthe soldier privately inclined to the party of the Squire, while the\nparson, Mr. Meredith, and Mr. Winterblossom, were more devoted to the\ninterests of Lady Penelope; so that Doctor Quackleben alone, who\nprobably recollected that the gentlemen were as liable to stomach\ncomplaints, as the ladies to nervous disorders, seemed the only person\nwho preserved in word and deed the most rigid neutrality. Nevertheless,\nthe interests of the establishment being very much at the heart of this\nhonourable council, and each feeling his own profit, pleasure, or\ncomfort, in some degree involved, they suffered not their private\naffections to interfere with their public duties, but acted, every one\nin his own sphere, for the public benefit of the whole community.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[I-10] The usual expression for a slight encroachment on a neighbour's\nproperty.\n\n[I-11] The said piper was famous at the mystery.\n\n[I-12] Skates are called sketchers in Scotland.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE INVITATION.\n\n    Thus painters write their names at Co.\n\nPRIOR.\n\n\nThe clamour which attends the removal of dinner from a public room had\nsubsided; the clatter of plates, and knives and forks--the bustling\ntread of awkward boobies of country servants, kicking each other's\nshins, and wrangling, as they endeavour to rush out of the door three\nabreast--the clash of glasses and tumblers, borne to earth in the\ntumult--the shrieks of the landlady--the curses, not loud, but deep, of\nthe landlord--had all passed away; and those of the company who had\nservants, had been accommodated by their respective Ganymedes with such\nremnants of their respective bottles of wine, spirits, &c., as the said\nGanymedes had not previously consumed, while the rest, broken in to such\nobservance by Mr. Winterblossom, waited patiently until the worthy\npresident's own special and multifarious commissions had been executed\nby a tidy young woman and a lumpish lad, the regular attendants\nbelonging to the house, but whom he permitted to wait on no one, till,\nas the hymn says,\n\n    \"All his wants were well supplied.\"\n\n\"And, Dinah--my bottle of pale sherry, Dinah--place it on this\nside--there's a good girl;--and, Toby--get my jug with the hot\nwater--and let it be boiling--and don't spill it on Lady Penelope, if\nyou can help it, Toby.\"\n\n\"No--for her ladyship has been in hot water to-day already,\" said the\nSquire; a sarcasm to which Lady Penelope only replied with a look of\ncontempt.\n\n\"And, Dinah, bring the sugar--the soft East India sugar, Dinah--and a\nlemon, Dinah, one of those which came fresh to-day--Go fetch it from the\nbar, Toby--and don't tumble down stairs, if you can help it.--And,\nDinah--stay, Dinah--the nutmeg, Dinah, and the ginger, my good\ngirl--And, Dinah--put the cushion up behind my back--and the footstool\nto my foot, for my toe is something the worse of my walk with your\nladyship this morning to the top of Belvidere.\"\n\n\"Her ladyship may call it what she pleases in common parlance,\" said the\nwriter; \"but it must stand Munt-grunzie in the stamped paper, being so\nnominated in the ancient writs and evidents thereof.\"\n\n\"And, Dinah,\" continued the president, \"lift up my handkerchief--and--a\nbit of biscuit, Dinah--and--and I do not think I want any thing\nelse--Look to the company, my good girl.--I have the honour to drink the\ncompany's very good health--Will your ladyship honour me by accepting a\nglass of negus?--I learned to make negus from old Dartineuf's son.--He\nalways used East India sugar and added a tamarind--it improves the\nflavour infinitely.--Dinah, see your father sends for some\ntamarinds--Dartineuf knew a good thing almost as well as his father--I\nmet him at Bath in the year--let me see--Garrick was just taking leave,\nand that was in,\" &c. &c. &c.--\"And what is this now, Dinah?\" he said,\nas she put into his hand a roll of paper.\n\n\"Something that Nelly Trotter\" (Trotting Nelly, as the company called\nher) \"brought from a sketching gentleman that lives at the woman's\"\n(thus bluntly did the upstart minx describe the reverend Mrs. Margaret\nDods) \"at the Cleikum of Aultoun yonder\"--A name, by the way, which the\ninn had acquired from the use which the saint upon the sign-post was\nmaking of his pastoral crook.\n\n\"Indeed, Dinah?\" said Mr. Winterblossom, gravely taking out his\nspectacles, and wiping them before he opened the roll of paper; \"some\nboy's daubing, I suppose, whose pa and ma wish to get him into the\nTrustees' School, and so are beating about for a little interest.--But I\nam drained dry--I put three lads in last season; and if it had not been\nmy particular interest with the secretary, who asks my opinion now and\nthen, I could not have managed it. But giff-gaff, say I.--Eh! What, in\nthe devil's name, is this?--Here is both force and keeping--Who can this\nbe, my lady?--Do but see the sky-line--why, this is really a little\nbit--an exquisite little bit--Who the devil can it be? and how can he\nhave stumbled upon the dog-hole in the Old Town, and the snarling b----I\nbeg your ladyship ten thousand pardons--that kennels there?\"\n\n\"I dare say, my lady,\" said a little miss of fourteen, her eyes growing\nrounder and rounder, and her cheeks redder and redder, as she found\nherself speaking, and so many folks listening--\"O la! I dare say it is\nthe same gentleman we met one day in the Low-wood walk, that looked like\na gentleman, and yet was none of the company, and that you said was a\nhandsome man.\"\n\n\"I did not say handsome, Maria,\" replied her ladyship; \"ladies never say\nmen are handsome--I only said he looked genteel and interesting.\"\n\n\"And that, my lady,\" said the young parson, bowing and smiling, \"is, I\nwill be judged by the company, the more flattering compliment of the\ntwo--We shall be jealous of this Unknown presently.\"\n\n\"Nay, but,\" continued the sweetly communicative Maria, with some real\nand some assumed simplicity, \"your ladyship forgets--for you said\npresently after, you were sure he was no gentleman, for he did not run\nafter you with your glove which you had dropped--and so I went back\nmyself to find your ladyship's glove, and he never offered to help me,\nand I saw him closer than your ladyship did, and I am sure he is\nhandsome, though he is not very civil.\"\n\n\"You speak a little too much and too loud, miss,\" said Lady Penelope, a\nnatural blush reinforcing the _nuance_ of rouge by which it was usually\nsuperseded.\n\n\"What say you to that, Squire Mowbray?\" said the elegant Sir Bingo\nBinks.\n\n\"A fair challenge to the field, Sir Bingo,\" answered the squire; \"when a\nlady throws down the gauntlet, a gentleman may throw the handkerchief.\"\n\n\"I have always the benefit of _your_ best construction, Mr. Mowbray,\"\nsaid the lady, with dignity. \"I suppose Miss Maria has contrived this\npretty story for your amusement. I can hardly answer to Mr. Digges, for\nbringing her into company where she receives encouragement to behave\nso.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, my lady,\" said the president, \"you must let the jest pass by;\nand since this is really such an admirable sketch, you must honour us\nwith your opinion, whether the company can consistently with propriety\nmake any advances to this man.\"\n\n\"In my opinion,\" said her ladyship, the angry spot still glowing on her\nbrow, \"there are enough of _men_ among us already--I wish I could say\ngentlemen--As matters stand, I see little business _ladies_ can have at\nSt. Ronan's.\"\n\nThis was an intimation which always brought the Squire back to\ngood-breeding, which he could make use of when he pleased. He deprecated\nher ladyship's displeasure, until she told him, in returning good\nhumour, that she really would not trust him unless he brought his sister\nto be security for his future politeness.\n\n\"Clara, my lady,\" said Mowbray, \"is a little wilful; and I believe your\nladyship must take the task of unharbouring her into your own hands.\nWhat say you to a gipsy party up to my old shop?--It is a bachelor's\nhouse--you must not expect things in much order; but Clara would be\nhonoured\"----\n\nThe Lady Penelope eagerly accepted the proposal of something like a\nparty, and, quite reconciled with Mowbray, began to enquire whether she\nmight bring the stranger artist with her; \"that is,\" said her ladyship,\nlooking to Dinah, \"if he be a gentleman.\"\n\nHere Dinah interposed her assurance, \"that the gentleman at Meg Dods's\nwas quite and clean a gentleman, and an illustrated poet besides.\"\n\n\"An illustrated poet, Dinah?\" said Lady Penelope; \"you must mean an\nillustrious poet.\"\n\n\"I dare to say your ladyship is right,\" said Dinah, dropping a curtsy.\n\nA joyous flutter of impatient anxiety was instantly excited through all\nthe blue-stocking faction of the company, nor were the news totally\nindifferent to the rest of the community. The former belonged to that\nclass, who, like the young Ascanius, are ever beating about in quest of\na tawny lion, though they are much more successful in now and then\nstarting a great bore;[I-13] and the others, having left all their own\nordinary affairs and subjects of interest at home, were glad to make a\nmatter of importance of the most trivial occurrence. A mighty poet, said\nthe former class--who could it possibly be?--All names were recited--all\nBritain scrutinized, from Highland hills to the Lakes of\nCumberland--from Sydenham Common to St. James's Place--even the Banks of\nthe Bosphorus were explored for some name which might rank under this\ndistinguished epithet.--And then, besides his illustrious poesy, to\nsketch so inimitably!--who _could_ it be? And all the gapers, who had\nnothing of their own to suggest, answered with the antistrophe, \"Who\ncould it be?\"\n\nThe Claret-Club, which comprised the choicest and firmest adherents of\nSquire Mowbray and the Baronet--men who scorned that the reversion of\none bottle of wine should furnish forth the feast of to-morrow, though\ncaring nought about either of the fine arts in question, found out an\ninterest of their own, which centred in the same individual.\n\n\"I say, little Sir Bingo,\" said the Squire, \"this is the very fellow\nthat we saw down at the Willow-slack on Saturday--he was tog'd\ngnostically enough, and cast twelve yards of line with one hand--the fly\nfell like a thistledown on the water.\"\n\n\"Uich!\" answered the party he addressed, in the accents of a dog choking\nin the collar.\n\n\"We saw him pull out the salmon yonder,\" said Mowbray; \"you\nremember--clean fish--the tide-ticks on his gills--weighed, I dare say,\na matter of eighteen pounds.\"\n\n\"Sixteen!\" replied Sir Bingo, in the same tone of strangulation.\n\n\"None of your rigs, Bing!\" said his companion, \"--nearer eighteen than\nsixteen!\"\n\n\"Nearer sixteen, by ----!\"\n\n\"Will you go a dozen of blue on it to the company?\" said the Squire.\n\n\"No, d---- me!\" croaked the Baronet--\"to our own set I will.\"\n\n\"Then, I say done!\" quoth the Squire.\n\nAnd \"Done!\" responded the Knight; and out came their red pocketbooks.\n\n\"But who shall decide the bet?\" said the Squire, \"The genius himself, I\nsuppose; they talk of asking him here, but I suppose he will scarce mind\nquizzes like them.\"\n\n\"Write myself--John Mowbray,\" said the Baronet.\n\n\"You, Baronet!--you write!\" answered the Squire, \"d---- me, that cock\nwon't fight--you won't.\"\n\n\"I will,\" growled Sir Bingo, more articulately than usual.\n\n\"Why, you can't!\" said Mowbray. \"You never wrote a line in your life,\nsave those you were whipped for at school.\"\n\n\"I can write--I will write!\" said Sir Bingo. \"Two to one I will.\"\n\nAnd there the affair rested, for the council of the company were in high\nconsultation concerning the most proper manner of opening a\ncommunication with the mysterious stranger; and the voice of Mr.\nWinterblossom, whose tones, originally fine, age had reduced to\nfalsetto, was calling upon the whole party for \"Order, order!\" So that\nthe bucks were obliged to lounge in silence, with both arms reclined on\nthe table, and testifying, by coughs and yawns, their indifference to\nthe matters in question, while the rest of the company debated upon\nthem, as if they were matters of life and death.\n\n\"A visit from one of the gentlemen--Mr. Winterblossom, if he would take\nthe trouble--in name of the company at large--would, Lady Penelope\nPenfeather presumed to think, be a necessary preliminary to an\ninvitation.\"\n\nMr. Winterblossom was \"quite of her ladyship's opinion, and would gladly\nhave been the personal representative of the company at St. Ronan's\nWell--but it was up hill--her ladyship knew his tyrant, the gout, was\nhovering upon the frontiers--there were other gentlemen, younger and\nmore worthy to fly at the lady's command than an ancient Vulcan like\nhim--there was the valiant Mars and the eloquent Mercury.\"\n\nThus speaking, he bowed to Captain MacTurk and the Rev. Mr. Simon\nChatterly, and reclined on his chair, sipping his negus with the\nself-satisfied smile of one, who, by a pretty speech, has rid himself\nof a troublesome commission. At the same time, by an act probably of\nmental absence, he put in his pocket the drawing, which, after\ncirculating around the table, had returned back to the chair of the\npresident, being the point from which it had set out.\n\n\"By Cot, madam,\" said Captain MacTurk, \"I should be proud to obey your\nleddyship's commands--but, by Cot, I never call first on any man that\nnever called upon me at all, unless it were to carry him a friend's\nmessage, or such like.\"\n\n\"Twig the old connoisseur,\" said the Squire to the Knight.--\"He is\ncondiddling the drawing.\"\n\n\"Go it, Johnnie Mowbray--pour it into him,\" whispered Sir Bingo.\n\n\"Thank ye for nothing, Sir Bingo,\" said the Squire, in the same tone.\n\"Winterblossom is one of us--_was_ one of us at least--and won't stand\nthe ironing. He has his Wogdens still, that were right things in his\nday, and can hit the hay-stack with the best of us--but stay, they are\nhallooing on the parson.\"\n\nThey were indeed busied on all hands, to obtain Mr. Chatterly's consent\nto wait on the Genius unknown; but though he smiled and simpered, and\nwas absolutely incapable of saying No, he begged leave, in all humility,\nto decline that commission. \"The truth was,\" he pleaded in his excuse,\n\"that having one day walked to visit the old Castle of St. Ronan's, and\nreturning through the Auld Town, as it was popularly called, he had\nstopped at the door of the _Cleikum_,\" (pronounced _Anglic\u00c3\u00a9_, with the\nopen diphthong,) \"in hopes to get a glass of syrup of capillaire, or a\ndraught of something cooling; and had in fact expressed his wishes, and\nwas knocking pretty loudly, when a sash-window was thrown suddenly up,\nand ere he was aware what was about to happen, he was soused with a\ndeluge of water,\" (as he said,) \"while the voice of an old hag from\nwithin assured him, that if that did not cool him there was another\nbiding him,--an intimation which induced him to retreat in all haste\nfrom the repetition of the shower-bath.\"\n\nAll laughed at the account of the chaplain's misfortune, the history of\nwhich seemed to be wrung from him reluctantly, by the necessity of\nassigning some weighty cause for declining to execute the ladies'\ncommands. But the Squire and Baronet continued their mirth far longer\nthan decorum allowed, flinging themselves back in their chairs, with\ntheir hands thrust into their side-pockets, and their mouths expanded\nwith unrestrained enjoyment, until the sufferer, angry, disconcerted,\nand endeavouring to look scornful, incurred another general burst of\nlaughter on all hands.\n\nWhen Mr. Winterblossom had succeeded in restoring some degree of order,\nhe found the mishaps of the young divine proved as intimidating as\nludicrous. Not one of the company chose to go Envoy Extraordinary to the\ndominions of Queen Meg, who might be suspected of paying little respect\nto the sanctity of an ambassador's person. And what was worse, when it\nwas resolved that a civil card from Mr. Winterblossom, in the name of\nthe company, should be sent to the stranger, instead of a personal\nvisit, Dinah informed them that she was sure no one about the house\ncould be bribed to carry up a letter of the kind; for, when such an\nevent had taken place two summers since, Meg, who construed it into an\nattempt to seduce from her tenement the invited guest, had so handled a\nploughboy who carried the letter, that he fled the country-side\naltogether, and never thought himself safe till he was at a village ten\nmiles off, where it was afterwards learned he enlisted with a recruiting\nparty, choosing rather to face the French than to return within the\nsphere of Meg's displeasure.\n\nJust while they were agitating this new difficulty, a prodigious clamour\nwas heard without, which, to the first apprehensions of the company,\nseemed to be Meg, in all her terrors, come to anticipate the proposed\ninvasion. Upon enquiry, however, it proved to be her gossip, Trotting\nNelly, or Nelly Trotter, in the act of forcing her way up stairs,\nagainst the united strength of the whole household of the hotel, to\nreclaim Luckie Dods's picture, as she called it. This made the\nconnoisseur's treasure tremble in his pocket, who, thrusting a\nhalf-crown into Toby's hand, exhorted him to give it her, and try his\ninfluence in keeping her back. Toby, who knew Nelly's nature, put the\nhalf-crown into his own pocket, and snatched up a gill-stoup of whisky\nfrom the sideboard. Thus armed, he boldly confronted the virago, and\ninterposing a _remora_, which was able to check poor Nelly's course in\nher most determined moods, not only succeeded in averting the immediate\nstorm which approached the company in general, and Mr. Winterblossom in\nparticular, but brought the guests the satisfactory information, that\nTrotting Nelly had agreed, after she had slept out her nap in the barn,\nto convey their commands to the Unknown of Cleikum of Aultoun.\n\nMr. Winterblossom, therefore, having authenticated his proceedings, by\ninserting in the Minutes of the Committee, the authority which he had\nreceived, wrote his card in the best style of diplomacy, and sealed it\nwith the seal of the Spa, which bore something like a nymph, seated\nbeside what was designed to represent an urn.\n\nThe rival factions, however, did not trust entirely to this official\ninvitation. Lady Penelope was of opinion that they should find some way\nof letting the stranger--a man of talent unquestionably--understand that\nthere were in the society to which he was invited, spirits of a more\nselect sort, who felt worthy to intrude themselves on his solitude.\n\nAccordingly, her ladyship imposed upon the elegant Mr. Chatterly the\ntask of expressing the desire of the company to see the unknown artist,\nin a neat occasional copy of verses. The poor gentleman's muse, however,\nproved unpropitious; for he was able to proceed no farther than two\nlines in half an hour, which, coupled with its variations, we insert\nfrom the blotted manuscript, as Dr. Johnson has printed the alterations\nin Pope's version of the Iliad:\n\n    1. _Maids._ 2. _Dames._ unity joining.\n    The [nymphs] of St. Ronan's [in purpose combining]\n\n    1. _Swain._ 2. _Man._\n    To the [youth] who is great both in verse and designing,\n    ......... dining.\n\nThe eloquence of a prose billet was necessarily resorted to in the\nabsence of the heavenly muse, and the said billet was secretly intrusted\nto the care of Trotting Nelly. The same trusty emissary, when refreshed\nby her nap among the pease-straw, and about to harness her cart for her\nreturn to the seacoast, (in the course of which she was to pass the\nAultoun,) received another card, written, as he had threatened, by Sir\nBingo Binks himself, who had given himself this trouble to secure the\nsettlement of the bet; conjecturing that a man with a fashionable\nexterior, who could throw twelve yards of line at a cast with such\nprecision, might consider the invitation of Winterblossom as that of an\nold twaddler, and care as little for the good graces of an affected\nblue-stocking and her _c\u00c3\u00b4terie_, whose conversation, in Sir Bingo's\nmind, relished of nothing but of weak tea and bread and butter. Thus the\nhappy Mr. Francis Tyrrel received, considerably to his surprise, no less\nthan three invitations at once from the Well of St. Ronan's.\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[I-13] The one or the other was equally _in votis_ to Ascanius,--\n\n    \"Optat aprum, aut fulvum descendere monte leonem.\"\n\nModern Trojans make a great distinction betwixt these two objects of\nchase.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nEPISTOLARY ELOQUENCE.\n\n    But how can I answer, since first I must read thee?\n\nPRIOR.\n\n\nDesirous of authenticating our more important facts, by as many original\ndocuments as possible, we have, after much research, enabled ourselves\nto present the reader with the following accurate transcripts of the\nnotes intrusted to the care of Trotting Nelly. The first ran thus:\n\n    \"Mr. Winterblossom [of Silverhed] has the commands of Lady Penelope\n    Penfeather, Sir Bingo and Lady Binks, Mr. and Miss Mowbray [of St.\n    Ronan's], and the rest of the company at the Hotel and Tontine Inn\n    of St. Ronan's Well, to express their hope that the gentleman lodged\n    at the Cleikum Inn, Old Town of St. Ronan's, will favour them with\n    his company at the Ordinary, as early and as often as may suit his\n    convenience. The COMPANY think it necessary to send this intimation,\n    because, according to the RULES of the place, the Ordinary can only\n    be attended by such gentlemen and ladies as lodge at St. Ronan's\n    Well; but they are happy to make a distinction in favour of a\n    gentleman so distinguished for success in the fine arts as Mr. ----\n    ----, residing at Cleikum. If Mr. ---- ---- should be inclined, upon\n    becoming further acquainted with the COMPANY and RULES of the\n    Place, to remove his residence to the Well, Mr. Winterblossom,\n    though he would not be understood to commit himself by a positive\n    assurance to that effect, is inclined to hope that an arrangement\n    might be made, notwithstanding the extreme crowd of the season, to\n    accommodate Mr. ---- ---- at the lodging-house, called\n    Lilliput-Hall. It will much conduce to facilitate this negotiation,\n    if Mr. ---- ---- would have the goodness to send an exact note of\n    his stature, as Captain Rannletree seems disposed to resign the\n    folding-bed at Lilliput-Hall, on account of his finding it rather\n    deficient in length. Mr. Winterblossom begs farther to assure Mr.\n    ---- ---- of the esteem in which he holds his genius, and of his\n    high personal consideration.\n\n    \"For ---- ----, Esquire,\n    Cleikum Inn, Old Town of St. Ronan's.\n\n    \"_The Public Rooms,_\n    _Hotel and Tontine, St. Ronan's Well,_\n    _&c. &c. &c._\"\n\nThe above card was written (we love to be precise in matters concerning\northography) in a neat, round, clerk-like hand, which, like Mr.\nWinterblossom's character, in many particulars was most accurate and\ncommonplace, though betraying an affectation both of flourish and of\nfacility.\n\nThe next billet was a contrast to the diplomatic gravity and accuracy of\nMr. Winterblossom's official communication, and ran thus, the young\ndivine's academic jests and classical flowers of eloquence being mingled\nwith some wild flowers from the teeming fancy of Lady Penelope.\n\n    \"A choir of Dryads and Naiads, assembled at the healing spring of\n    St. Ronan's, have learned with surprise that a youth, gifted by\n    Apollo, when the Deity was prodigal, with two of his most esteemed\n    endowments, wanders at will among their domains, frequenting grove\n    and river, without once dreaming of paying homage to its tutelary\n    deities. He is, therefore, summoned to their presence, and prompt\n    obedience will insure him forgiveness; but in case of contumacy, let\n    him beware how he again essays either the lyre or the pallet.\n\n    \"_Postscript._ The adorable Penelope, long enrolled among the\n    Goddesses for her beauty and virtues, gives Nectar and Ambrosia,\n    which mortals call tea and cake, at the Public Rooms, near the\n    Sacred Spring, on Thursday evening, at eight o'clock, when the Muses\n    never fail to attend. The stranger's presence is requested to\n    participate in the delights of the evening.\n\n    \"_Second Postscript._ A shepherd, ambitiously aiming at more\n    accommodation than his narrow cot affords, leaves it in a day or\n    two.\n\n        'Assuredly the thing is to be hired.'\n\n            _As You Like It._\n\n    \"_Postscript third._ Our Iris, whom mortals know as Trotting Nelly\n    in her tartan cloak, will bring us the stranger's answer to our\n    celestial summons.\"\n\nThis letter was written in a delicate Italian hand, garnished with fine\nhair-strokes and dashes, which were sometimes so dexterously thrown off\nas to represent lyres, pallets, vases, and other appropriate\ndecorations, suited to the tenor of the contents.\n\nThe third epistle was a complete contrast to the other two. It was\nwritten in a coarse, irregular, schoolboy half-text, which, however,\nseemed to have cost the writer as much pains as if it had been a\nspecimen of the most exquisite caligraphy. And these were the\ncontents:--\n\n    \"SUR--Jack Moobray has betted with me that the samon you killed on\n    Saturday last weyd ni to eiteen pounds,--I say nyer sixteen.--So you\n    being a spurtsman, 'tis refer'd.--So hope you will come or send\n    me't; do not doubt you will be on honour. The bet is a dozen of\n    claret, to be drank at the hotel by our own sett, on Monday next;\n    and we beg you will make one; and Moobray hopes you will come\n    down.--Being, sir, your most humbel servant,--Bingo Binks Baronet,\n    and of Block-hall.\n\n    \"_Postscript._ Have sent some loops of Indian gout, also some black\n    hakkels of my groom's dressing; hope they will prove killing, as\n    suiting river and season.\"\n\nNo answer was received to any of these invitations for more than three\ndays; which, while it secretly rather added to than diminished the\ncuriosity of the Wellers concerning the Unknown, occasioned much railing\nin public against him, as ill-mannered and rude.\n\nMeantime, Francis Tyrrel, to his great surprise, began to find, like the\nphilosophers, that he was never less alone than when alone. In the most\nsilent and sequestered walks, to which the present state of his mind\ninduced him to betake himself, he was sure to find some strollers from\nthe Well, to whom he had become the object of so much solicitous\ninterest. Quite innocent of the knowledge that he himself possessed the\nattraction which occasioned his meeting them so frequently, he began to\ndoubt whether the Lady Penelope and her maidens--Mr. Winterblossom and\nhis grey pony--the parson and his short black coat and raven-grey\npantaloons--were not either actually polygraphic copies of the same\nindividuals, or possessed of a celerity of motion resembling\nomnipresence and ubiquity; for nowhere could he go without meeting\nthem, and that oftener than once a-day, in the course of his walks.\nSometimes the presence of the sweet Lycoris was intimated by the sweet\nprattle in an adjacent shade; sometimes, when Tyrrel thought himself\nmost solitary, the parson's flute was heard snoring forth Gramachree\nMolly; and if he betook himself to the river, he was pretty sure to find\nhis sport watched by Sir Bingo or some of his friends.\n\nThe efforts which Tyrrel made to escape from this persecution, and the\nimpatience of it which his manner indicated, procured him, among the\nWellers, the name of the _Misanthrope_; and, once distinguished as an\nobject of curiosity, he was the person most attended to, who could at\nthe ordinary of the day give the most accurate account of where the\nMisanthrope had been, and how occupied in the course of the morning. And\nso far was Tyrrel's shyness from diminishing the desire of the Wellers\nfor his society, that the latter feeling increased with the difficulty\nof gratification,--as the angler feels the most peculiar interest when\nthrowing his fly for the most cunning and considerate trout in the pool.\n\nIn short, such was the interest which the excited imaginations of the\ncompany took in the Misanthrope, that, notwithstanding the unamiable\nqualities which the word expresses, there was only one of the society\nwho did not desire to see the specimen at their rooms, for the purpose\nof examining him closely and at leisure; and the ladies were\nparticularly desirous to enquire whether he was actually a Misanthrope?\nWhether he had been always a Misanthrope? What had induced him to become\na Misanthrope? And whether there were no means of inducing him to cease\nto be a Misanthrope?\n\nOne individual only, as we have said, neither desired to see nor hear\nmore of the supposed Timon of Cleikum, and that was Mr. Mowbray of St.\nRonan's. Through the medium of that venerable character John Pirner,\nprofessed weaver and practical black-fisher in the Aultoun of St.\nRonan's, who usually attended Tyrrel, to show him the casts of the\nriver, carry his bag, and so forth, the Squire had ascertained that the\njudgment of Sir Bingo regarding the disputed weight of the fish was more\ncorrect than his own. This inferred an immediate loss of honour, besides\nthe payment of a heavy bill. And the consequences might be yet more\nserious; nothing short of the emancipation of Sir Bingo, who had\nhitherto been Mowbray's convenient shadow and adherent, but who, if\ntriumphant, confiding in his superiority of judgment upon so important a\npoint, might either cut him altogether, or expect that, in future, the\nSquire, who had long seemed the planet of their set, should be content\nto roll around himself, Sir Bingo, in the capacity of a satellite.\n\nThe Squire, therefore, devoutly hoped that Tyrrel's restive disposition\nmight continue, to prevent the decision of the bet, while, at the same\ntime, he nourished a very reasonable degree of dislike to that stranger,\nwho had been the indirect occasion of the unpleasant predicament in\nwhich he found himself, by not catching a salmon weighing a pound\nheavier. He, therefore, openly censured the meanness of those who\nproposed taking further notice of Tyrrel, and referred to the unanswered\nletters, as a piece of impertinence which announced him to be no\ngentleman.\n\nBut though appearances were against him, and though he was in truth\nnaturally inclined to solitude, and averse to the affectation and\nbustle of such a society, that part of Tyrrel's behaviour which\nindicated ill-breeding was easily accounted for, by his never having\nreceived the letters which required an answer. Trotting Nelly, whether\nunwilling to face her gossip, Meg Dods, without bringing back the\ndrawing, or whether oblivious through the influence of the double dram\nwith which she had been indulged at the Well, jumbled off with her cart\nto her beloved village of Scate-raw, from which she transmitted the\nletters by the first bare-legged gillie who travelled towards Aultoun of\nSt. Ronan's; so that at last, but after a long delay, they reached the\nCleikum Inn and the hands of Mr. Tyrrel.\n\nThe arrival of these documents explained some part of the oddity of\nbehaviour which had surprised him in his neighbours of the Well; and as\nhe saw they had got somehow an idea of his being a lion extraordinary,\nand was sensible that such is a character equally ridiculous, and\ndifficult to support, he hastened to write to Mr. Winterblossom a card\nin the style of ordinary mortals. In this he stated the delay occasioned\nby miscarriage of the letter, and his regret on that account; expressed\nhis intention of dining with the company at the Well on the succeeding\nday, while he regretted that other circumstances, as well as the state\nof his health and spirits, would permit him this honour very\ninfrequently during his stay in the country, and begged no trouble might\nbe taken about his accommodation at the Well, as he was perfectly\nsatisfied with his present residence. A separate note to Sir Bingo, said\nhe was happy he could verify the weight of the fish, which he had noted\nin his diary; (\"D--n the fellow, does he keep a diary?\" said the\nBaronet,) and though the result could only be particularly agreeable to\none party, he should wish both winner and loser mirth with their\nwine;--he was sorry he was unable to promise himself the pleasure of\nparticipating in either. Enclosed was a signed note of the weight of the\nfish. Armed with this, Sir Bingo claimed his wine--triumphed in his\njudgment--swore louder and more articulately than ever he was known to\nutter any previous sounds, that this Tyrrel was a devilish honest\nfellow, and he trusted to be better acquainted with him; while the\ncrestfallen Squire, privately cursing the stranger by all his gods, had\nno mode of silencing his companion but by allowing his loss, and fixing\na day for discussing the bet.\n\nIn the public rooms the company examined even microscopically the\nresponse of the stranger to Mr. Winterblossom, straining their ingenuity\nto discover, in the most ordinary expressions, a deeper and esoteric\nmeaning, expressive of something mysterious, and not meant to meet the\neye. Mr. Meiklewham, the writer, dwelt on the word _circumstances_,\nwhich he read with peculiar emphasis.\n\n\"Ah, poor lad!\" he concluded, \"I doubt he sits cheaper at Meg Dorts's\nchimney-corner than he could do with the present company.\"\n\nDoctor Quackleben, in the manner of a clergyman selecting a word from\nhis text, as that which is to be particularly insisted upon, repeated in\nan under tone, the words, \"_State of health?_--umph--state of\nhealth?--Nothing acute--no one has been sent for--must be\nchronic--tending to gout, perhaps.--Or his shyness to society--light\nwild eye--irregular step--starting when met suddenly by a stranger, and\nturning abruptly and angrily away--Pray, Mr. Winterblossom, let me have\nan order to look over the file of newspapers--it's very troublesome that\nrestriction about consulting them.\"\n\n\"You know it is a necessary one, Doctor,\" said the president; \"because\nso few of the good company read any thing else, that the old newspapers\nwould have been worn to pieces long since.\"\n\n\"Well, well, let me have the order,\" said the Doctor; \"I remember\nsomething of a gentleman run away from his friends--I must look at the\ndescription.--I believe I have a strait-jacket somewhere about the\nDispensary.\"\n\nWhile this suggestion appalled the male part of the company, who did not\nmuch relish the approaching dinner in company with a gentleman whose\nsituation seemed so precarious, some of the younger Misses whispered to\neach other--\"Ah, poor fellow!--and if it be as the Doctor supposes, my\nlady, who knows what the cause of his illness may have been?--His\n_spirits_ he complains of--ah, poor man!\"\n\nAnd thus, by the ingenious commentaries of the company at the Well, on\nas plain a note as ever covered the eighth part of a sheet of foolscap,\nthe writer was deprived of his property, his reason, and his heart, \"all\nor either, or one or other of them,\" as is briefly and distinctly\nexpressed in the law phrase.\n\nIn short, so much was said _pro_ and _con_, so many ideas started and\ntheories maintained, concerning the disposition and character of the\nMisanthrope, that, when the company assembled at the usual time, before\nproceeding to dinner, they doubted, as it seemed, whether the expected\naddition to their society was to enter the room on his hands or his\nfeet; and when \"Mr. Tyrrel\" was announced by Toby, at the top of his\nvoice, the gentleman who entered the room had so very little to\ndistinguish him from others, that there was a momentary disappointment.\nThe ladies, in particular, began to doubt whether the compound of\ntalent, misanthropy, madness, and mental sensibility, which they had\npictured to themselves, actually was the same with the genteel, and even\nfashionable-looking man whom they saw before them; who, though in a\nmorning-dress, which the distance of his residence, and the freedom of\nthe place, made excusable, had, even in the minute points of his\nexterior, none of the negligence, or wildness, which might be supposed\nto attach to the vestments of a misanthropic recluse, whether sane or\ninsane. As he paid his compliments round the circle, the scales seemed\nto fall from the eyes of those he spoke to; and they saw with surprise,\nthat the exaggerations had existed entirely in their own preconceptions,\nand that whatever the fortunes, or rank in life, of Mr. Tyrrel might be,\nhis manners, without being showy, were gentlemanlike and pleasing. He\nreturned his thanks to Mr. Winterblossom in a manner which made that\ngentleman recall his best breeding to answer the stranger's address in\nkind. He then escaped from the awkwardness of remaining the sole object\nof attention, by gliding gradually among the company,--not like an owl,\nwhich seeks to hide itself in a thicket, or an awkward and retired man,\nshrinking from the society into which he is compelled, but with the air\nof one who could maintain with ease his part in a higher circle. His\naddress to Lady Penelope was adapted to the romantic tone of Mr.\nChatterly's epistle, to which it was necessary to allude. He was afraid,\nhe said, he must complain to Juno of the neglect of Iris, for her\nirregularity in delivery of a certain ethereal command, which he had not\ndared to answer otherwise than by mute obedience--unless, indeed, as the\nimport of the letter seemed to infer, the invitation was designed for\nsome more gifted individual than he to whom chance had assigned it.\n\nLady Penelope by her lips, and many of the young ladies with their eyes,\nassured him there was no mistake in the matter; that he was really the\ngifted person whom the nymphs had summoned to their presence, and that\nthey were well acquainted with his talents as a poet and a painter.\nTyrrel disclaimed, with earnestness and gravity, the charge of poetry,\nand professed, that, far from attempting the art itself, he \"read with\nreluctance all but the productions of the very first-rate poets, and\nsome of these--he was almost afraid to say--he should have liked better\nin humble prose.\"\n\n\"You have now only to disown your skill as an artist,\" said Lady\nPenelope, \"and we must consider Mr. Tyrrel as the falsest and most\ndeceitful of his sex, who has a mind to deprive us of the opportunity of\nbenefiting by the productions of his unparalleled endowments. I assure\nyou I shall put my young friends on their guard. Such dissimulation\ncannot be without its object.\"\n\n\"And I,\" said Mr. Winterblossom, \"can produce a piece of real evidence\nagainst the culprit.\"\n\nSo saying, he unrolled the sketch which he had filched from Trotting\nNelly, and which he had pared and pasted, (arts in which he was\neminent,) so as to take out its creases, repair its breaches, and vamp\nit as well as my old friend Mrs. Weir could have repaired the damages of\ntime on a folio Shakspeare.\n\n\"The vara _corpus delicti_,\" said the writer, grinning and rubbing his\nhands.\n\n\"If you are so good as to call such scratches drawings,\" said Tyrrel, \"I\nmust stand so far confessed. I used to do them for my own amusement; but\nsince my landlady, Mrs. Dods, has of late discovered that I gain my\nlivelihood by them, why should I disown it?\"\n\nThis avowal, made without the least appearance either of shame or\n_retenue_, seemed to have a striking effect on the whole society. The\npresident's trembling hand stole the sketch back to the portfolio,\nafraid doubtless it might be claimed in form, or else compensation\nexpected by the artist. Lady Penelope was disconcerted, like an awkward\nhorse when it changes the leading foot in galloping. She had to recede\nfrom the respectful and easy footing on which he had contrived to place\nhimself, to one which might express patronage on her own part, and\ndependence on Tyrrel's; and this could not be done in a moment.\n\nThe Man of Law murmured, \"Circumstances--circumstances--I thought so!\"\n\nSir Bingo whispered to his friend the Squire, \"Run out--blown up--off\nthe course--pity--d----d pretty fellow he has been!\"\n\n\"A raff from the beginning!\" whispered Mowbray.--\"I never thought him\nany thing else.\"\n\n\"I'll hold ye a poney of that, my dear, and I'll ask him.\"\n\n\"Done, for a poney, provided you ask him in ten minutes,\" said the\nSquire; \"but you dare not, Bingie--he has a d----d cross game look,\nwith all that civil chaff of his.\"\n\n\"Done,\" said Sir Bingo, but in a less confident tone than before, and\nwith a determination to proceed with some caution in the matter.--\"I\nhave got a rouleau above, and Winterblossom shall hold stakes.\"\n\n\"I have no rouleau,\" said the Squire; \"but I'll fly a cheque on\nMeiklewham.\"\n\n\"See it be better than your last,\" said Sir Bingo, \"for I won't be\nskylarked again. Jack, my boy, you are had.\"\n\n\"Not till the bet's won; and I shall see yon walking dandy break your\nhead, Bingie, before that,\" answered Mowbray. \"Best speak to the Captain\nbefore hand--it is a hellish scrape you are running into--I'll let you\noff yet, Bingie, for a guinea forfeit.--See, I am just going to start\nthe tattler.\"\n\n\"Start, and be d----d!\" said Sir Bingo. \"You are gotten, I assure you o'\nthat, Jack.\" And with a bow and a shuffle, he went up and introduced\nhimself to the stranger as Sir Bingo Binks.\n\n\"Had--honour--write--sir,\" were the only sounds which his throat, or\nrather his cravat, seemed to send forth.\n\n\"Confound the booby!\" thought Mowbray; \"he will get out of leading\nstrings, if he goes on at this rate; and doubly confounded be this\ncursed tramper, who, the Lord knows why, has come hither from the Lord\nknows where, to drive the pigs through my game.\"\n\nIn the meantime, while his friend stood with his stop-watch in his hand,\nwith a visage lengthened under the influence of these reflections, Sir\nBingo, with an instinctive tact, which self-preservation seemed to\ndictate to a brain neither the most delicate nor subtle in the world,\npremised his enquiry by some general remark on fishing and field-sports.\nWith all these, he found Tyrrel more than passably acquainted. Of\nfishing and shooting, particularly, he spoke with something like\nenthusiasm; so that Sir Bingo began to hold him in considerable respect,\nand to assure himself that he could not be, or at least could not\noriginally have been bred, the itinerant artist which he now gave\nhimself out--and this, with the fast lapse of the time, induced him thus\nto address Tyrrel.--\"I say, Mr. Tyrrel--why, you have been one of us--I\nsay\"----\n\n\"If you mean a sportsman, Sir Bingo--I have been, and am a pretty keen\none still,\" replied Tyrrel.\n\n\"Why, then, you did not always do them sort of things?\"\n\n\"What sort of things do you mean, Sir Bingo?\" said Tyrrel. \"I have not\nthe pleasure of understanding you.\"\n\n\"Why, I mean them sketches,\" said Sir Bingo. \"I'll give you a handsome\norder for them, if you will tell me. I will, on my honour.\"\n\n\"Does it concern you particularly, Sir Bingo, to know any thing of my\naffairs?\" said Tyrrel.\n\n\"No--certainly--not immediately,\" answered Sir Bingo, with some\nhesitation, for he liked not the dry tone in which Tyrrel's answers were\nreturned, half so well as a bumper of dry sherry; \"only I said you were\na d----d gnostic fellow, and I laid a bet you have not been always\nprofessional--that's all.\"\n\nMr. Tyrrel replied, \"A bet with Mr. Mowbray, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes, with Jack,\" replied the Baronet--\"you have hit it--I hope I have\ndone him?\"\n\nTyrrel bent his brows, and looked first at Mr. Mowbray, then at the\nBaronet, and, after a moment's thought, addressed the latter.--\"Sir\nBingo Binks, you are a gentleman of elegant enquiry and acute\njudgment.--You are perfectly right--I was _not_ bred to the profession\nof an artist, nor did I practise it formerly, whatever I may do now; and\nso that question is answered.\"\n\n\"And Jack is diddled,\" said the Baronet, smiting his thigh in triumph,\nand turning towards the Squire and the stake-holder, with a smile of\nexultation.\n\n\"Stop a single moment, Sir Bingo,\" said Tyrrel; \"take one word with you.\nI have a great respect for bets,--it is part of an Englishman's\ncharacter to bet on what he thinks fit, and to prosecute his enquiries\nover hedge and ditch, as if he were steeple-hunting. But as I have\nsatisfied you on the subject of two bets, that is sufficient compliance\nwith the custom of the country; and therefore I request, Sir Bingo, you\nwill not make me or my affairs the subject of any more wagers.\"\n\n\"I'll be d----d if I do,\" was the internal resolution of Sir Bingo.\nAloud he muttered some apologies, and was heartily glad that the\ndinner-bell, sounding at the moment, afforded him an apology for\nshuffling off in a different direction.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nTABLE-TALK.\n\n    And, sir, if these accounts be true,\n    The Dutch have mighty things in view;\n    The Austrians--I admire French beans,\n    Dear ma'am, above all other greens.\n\n       *       *       *       *       *\n\n    And all as lively and as brisk\n    As--Ma'am, d'ye choose a game at whisk?\n\n_Table-Talk._\n\n\nWhen they were about to leave the room, Lady Penelope assumed Tyrrel's\narm with a sweet smile of condescension, meant to make the honoured\nparty understand in its full extent the favour conferred. But the\nunreasonable artist, far from intimating the least confusion at an\nattention so little to be expected, seemed to consider the distinction\nas one which was naturally paid to the greatest stranger present; and\nwhen he placed Lady Penelope at the head of the table, by Mr.\nWinterblossom the president, and took a chair for himself betwixt her\nladyship and Lady Binks, the provoking wretch appeared no more sensible\nof being exalted above his proper rank in society, than if he had been\nsitting at the bottom of the table by honest Mrs. Blower from the\nBow-head, who had come to the Well to carry off the dregs of the\n_Inflienzie_, which she scorned to term a surfeit.\n\nNow this indifference puzzled Lady Penelope's game extremely, and\nirritated her desire to get at the bottom of Tyrrel's mystery, if there\nwas one, and secure him to her own party. If you were ever at a\nwatering-place, reader, you know that while the guests do not always pay\nthe most polite attention to unmarked individuals, the appearance of a\nstray lion makes an interest as strong as it is reasonable, and the\nAmazonian chiefs of each coterie, like the hunters of Buenos-Ayres,\nprepare their _lasso_, and manoeuvre to the best advantage they can,\neach hoping to noose the unsuspicious monster, and lead him captive to\nher own menagerie. A few words concerning Lady Penelope Penfeather will\nexplain why she practised this sport with even more than common zeal.\n\nShe was the daughter of an earl, possessed a showy person, and features\nwhich might be called handsome in youth, though now rather too much\n_prononc\u00c3\u00a9s_ to render the term proper. The nose was become sharper; the\ncheeks had lost the roundness of youth; and as, during fifteen years\nthat she had reigned a beauty and a ruling toast, the right man had not\nspoken, or, at least, had not spoken at the right time, her ladyship,\nnow rendered sufficiently independent by the inheritance of an old\nrelation, spoke in praise of friendship, began to dislike the town in\nsummer, and to \"babble of green fields.\"\n\nAbout the time Lady Penelope thus changed the tenor of her life, she was\nfortunate enough, with Dr. Quackleben's assistance, to find out the\nvirtues of St Ronan's spring; and having contributed her share to\nestablish the _urbs in rure_, which had risen around it, she sat herself\ndown as leader of the fashions in the little province which she had in a\ngreat measure both discovered and colonized. She was, therefore, justly\ndesirous to compel homage and tribute from all who should approach the\nterritory.\n\nIn other respects, Lady Penelope pretty much resembled the numerous\nclass she belonged to. She was at bottom a well-principled woman, but\ntoo thoughtless to let her principles control her humour, therefore not\nscrupulously nice in her society. She was good-natured, but capricious\nand whimsical, and willing enough to be kind or generous, if it neither\nthwarted her humour, nor cost her much trouble; would have chaperoned a\nyoung friend any where, and moved the world for subscription tickets;\nbut never troubled herself how much her giddy charge flirted, or with\nwhom; so that, with a numerous class of Misses, her ladyship was the\nmost delightful creature in the world. Then Lady Penelope had lived so\nmuch in society, knew so exactly when to speak, and how to escape from\nan embarrassing discussion by professing ignorance, while she looked\nintelligence, that she was not generally discovered to be a fool, unless\nwhen she set up for being remarkably clever. This happened more\nfrequently of late, when, perhaps, as she could not but observe that the\nrepairs of the toilet became more necessary, she might suppose that new\nlights, according to the poet, were streaming on her mind through the\nchinks that Time was making. Many of her friends, however, thought that\nLady Penelope would have better consulted her genius by remaining in\nmediocrity, as a fashionable and well-bred woman, than by parading her\nnew-founded pretensions to taste and patronage; but such was not her own\nopinion, and doubtless, her ladyship was the best judge.\n\nOn the other side of Tyrrel sat Lady Binks, lately the beautiful Miss\nBonnyrigg, who, during the last season, had made the company at the Well\nalternately admire, smile, and stare, by dancing the highest Highland\nfling, riding the wildest pony, laughing the loudest laugh at the\nbroadest joke, and wearing the briefest petticoat of any nymph of St.\nRonan's. Few knew that this wild, hoydenish, half-mad humour, was only\nsuperinduced over her real character, for the purpose of--getting well\nmarried. She had fixed her eyes on Sir Bingo, and was aware of his\nmaxim, that to catch him, \"a girl must be,\" in his own phrase, \"bang up\nto every thing;\" and that he would choose a wife for the neck-or-nothing\nqualities which recommend a good hunter. She made out her catch-match,\nand she was miserable. Her wild good-humour was entirely an assumed part\nof her character, which was passionate, ambitious, and thoughtful.\nDelicacy she had none--she knew Sir Bingo was a brute and a fool, even\nwhile she was hunting him down; but she had so far mistaken her own\nfeelings, as not to have expected that when she became bone of his bone,\nshe should feel so much shame and anger when she saw his folly expose\nhim to be laughed at and plundered, or so disgusted when his brutality\nbecame intimately connected with herself. It is true, he was on the\nwhole rather an innocent monster; and between bitting and bridling,\ncoaxing and humouring, might have been made to pad on well enough. But\nan unhappy boggling which had taken place previous to the declaration of\ntheir private marriage, had so exasperated her spirits against her\nhelpmate, that modes of conciliation were the last she was likely to\nadopt. Not only had the assistance of the Scottish Themis, so\npropitiously indulgent to the foibles of the fair, been resorted to on\nthe occasion, but even Mars seemed ready to enter upon the tapis, if\nHymen had not intervened. There was, _de par le monde_, a certain\nbrother of the lady--an officer--and, as it happened, on leave of\nabsence,--who alighted from a hack-chaise at the Fox Hotel, at eleven\no'clock at night, holding in his hand a slip of well-dried oak,\naccompanied by another gentleman, who, like himself, wore a military\ntravelling-cap and a black stock; out of the said chaise, as was\nreported by the trusty Toby, was handed a small reise-sac, an Andrew\nFerrara, and a neat mahogany box, eighteen inches long, three deep, and\nsome six broad. Next morning a solemn _palaver_ (as the natives of\nMadagascar call their national convention) was held at an unusual hour,\nat which Captain MacTurk and Mr. Mowbray assisted; and the upshot was,\nthat at breakfast the company were made happy by the information, that\nSir Bingo had been for some weeks the happy bridegroom of their general\nfavourite; which union, concealed for family reasons, he was now at\nliberty to acknowledge, and to fly with the wings of love to bring his\nsorrowing turtle from the shades to which she had retired, till the\nobstacles to their mutual happiness could be removed. Now, though all\nthis sounded very smoothly, that gall-less turtle, Lady Binks, could\nnever think of the tenor of the proceedings without the deepest feelings\nof resentment and contempt for the principal actor, Sir Bingo.\n\nBesides all these unpleasant circumstances, Sir Bingo's family had\nrefused to countenance her wish that he should bring her to his own\nseat; and hence a new shock to her pride, and new matter of contempt\nagainst poor Sir Bingo, for being ashamed and afraid to face down the\nopposition of his kins-folk, for whose displeasure, though never\nattending to any good advice from them, he retained a childish awe.\n\nThe manners of the young lady were no less changed than was her temper;\nand, from being much too careless and free, were become reserved,\nsullen, and haughty. A consciousness that many scrupled to hold\nintercourse with her in society, rendered her disagreeably tenacious of\nher rank, and jealous of every thing that appeared like neglect. She had\nconstituted herself mistress of Sir Bingo's purse; and, unrestrained in\nthe expenses of dress and equipage, chose, contrary to her maiden\npractice, to be rather rich and splendid than gay, and to command that\nattention by magnificence, which she no longer deigned to solicit by\nrendering herself either agreeable or entertaining. One secret source of\nher misery was, the necessity of showing deference to Lady Penelope\nPenfeather, whose understanding she despised, and whose pretensions to\nconsequence, to patronage, and to literature, she had acuteness enough\nto see through, and to contemn; and this dislike was the more grievous,\nthat she felt she depended a good deal on Lady Penelope's countenance\nfor the situation she was able to maintain even among the not very\nselect society of St. Ronan's Well; and that, neglected by her, she must\nhave dropped lower in the scale even there. Neither was Lady Penelope's\nkindness to Lady Binks extremely cordial. She partook in the ancient and\nordinary dislike of single nymphs of a certain age, to those who made\nsplendid alliances under their very eye--and she more than suspected the\nsecret disaffection of the lady. But the name sounded well; and the\nstyle in which Lady Binks lived was a credit to the place. So they\nsatisfied their mutual dislike with saying a few sharp things to each\nother occasionally, but all under the mask of civility.\n\nSuch was Lady Binks; and yet, being such, her dress, and her equipage,\nand carriages, were the envy of half the Misses at the Well, who, while\nshe sat disfiguring with sullenness her very lovely face, (for it was as\nbeautiful as her shape was exquisite,) only thought she was proud of\nhaving carried her point, and felt herself, with her large fortune and\ndiamond bandeau, no fit company for the rest of the party. They gave\nway, therefore, with meekness to her domineering temper, though it was\nnot the less tyrannical, that in her maiden state of hoyden-hood, she\nhad been to some of them an object of slight and of censure; and Lady\nBinks had not forgotten the offences offered to Miss Bonnyrigg. But the\nfair sisterhood submitted to her retaliations, as lieutenants endure the\nbullying of a rude and boisterous captain of the sea, with the secret\ndetermination to pay it home to their underlings, when they shall become\ncaptains themselves.\n\nIn this state of importance, yet of penance, Lady Binks occupied her\nplace at the dinner-table, alternately disconcerted by some stupid\nspeech of her lord and master, and by some slight sarcasm from Lady\nPenelope, to which she longed to reply, but dared not.\n\nShe looked from time to time at her neighbour Frank Tyrrel, but without\naddressing him, and accepted in silence the usual civilities which he\nproffered to her. She had remarked keenly his interview with Sir Bingo,\nand knowing by experience the manner in which her honoured lord was wont\nto retreat from a dispute in which he was unsuccessful, as well as his\ngenius for getting into such perplexities, she had little doubt that he\nhad sustained from the stranger some new indignity; whom, therefore, she\nregarded with a mixture of feeling, scarce knowing whether to be pleased\nwith him for having given pain to him whom she hated, or angry with him\nfor having affronted one in whose degradation her own was necessarily\ninvolved. There might be other thoughts--on the whole, she regarded him\nwith much though with mute attention. He paid her but little in return,\nbeing almost entirely occupied in replying to the questions of the\nengrossing Lady Penelope Penfeather.\n\nReceiving polite though rather evasive answers to her enquiries\nconcerning his late avocations, her ladyship could only learn that\nTyrrel had been travelling in several remote parts of Europe, and even\nof Asia. Baffled, but not repulsed, the lady continued her courtesy, by\npointing out to him, as a stranger, several individuals of the company\nto whom she proposed introducing him, as persons from whose society he\nmight derive either profit or amusement. In the midst of this sort of\nconversation, however, she suddenly stopped short.\n\n\"Will you forgive me, Mr. Tyrrel,\" she said, \"if I say I have been\nwatching your thoughts for some moments, and that I have detected you?\nAll the while that I have been talking of these good folks, and that you\nhave been making such civil replies, that they might be with great\npropriety and utility inserted in the 'Familiar Dialogues, teaching\nforeigners how to express themselves in English upon ordinary\noccasions'--your mind has been entirely fixed upon that empty chair,\nwhich hath remained there opposite betwixt our worthy president and Sir\nBingo Binks.\"\n\n\"I own, madam,\" he answered, \"I was a little surprised at seeing such a\ndistinguished seat unoccupied, while the table is rather crowded.\"\n\n\"O, confess more, sir!--Confess that to a poet a seat unoccupied--the\nchair of Banquo--has more charms than if it were filled even as an\nalderman would fill it.--What if 'the Dark Ladye'[I-14] should glide in\nand occupy it?--would you have courage to stand the vision, Mr.\nTyrrel?--I assure you the thing is not impossible.\"\n\n\"_What_ is not impossible, Lady Penelope?\" said Tyrrel, somewhat\nsurprised.\n\n\"Startled already?--Nay, then, I despair of your enduring the awful\ninterview.\"\n\n\"What interview? who is expected?\" said Tyrrel, unable with the utmost\nexertion to suppress some signs of curiosity, though he suspected the\nwhole to be merely some mystification of her ladyship.\n\n\"How delighted I am,\" she said, \"that I have found out where you are\nvulnerable!--Expected--did I say expected?--no, not expected.\n\n    'She glides, like Night, from land to land,\n    She hath strange power of speech.'\n\n--But come, I have you at my mercy, and I will be generous and\nexplain.--We call--that is, among ourselves, you understand--Miss Clara\nMowbray, the sister of that gentleman that sits next to Miss Parker, the\nDark Ladye, and that seat is left for her.--For she was expected--no,\nnot expected--I forget again!--but it was thought _possible_ she might\nhonour us to-day, when our feast was so full and piquant.--Her brother\nis our Lord of the Manor--and so they pay her that sort of civility to\nregard her as a visitor--and neither Lady Binks nor I think of\nobjecting--She is a singular young person, Clara Mowbray--she amuses me\nvery much--I am always rather glad to see her.\"\n\n\"She is not to come hither to-day,\" said Tyrrel; \"am I so to understand\nyour ladyship?\"\n\n\"Why, it is past her time--even _her_ time,\" said Lady Penelope--\"dinner\nwas kept back half an hour, and our poor invalids were famishing, as you\nmay see by the deeds they have done since.--But Clara is an odd\ncreature, and if she took it into her head to come hither at this\nmoment, hither she would come--she is very whimsical.--Many people think\nher handsome--but she looks so like something from another world, that\nshe makes me always think of Mat Lewis's Spectre Lady.\"\n\nAnd she repeated with much cadence,\n\n    \"There is a thing--there is a thing,\n      I fain would have from thee;\n    I fain would have that gay gold ring,\n      O warrior, give it me!\"\n\n\"And then you remember his answer:\n\n    'This ring Lord Brooke from his daughter took,\n      And a solemn oath he swore,\n    That that ladye my bride should be\n      When this crusade was o'er.'\n\nYou do figures as well as landscapes, I suppose, Mr. Tyrrel?--You shall\nmake a sketch for me--a slight thing--for sketches, I think, show the\nfreedom of art better than finished pieces--I dote on the first\ncoruscations of genius--flashing like lightning from the cloud!--You\nshall make a sketch for my boudoir--my dear sulky den at Air Castle, and\nClara Mowbray shall sit for the Ghost Ladye.\"\n\n\"That would be but a poor compliment to your ladyship's friend,\" replied\nTyrrel.\n\n\"Friend? We don't get quite that length, though I like Clara very\nwell.--Quite sentimental cast of face--I think I saw an antique in the\nLouvre very like her--(I was there in 1800)--quite an antique\ncountenance--eyes something hollowed--care has dug caves for them, but\nthey are caves of the most beautiful marble, arched with jet--a straight\nnose, and absolutely the Grecian mouth and chin--a profusion of long\nstraight black hair, with the whitest skin you ever saw--as white as the\nwhitest parchment--and not a shade of colour in her cheek--none\nwhatever--If she would be naughty, and borrow a prudent touch of\ncomplexion, she might be called beautiful. Even as it is, many think her\nso, although surely, Mr. Tyrrel, three colours are necessary to the\nfemale face. However, we used to call her the Melpomene of the Spring\nlast season, as we called Lady Binks--who was not then Lady Binks--our\nEuphrosyne--did we not, my dear?\"\n\n\"Did we not what, madam?\" said Lady Binks, in a tone something sharper\nthan ought to have belonged to so beautiful a countenance.\n\n\"I am sorry I have started you out of your reverie, my love,\" answered\nLady Penelope. \"I was only assuring Mr. Tyrrel that you were once\nEuphrosyne, though now so much under the banners of Il Penseroso.\"\n\n\"I do not know that I have been either one or the other,\" answered Lady\nBinks; \"one thing I certainly am not--I am not capable of understanding\nyour ladyship's wit and learning.\"\n\n\"Poor soul,\" whispered Lady Penelope to Tyrrel; \"we know what we are, we\nknow not what we may be.--And now, Mr. Tyrrel, I have been your sibyl to\nguide you through this Elysium of ours, I think, in reward, I deserve a\nlittle confidence in return.\"\n\n\"If I had any to bestow, which could be in the slightest degree\ninteresting to your ladyship,\" answered Tyrrel.\n\n\"Oh! cruel man--he will not understand me!\" exclaimed the lady--\"In\nplain words, then, a peep into your portfolio--just to see what objects\nyou have rescued from natural decay, and rendered immortal by the\npencil. You do not know--indeed, Mr. Tyrrel, you do not know how I dote\nupon your 'serenely silent art,' second to poetry alone--equal--superior\nperhaps--to music.\"\n\n\"I really have little that could possibly be worth the attention of such\na judge as your ladyship,\" answered Tyrrel; \"such trifles as your\nladyship has seen, I sometimes leave at the foot of the tree I have been\nsketching.\"\n\n\"As Orlando left his verses in the Forest of Ardennes?--Oh, the\nthoughtless prodigality!--Mr. Winterblossom, do you hear this?--We must\nfollow Mr. Tyrrel in his walks, and glean what he leaves behind him.\"\n\nHer ladyship was here disconcerted by some laughter on Sir Bingo's side\nof the table, which she chastised by an angry glance, and then proceeded\nemphatically.\n\n\"Mr. Tyrrel--this must _not_ be--this is not the way of the world, my\ngood sir, to which even genius must stoop its flight. We must consult\nthe engraver--though perhaps you etch as well as you draw?\"\n\n\"I should suppose so,\" said Mr. Winterblossom, edging in a word with\ndifficulty, \"from the freedom of Mr. Tyrrel's touch.\"\n\n\"I will not deny my having spoiled a little copper now and then,\" said\nTyrrel, \"since I am charged with the crime by such good judges; but it\nhas only been by way of experiment.\"\n\n\"Say no more,\" said the lady; \"my darling wish is accomplished!--We have\nlong desired to have the remarkable and most romantic spots of our\nlittle Arcadia here--spots consecrated to friendship, the fine arts, the\nloves and the graces, immortalized by the graver's art, faithful to its\ncharge of fame--you shall labour on this task, Mr. Tyrrel; we will all\nassist with notes and illustrations--we will all contribute--only some\nof us must be permitted to remain anonymous--Fairy favours, you know,\nMr. Tyrrel, must be kept secret--And you shall be allowed the pillage of\nthe Album--some sweet things there of Mr. Chatterly's--and Mr. Edgeit, a\ngentleman of your own profession, I am sure will lend his aid--Dr.\nQuackleben will contribute some scientific notices.--And for\nsubscription\"----\n\n\"Financial--financial--your leddyship, I speak to order!\" said the\nwriter, interrupting Lady Penelope with a tone of impudent familiarity,\nwhich was meant doubtless for jocular ease.\n\n\"How am I out of order, Mr. Meiklewham?\" said her ladyship, drawing\nherself up.\n\n\"I speak to order!--No warrants for money can be extracted before\nintimation to the Committee of Management.\"\n\n\"Pray, who mentioned money, Mr. Meiklewham?\" said her ladyship.--\"That\nwretched old pettifogger,\" she added in a whisper to Tyrrel, \"thinks of\nnothing else but the filthy pelf.\"\n\n\"Ye spake of subscription, my leddy, whilk is the same thing as money,\ndiffering only in respect of time--the subscription being a contract _de\nfuturo_, and having a _tractus temporis in gremio_--And I have kend mony\nhonest folks in the company at the Well, complain of the subscriptions\nas a great abuse, as obliging them either to look unlike other folk, or\nto gie good lawful coin for ballants and picture-books, and things they\ncaredna a pinch of snuff for.\"\n\nSeveral of the company, at the lower end of the table, assented both by\nnods and murmurs of approbation; and the orator was about to proceed,\nwhen Tyrrel with difficulty procured a hearing before the debate went\nfarther, and assured the company that her ladyship's goodness had led\nher into an error; that he had no work in hand worthy of their\npatronage, and, with the deepest gratitude for Lady Penelope's goodness,\nhad it not in his power to comply with her request. There was some\ntittering at her ladyship's expense, who, as the writer slyly observed,\nhad been something _ultronious_ in her patronage. Without attempting for\nthe moment any rally, (as indeed the time which had passed since the\nremoval of the dinner scarce permitted an opportunity,) Lady Penelope\ngave the signal for the ladies' retreat, and left the gentlemen to the\ncirculation of the bottle.\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[I-14] Note II.--The Dark Ladye.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nTHE TEA-TABLE.\n\n                ----While the cups,\n    Which cheer, but not inebriate, wait on each.\n\nCOWPER.\n\n\nIt was common at the Well, for the fair guests occasionally to give tea\nto the company,--such at least as from their rank and leading in the\nlittle society, might be esteemed fit to constitute themselves\npatronesses of an evening; and the same lady generally carried the\nauthority she had acquired into the ball-room, where two fiddles and a\nbass, at a guinea a night, with a _quantum sufficit_ of tallow candles,\n(against the use of which Lady Penelope often mutinied,) enabled the\ncompany--to use the appropriate phrase--\"to close the evening on the\nlight fantastic toe.\"\n\nOn the present occasion, the lion of the hour, Mr. Francis Tyrrel, had\nso little answered the high-wrought expectations of Lady Penelope, that\nshe rather regretted having ever given herself any trouble about him,\nand particularly that of having manoeuvred herself into the patronage\nof the tea-table for the evening, to the great expenditure of souchong\nand congo. Accordingly, her ladyship had no sooner summoned her own\nwoman, and her _fille de chambre_, to make tea, with her page, footman,\nand postilion, to hand it about, (in which duty they were assisted by\ntwo richly-laced and thickly-powdered footmen of Lady Binks's, whose\nliveries put to shame the more modest garb of Lady Penelope's, and even\ndimmed the glory of the suppressed coronet upon the buttons,) than she\nbegan to vilipend and depreciate what had been so long the object of her\ncuriosity.\n\n\"This Mr. Tyrrel,\" she said, in a tone of authoritative decision, \"seems\nafter all a very ordinary sort of person, quite a commonplace man, who,\nshe dared say, had considered his condition, in going to the old\nalehouse, much better than they had done for him, when they asked him to\nthe Public Rooms. He had known his own place better than they did--there\nwas nothing uncommon in his appearance or conversation--nothing at all\n_frappant_--she scarce believed he could even draw that sketch. Mr.\nWinterblossom, indeed, made a great deal of it; but then all the world\nknew that every scrap of engraving or drawing, which Mr. Winterblossom\ncontrived to make his own, was, the instant it came into his collection,\nthe finest thing that ever was seen--that was the way with\ncollectors--their geese were all swans.\"\n\n\"And your ladyship's swan has proved but a goose, my dearest Lady Pen,\"\nsaid Lady Binks.\n\n\"_My_ swan, dearest Lady Binks! I really do not know how I have deserved\nthe appropriation.\"\n\n\"Do not be angry, my dear Lady Penelope; I only mean, that for a\nfortnight and more you have spoke constantly _of_ this Mr. Tyrrel, and\nall dinner-time you spoke _to_ him.\"\n\nThe fair company began to collect around, at hearing the word _dear_ so\noften repeated in the same brief dialogue, which induced them to expect\nsport, and, like the vulgar on a similar occasion, to form a ring for\nthe expected combatants.\n\n\"He sat betwixt us, Lady Binks,\" answered Lady Penelope, with dignity.\n\"You had your usual headache, you know, and, for the credit of the\ncompany, I spoke for one.\"\n\n\"For _two_, if your ladyship pleases,\" replied Lady Binks. \"I mean,\" she\nadded, softening the expression, \"for yourself and me.\"\n\n\"I am sorry,\" said Lady Penelope, \"I should have spoken for one who can\nspeak so smartly for herself, as my dear Lady Binks--I did not, by any\nmeans, desire to engross the conversation--I repeat it, there is a\nmistake about this man.\"\n\n\"I think there is,\" said Lady Binks, in a tone which implied something\nmore than mere assent to Lady Penelope's proposition.\n\n\"I doubt if he is an artist at all,\" said the Lady Penelope; \"or if he\nis, he must be doing things for some Magazine, or Encyclopedia, or some\nsuch matter.\"\n\n\"_I_ doubt, too, if he be a professional artist,\" said Lady Binks. \"If\nso, he is of the very highest class, for I have seldom seen a\nbetter-bred man.\"\n\n\"There are very well-bred artists,\" said Lady Penelope. \"It is the\nprofession of a gentleman.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" answered Lady Binks; \"but the poorer class have often to\nstruggle with poverty and dependence. In general society, they are like\ncommercial people in presence of their customers; and that is a\ndifficult part to sustain. And so you see them of all sorts--shy and\nreserved, when they are conscious of merit--petulant and whimsical, by\nway of showing their independence--intrusive, in order to appear\neasy--and sometimes obsequious and fawning, when they chance to be of a\nmean spirit. But you seldom see them quite at their ease, and therefore\nI hold this Mr. Tyrrel to be either an artist of the first class, raised\ncompletely above the necessity and degradation of patronage, or else to\nbe no professional artist at all.\"\n\nLady Penelope looked at Lady Binks with much such a regard as Balaam may\nhave cast upon his ass, when he discovered the animal's capacity for\nholding an argument with him. She muttered to herself--\n\n    _\"Mon ane parle, et m\u00c3\u00aame il parle bien!\"_\n\nBut, declining the altercation which Lady Binks seemed disposed to enter\ninto, she replied, with good-humour, \"Well, dearest Rachel, we will not\npull caps about this man--nay, I think your good opinion of him gives\nhim new value in my eyes. That is always the way with us, my good\nfriend! We may confess it, when there are none of these conceited male\nwretches among us. We will know what he really is--he shall not wear\nfern-seed, and walk among us invisible thus--what say you, Maria?\"\n\n\"Indeed, I say, dear Lady Penelope,\" answered Miss Digges, whose ready\nchatter we have already introduced to the reader, \"he is a very handsome\nman, though his nose is too big, and his mouth too wide--but his teeth\nare like pearl--and he has such eyes!--especially when your ladyship\nspoke to him. I don't think you looked at his eyes--they are quite deep\nand dark, and full of glow, like what you read to us in the letter from\nthat lady, about Robert Burns.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, miss, you come on finely!\" said Lady Penelope.--\"One had\nneed take care what they read or talk about before you, I see--Come,\nJones, have mercy upon us--put an end to that symphony of tinkling cups\nand saucers, and let the first act of the tea-table begin, if you\nplease.\"\n\n\"Does her leddyship mean the grace?\" said honest Mrs. Blower, for the\nfirst time admitted into this worshipful society, and busily employed in\narranging an Indian handkerchief, that might have made a mainsail for\none of her husband's smuggling luggers, which she spread carefully on\nher knee, to prevent damage to a flowered black silk gown from the\nrepast of tea and cake, to which she proposed to do due honour--\"Does\nher leddyship mean the grace? I see the minister is just coming in.--Her\nleddyship waits till ye say a blessing, an ye please, sir.\"\n\nMr. Winterblossom, who _toddled_ after the chaplain, his toe having\ngiven him an alert hint to quit the dining-table, though he saw every\nfeature in the poor woman's face swoln with desire to procure\ninformation concerning the ways and customs of the place, passed on the\nother side of the way, regardless of her agony of curiosity.\n\nA moment after, she was relieved by the entrance of Dr. Quackleben,\nwhose maxim being, that one patient was as well worth attention as\nanother, and who knew by experience, that the _honoraria_ of a godly\nwife of the Bow-head were as apt to be forthcoming, (if not more so,) as\nmy Lady Penelope's, he e'en sat himself quietly down by Mrs. Blower, and\nproceeded with the utmost kindness to enquire after her health, and to\nhope she had not forgotten taking a table-spoonful of spirits burnt to a\n_residuum_, in order to qualify the crudities.\n\n\"Indeed, Doctor,\" said the honest woman, \"I loot the brandy burn as lang\nas I dought look at the gude creature wasting itsell that gate--and\nthen, when I was fain to put it out for very thrift, I did take a\nthimbleful of it, (although it is not the thing I am used to, Dr.\nQuackleben,) and I winna say but that it did me good.\"\n\n\"Unquestionably, madam,\" said the Doctor, \"I am no friend to the use of\nalcohol in general, but there are particular cases--there are particular\ncases, Mrs. Blower--My venerated instructor, one of the greatest men in\nour profession that ever lived, took a wine-glassful of old rum, mixed\nwith sugar, every day after his dinner.\"\n\n\"Ay? dear heart, he would be a comfortable doctor that,\" said Mrs.\nBlower. \"He wad maybe ken something of my case. Is he leevin' think ye,\nsir?\"\n\n\"Dead for many years, madam,\" said Dr. Quackleben; \"and there are but\nfew of his pupils that can fill his place, I assure ye. If I could be\nthought an exception, it is only because I was a favourite. Ah!\nblessings on the old red cloak of him!--It covered more of the healing\nscience than the gowns of a whole modern university.\"\n\n\"There is ane, sir,\" said Mrs. Blower, \"that has been muckle recommended\nabout Edinburgh--Macgregor, I think they ca' him--folk come far and near\nto see him.\"[I-15]\n\n\"I know whom you mean, ma'am--a clever man--no denying it--a clever\nman--but there are certain cases--yours, for example--and I think that\nof many that come to drink this water--which I cannot say I think he\nperfectly understands--hasty--very hasty and rapid. Now I--I give the\ndisease its own way at first--then watch it, Mrs. Blower--watch the turn\nof the tide.\"\n\n\"Ay, troth, that's true,\" responded the widow; \"John Blower was aye\nwatching turn of tide, puir man.\"\n\n\"Then he is a starving doctor, Mrs. Blower--reduces diseases as soldiers\ndo towns--by famine, not considering that the friendly inhabitants\nsuffer as much as the hostile garrison--ahem!\"\n\nHere he gave an important and emphatic cough, and then proceeded.\n\n\"I am no friend either to excess or to violent stimulus, Mrs.\nBlower--but nature must be supported--a generous diet--cordials\njudiciously thrown in--not without the advice of a medical man--that is\nmy opinion, Mrs. Blower, to speak as a friend--others may starve their\npatients if they have a mind.\"\n\n\"It wadna do for me, the starving, Dr. Keekerben,\" said the alarmed\nrelict,--\"it wadna do for me at a'--Just a' I can do to wear through the\nday with the sma' supports that nature requires--not a soul to look\nafter me, Doctor, since John Blower was ta'en awa.--Thank ye kindly,\nsir,\" (to the servant who handed the tea,)--\"thank ye, my bonny man,\"\n(to the page who served the cake)--\"Now, dinna ye think, Doctor,\" (in a\nlow and confidential voice,) \"that her leddyship's tea is rather of the\nweakliest--water bewitched, I think--and Mrs. Jones, as they ca' her,\nhas cut the seedcake very thin?\"\n\n\"It is the fashion, Mrs. Blower,\" answered Dr. Quackleben; \"and her\nladyship's tea is excellent. But your taste is a little chilled, which\nis not uncommon at the first use of the waters, so that you are not\nsensible of the flavour--we must support the system--reinforce the\ndigestive powers--give me leave--you are a stranger, Mrs. Blower, and we\nmust take care of you--I have an elixir which will put that matter to\nrights in a moment.\"\n\nSo saying, Dr. Quackleben pulled from his pocket a small portable case\nof medicines--\"Catch me without my tools,\"--he said; \"here I have the\nreal useful pharmacopoeia--the rest is all humbug and hard names--this\nlittle case, with a fortnight or month, spring and fall, at St. Ronan's\nWell, and no one will die till his day come.\"\n\nThus boasting, the Doctor drew from his case a large vial or small\nflask, full of a high-coloured liquid, of which he mixed three\ntea-spoonfuls in Mrs. Blower's cup, who, immediately afterwards, allowed\nthat the flavour was improved beyond all belief, and that it was \"vera\ncomfortable and restorative indeed.\"\n\n\"Will it not do good to my complaints, Doctor?\" said Mr. Winterblossom,\nwho had strolled towards them, and held out his cup to the physician.\n\n\"I by no means recommend it, Mr. Winterblossom,\" said Dr. Quackleben,\nshutting up his case with great coolness; \"your case is oedematous,\nand you treat it your own way--you are as good a physician as I am, and\nI never interfere with another practitioner's patient.\"\n\n\"Well, Doctor,\" said Winterblossom, \"I must wait till Sir Bingo comes\nin--he has a hunting-flask usually about him, which contains as good\nmedicine as yours to the full.\"\n\n\"You will wait for Sir Bingo some time,\" said the Doctor; \"he is a\ngentleman of sedentary habits--he has ordered another magnum.\"\n\n\"Sir Bingo is an unco name for a man o' quality, dinna ye think sae, Dr.\nCocklehen?\" said Mrs. Blower. \"John Blower, when he was a wee bit in the\nwind's eye, as he ca'd it, puir fallow--used to sing a sang about a dog\nthey ca'd Bingo, that suld hae belanged to a farmer.\"\n\n\"Our Bingo is but a puppy yet, madam--or if a dog, he is a sad dog,\"\nsaid Mr. Winterblossom, applauding his own wit, by one of his own\ninimitable smiles.\n\n\"Or a mad dog, rather,\" said Mr. Chatterly, \"for he drinks no water;\"\nand he also smiled gracefully at the thoughts of having trumped, as it\nwere, the president's pun.\n\n\"Twa pleasant men, Doctor,\" said the widow, \"and so is Sir Bungy too,\nfor that matter; but O! is nae it a pity he should bide sae lang by the\nbottle? It was puir John Blower's faut too, that weary tippling; when he\nwan to the lee-side of a bowl of punch, there was nae raising him.--But\nthey are taking awa the things, and, Doctor, is it not an awfu' thing\nthat the creature-comforts should hae been used without grace or\nthanksgiving?--that Mr. Chitterling, if he really be a minister, has\nmuckle to answer for, that he neglects his Master's service.\"\n\n\"Why, madam,\" said the Doctor, \"Mr. Chatterly is scarce arrived at the\nrank of a minister plenipotentiary.\"\n\n\"A minister potentiary--ah, Doctor, I doubt that is some jest of yours,\"\nsaid the widow; \"that's sae like puir John Blower. When I wad hae had\nhim gie up the lovely Peggy, ship and cargo, (the vessel was named after\nme, Doctor Kittleben,) to be remembered in the prayers o' the\ncongregation, he wad say to me, 'they may pray that stand the risk,\nPeggy Bryce, for I've made insurance.' He was a merry man, Doctor; but\nhe had the root of the matter in him, for a' his light way of speaking,\nas deep as ony skipper that ever loosed anchor from Leith Roads. I hae\nbeen a forsaken creature since his death--O the weary days and nights\nthat I have had!--and the weight on the spirits--the spirits,\nDoctor!--though I canna say I hae been easier since I hae been at the\nWall than even now--if I kend what I was awing ye for elickstir, Doctor,\nfor it's done me muckle heart's good, forby the opening of my mind to\nyou.\"\n\n\"Fie, fie, ma'am,\" said the Doctor, as the widow pulled out a seal-skin\npouch, such as sailors carry tobacco in, but apparently well stuffed\nwith bank-notes,--\"Fie, fie, madam--I am no apothecary--I have my\ndiploma from Leyden--a regular physician, madam,--the elixir is heartily\nat your service; and should you want any advice, no man will be prouder\nto assist you than your humble servant.\"\n\n\"I am sure I am muckle obliged to your kindness, Dr. Kickalpin,\" said\nthe widow, folding up her pouch; \"this was puir John Blower's\n_spleuchan_,[I-16] as they ca' it--I e'en wear it for his sake. He was a\nkind man, and left me comfortable in warld's gudes; but comforts hae\ntheir cumbers,--to be a lone woman is a sair weird, Dr. Kittlepin.\"\n\nDr. Quackleben drew his chair a little nearer that of the widow, and\nentered into a closer communication with her, in a tone doubtless of\nmore delicate consolation than was fit for the ears of the company at\nlarge.\n\nOne of the chief delights of a watering-place is, that every one's\naffairs seem to be put under the special surveillance of the whole\ncompany, so that, in all probability, the various flirtations,\n_liaisons_, and so forth, which naturally take place in the society, are\nnot only the subject of amusement to the parties engaged, but also to\nthe lookers on; that is to say, generally speaking, to the whole\ncommunity, of which for the time the said parties are members. Lady\nPenelope, the presiding goddess of the region, watchful over all her\ncircle, was not long of observing that the Doctor seemed to be suddenly\nengaged in close communication with the widow, and that he had even\nventured to take hold of her fair plump hand, with a manner which\npartook at once of the gallant suitor, and of the medical adviser.\n\n\"For the love of Heaven,\" said her ladyship, \"who can that comely dame\nbe, on whom our excellent and learned Doctor looks with such uncommon\nregard?\"\n\n\"Fat, fair, and forty,\" said Mr. Winterblossom; \"that is all I know of\nher--a mercantile person.\"\n\n\"A carrack, Sir President,\" said the chaplain, \"richly laden with\ncolonial produce, by name the Lovely Peggy Bryce--no master--the late\nJohn Blower of North Leith having pushed off his boat for the Stygian\nCreek, and left the vessel without a hand on board.\"\n\n\"The Doctor,\" said Lady Penelope, turning her glass towards them, \"seems\nwilling to play the part of pilot.\"\n\n\"I dare say he will be willing to change her name and register,\" said\nMr. Chatterly.\n\n\"He can be no less in common requital,\" said Winterblossom. \"She has\nchanged _his_ name six times in the five minutes that I stood within\nhearing of them.\"\n\n\"What do you think of the matter, my dear Lady Binks?\" said Lady\nPenelope.\n\n\"Madam?\" said Lady Binks, starting from a reverie, and answering as one\nwho either had not heard, or did not understand the question.\n\n\"I mean, what think you of what is going on yonder?\"\n\nLady Binks turned her glass in the direction of Lady Penelope's glance,\nfixed the widow and the Doctor with one bold fashionable stare, and then\ndropping her hand slowly, said with indifference, \"I really see nothing\nthere worth thinking about.\"\n\n\"I dare say it is a fine thing to be married,\" said Lady Penelope;\n\"one's thoughts, I suppose, are so much engrossed with one's own perfect\nhappiness, that they have neither time nor inclination to laugh like\nother folks. Miss Rachel Bonnyrigg would have laughed till her eyes ran\nover, had she seen what Lady Binks cares so little about--I dare say it\nmust be an all-sufficient happiness to be married.\"\n\n\"He would be a happy man that could convince your ladyship of that in\ngood earnest,\" said Mr. Winterblossom.\n\n\"Oh, who knows--the whim may strike me,\" replied the lady; \"but\nno--no--no;--and that is three times.\"\n\n\"Say it sixteen times more,\" said the gallant president, \"and let\nnineteen nay-says be a grant.\"\n\n\"If I should say a thousand Noes, there exists not the alchymy in living\nman that could extract one Yes out of the whole mass,\" said her\nladyship. \"Blessed be the memory of Queen Bess!--She set us all an\nexample to keep power when we have it--What noise is that?\"\n\n\"Only the usual after-dinner quarrel,\" said the divine. \"I hear the\nCaptain's voice, else most silent, commanding them to keep peace, in the\ndevil's name and that of the ladies.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, dearest Lady Binks, this is too bad of that lord and\nmaster of yours, and of Mowbray, who might have more sense, and of the\nrest of that claret-drinking set, to be quarrelling and alarming our\nnerves every evening with presenting their pistols perpetually at each\nother, like sportsmen confined to the house upon a rainy 12th of August.\nI am tired of the Peace-maker--he but skins the business over in one\ncase to have it break out elsewhere.--What think you, love, if we were\nto give out in orders, that the next quarrel which may arise, shall be\n_bona fide_ fought to an end?--We will all go out and see it, and wear\nthe colours on each side; and if there should a funeral come of it, we\nwill attend it in a body.--Weeds are so becoming!--Are they not, my dear\nLady Binks? Look at Widow Blower in her deep black--don't you envy her,\nmy love?\"\n\nLady Binks seemed about to make a sharp and hasty answer, but checked\nherself, perhaps under the recollection that she could not prudently\ncome to an open breach with Lady Penelope.--At the same moment the door\nopened, and a lady dressed in a riding-habit, and wearing a black veil\nover her hat, appeared at the entry of the apartment.\n\n\"Angels and ministers of grace!\" exclaimed Lady Penelope, with her very\nbest tragic start--\"my dearest Clara, why so late? and why thus? Will\nyou step to my dressing-room--Jones will get you one of my gowns--we are\njust of a size, you know--do, pray--let me be vain of something of my\nown for once, by seeing you wear it.\"\n\nThis was spoken in the tone of the fondest female friendship, and at the\nsame time the fair hostess bestowed on Miss Mowbray one of those tender\ncaresses, which ladies--God bless them!--sometimes bestow on each other\nwith unnecessary prodigality, to the great discontent and envy of the\nmale spectators.\n\n\"You are fluttered, my dearest Clara--you are feverish--I am sure you\nare,\" continued the sweetly anxious Lady Penelope; \"let me persuade you\nto lie down.\"\n\n\"Indeed you are mistaken, Lady Penelope,\" said Miss Mowbray, who seemed\nto receive much as a matter of course her ladyship's profusion of\naffectionate politeness:--\"I am heated, and my pony trotted hard, that\nis the whole mystery.--Let me have a cup of tea, Mrs. Jones, and the\nmatter is ended.\"\n\n\"Fresh tea, Jones, directly,\" said Lady Penelope, and led her passive\nfriend to her own corner, as she was pleased to call the recess, in\nwhich she held her little court--ladies and gentlemen curtsying and\nbowing as she passed; to which civilities the new guest made no more\nreturn, than the most ordinary politeness rendered unavoidable.\n\nLady Binks did not rise to receive her, but sat upright in her chair,\nand bent her head very stiffly; a courtesy which Miss Mowbray returned\nin the same stately manner, without farther greeting on either side.\n\n\"Now, wha can that be, Doctor?\" said the Widow Blower--\"mind ye have\npromised to tell me all about the grand folk--wha can that be that Leddy\nPenelope hauds such a racket wi'?--and what for does she come wi' a\nhabit and a beaver-hat, when we are a' (a glance at her own gown) in our\nsilks and satins?\"\n\n\"To tell you who she is, my dear Mrs. Blower, is very easy,\" said the\nofficious Doctor. \"She is Miss Clara Mowbray, sister to the Lord of the\nManor--the gentleman who wears the green coat, with an arrow on the\ncape. To tell why she wears that habit, or does any thing else, would be\nrather beyond doctor's skill. Truth is, I have always thought she was a\nlittle--a very little--touched--call it nerves--hypochondria--or what\nyou will.\"\n\n\"Lord help us, puir thing!\" said the compassionate widow.--\"And troth it\nlooks like it. But it's a shame to let her go loose, Doctor--she might\nhurt hersell, or somebody. See, she has ta'en the knife!--O, it's only\nto cut a shave of the diet-loaf. She winna let the powder-monkey of a\nboy help her. There's judgment in that though, Doctor, for she can cut\nthick or thin as she likes.--Dear me! she has not taken mair than a\ncrumb, than ane would pit between the wires of a canary-bird's cage,\nafter all.--I wish she would lift up that lang veil, or put off that\nriding-skirt, Doctor. She should really be showed the regulations,\nDoctor Kickelshin.\"\n\n\"She cares about no rules we can make, Mrs. Blower,\" said the Doctor;\n\"and her brother's will and pleasure, and Lady Penelope's whim of\nindulging her, carry her through in every thing. They should take\nadvice on her case.\"\n\n\"Ay, truly, it's time to take advice, when young creatures like her\ncaper in amang dressed leddies, just as if they were come from\nscampering on Leith sands.--Such a wark as my leddy makes wi' her,\nDoctor! Ye would think they were baith fools of a feather.\"\n\n\"They might have flown on one wing, for what I know,\" said Dr.\nQuackleben; \"but there was early and sound advice taken in Lady\nPenelope's case. My friend, the late Earl of Featherhead, was a man of\njudgment--did little in his family but by rule of medicine--so that,\nwhat with the waters, and what with my own care, Lady Penelope is only\nfreakish--fanciful--that's all--and her quality bears it out--the\npeccant principle might have broken out under other treatment.\"\n\n\"Ay--she has been weel-friended,\" said the widow; \"but this bairn\nMowbray, puir thing! how came she to be sae left to hersell?\"\n\n\"Her mother was dead--her father thought of nothing but his sports,\"\nsaid the Doctor. \"Her brother was educated in England, and cared for\nnobody but himself, if he had been here. What education she got was at\nher own hand--what reading she read was in a library full of old\nromances--what friends or company she had was what chance sent her--then\nno family-physician, not even a good surgeon, within ten miles! And so\nyou cannot wonder if the poor thing became unsettled.\"\n\n\"Puir thing!--no doctor!--nor even a surgeon!--But, Doctor,\" said the\nwidow, \"maybe the puir thing had the enjoyment of her health, ye ken,\nand, then\"----\n\n\"Ah! ha, ha!--why _then_, madam, she needed a physician far more than if\nshe had been delicate. A skilful physician, Mrs. Blower, knows how to\nbring down that robust health, which is a very alarming state of the\nframe when it is considered _secundum artem_. Most sudden deaths happen\nwhen people are in a robust state of health. Ah! that state of perfect\nhealth is what the doctor dreads most on behalf of his patient.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, Doctor?--I am quite sensible, nae doubt,\" said the widow, \"of\nthe great advantage of having a skeelfu' person about ane.\"\n\nHere the Doctor's voice, in his earnestness to convince Mrs. Blower of\nthe danger of supposing herself capable of living and breathing without\na medical man's permission, sunk into a soft pleading tone, of which our\nreporter could not catch the sound. He was, as great orators will\nsometimes be, \"inaudible in the gallery.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Lady Penelope overwhelmed Clara Mowbray with her caresses. In\nwhat degree her ladyship, at her heart, loved this young person, might\nbe difficult to ascertain,--probably in the degree in which a child\nloves a favourite toy. But Clara was a toy not always to be come by--as\nwhimsical in her way as her ladyship in her own, only that poor Clara's\nsingularities were real, and her ladyship's chiefly affected. Without\nadopting the harshness of the Doctor's conclusions concerning the\nformer, she was certainly unequal in her spirits; and her occasional\nfits of levity were chequered by very long intervals of sadness. Her\nlevity also appeared, in the world's eye, greater than it really was;\nfor she had never been under the restraint of society which was really\ngood, and entertained an undue contempt for that which she sometimes\nmingled with; having unhappily none to teach her the important truth,\nthat some forms and restraints are to be observed, less in respect to\nothers than to ourselves. Her dress, her manners, and her ideas, were\ntherefore very much her own; and though they became her wonderfully,\nyet, like Ophelia's garlands, and wild snatches of melody, they were\ncalculated to excite compassion and melancholy, even while they amused\nthe observer.\n\n\"And why came you not to dinner?--We expected you--your throne was\nprepared.\"\n\n\"I had scarce come to tea,\" said Miss Mowbray, \"of my own freewill. But\nmy brother says your ladyship proposes to come to Shaws-Castle, and he\ninsisted it was quite right and necessary, to confirm you in so\nflattering a purpose, that I should come and say, Pray do, Lady\nPenelope; and so now here am I to say, Pray, do come.\"\n\n\"Is an invitation so flattering limited to me alone, my dear\nClara?--Lady Binks will be jealous.\"\n\n\"Bring Lady Binks, if she has the condescension to honour us\"--[a bow\nwas very stiffly exchanged between the ladies]--\"bring Mr.\nSpringblossom--Winterblossom--and all the lions and lionesses--we have\nroom for the whole collection. My brother, I suppose, will bring his own\nparticular regiment of bears, which, with the usual assortment of\nmonkeys seen in all caravans, will complete the menagerie. How you are\nto be entertained at Shaws-Castle, is, I thank Heaven, not my business,\nbut John's.\"\n\n\"We shall want no formal entertainment, my love,\" said Lady Penelope; \"a\n_d\u00c3\u00a9je\u00c3\u00bbner \u00c3\u00a0 la fourchette_--we know, Clara, you would die of doing the\nhonours of a formal dinner.\"\n\n\"Not a bit; I should live long enough to make my will, and bequeath all\nlarge parties to old Nick, who invented them.\"\n\n\"Miss Mowbray,\" said Lady Binks, who had been thwarted by this\nfree-spoken young lady, both in her former character of a coquette and\nromp, and in that of a prude which she at present wore--\"Miss Mowbray\ndeclares for\n\n    'Champagne and a chicken at last.'\"\n\n\"The chicken without the champagne, if you please,\" said Miss Mowbray;\n\"I have known ladies pay dear to have champagne on the board.--By the\nby, Lady Penelope, you have not your collection in the same order and\ndiscipline as Pidcock and Polito. There was much growling and snarling\nin the lower den when I passed it.\"\n\n\"It was feeding-time, my love,\" said Lady Penelope; \"and the lower\nanimals of every class become pugnacious at that hour--you see all our\nsafer and well-conditioned animals are loose, and in good order.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes--in the keeper's presence, you know--Well, I must venture to\ncross the hall again among all that growling and grumbling--I would I\nhad the fairy prince's quarters of mutton to toss among them if they\nshould break out--He, I mean, who fetched water from the Fountain of\nLions. However, on second thoughts, I will take the back way, and avoid\nthem.--What says honest Bottom?--\n\n    'For if they should as lions come in strife\n    Into such place, 'twere pity of their life.'\"\n\n\"Shall I go with you, my dear?\" said Lady Penelope.\n\n\"No--I have too great a soul for that--I think some of them are lions\nonly as far as the hide is concerned.\"\n\n\"But why would you go so soon, Clara?\"\n\n\"Because my errand is finished--have I not invited you and yours? and\nwould not Lord Chesterfield himself allow I have done the polite thing?\"\n\n\"But you have spoke to none of the company--how can you be so odd, my\nlove?\" said her ladyship.\n\n\"Why, I spoke to them all when I spoke to you and Lady Binks--but I am a\ngood girl, and will do as I am bid.\"\n\nSo saying, she looked round the company, and addressed each of them with\nan affectation of interest and politeness, which thinly concealed scorn\nand contempt.\n\n\"Mr. Winterblossom, I hope the gout is better--Mr. Robert Rymar--(I have\nescaped calling him Thomas for once)--I hope the public give\nencouragement to the muses--Mr. Keelavine, I trust your pencil is\nbusy--Mr. Chatterly, I have no doubt your flock improves--Dr.\nQuackleben, I am sure your patients recover--These are all the especials\nof the worthy company I know--for the rest, health to the sick, and\npleasure to the healthy!\"\n\n\"You are not going in reality, my love?\" said Lady Penelope; \"these\nhasty rides agitate your nerves--they do, indeed--you should be\ncautious--Shall I speak to Quackleben?\"\n\n\"To neither Quack nor quackle, on my account, my dear lady. It is not as\nyou would seem to say, by your winking at Lady Binks--it is not,\nindeed--I shall be no Lady Clementina, to be the wonder and pity of the\nspring of St. Ronan's--No Ophelia neither--though I will say with her,\nGood-night, ladies--Good night, sweet ladies!--and now--not my coach, my\ncoach--but my horse, my horse!\"\n\nSo saying, she tripped out of the room by a side passage, leaving the\nladies looking at each other significantly, and shaking their heads with\nan expression of much import.\n\n\"Something has ruffled the poor unhappy girl,\" said Lady Penelope; \"I\nnever saw her so very odd before.\"\n\n\"Were I to speak my mind,\" said Lady Binks, \"I think, as Mrs. Highmore\nsays in the farce, her madness is but a poor excuse for her\nimpertinence.\"\n\n\"Oh fie! my sweet Lady Binks,\" said Lady Penelope, \"spare my poor\nfavourite! You, surely, of all others, should forgive the excesses of an\namiable eccentricity of temper.--Forgive me, my love, but I must defend\nan absent friend--My Lady Binks, I am very sure, is too generous and\ncandid to\n\n    'Hate for arts which caused herself to rise.'\"\n\n\"Not being conscious of any high elevation, my lady,\" answered Lady\nBinks, \"I do not know any arts I have been under the necessity of\npractising to attain it. I suppose a Scotch lady of an ancient family\nmay become the wife of an English baronet, and no very extraordinary\ngreat cause to wonder at it.\"\n\n\"No, surely--but people in this world will, you know, wonder at\nnothing,\" answered Lady Penelope.\n\n\"If you envy me my poor quiz, Sir Bingo, I'll get you a better, Lady\nPen.\"\n\n\"I don't doubt your talents, my dear, but when I want one, I will get\none for myself.--But here comes the whole party of quizzes.--Joliffe,\noffer the gentlemen tea--then get the floor ready for the dancers, and\nset the card-tables in the next room.\"\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[I-15] The late Dr. Gregory is probably intimated, as one of the\ncelebrated Dr. Cullen's personal habits is previously mentioned. Dr.\nGregory was distinguished for putting his patients on a severe regimen.\n\n[I-16] A fur pouch for keeping tobacco.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII.\n\nAFTER DINNER.\n\n    They draw the cork, they broach the barrel,\n    And first they kiss, and then they quarrel.\n\nPRIOR.\n\n\nIf the reader has attended much to the manners of the canine race, he\nmay have remarked the very different manner in which the individuals of\nthe different sexes carry on their quarrels among each other. The\nfemales are testy, petulant, and very apt to indulge their impatient\ndislike of each other's presence, or the spirit of rivalry which it\nproduces, in a sudden bark and snap, which last is generally made as\nmuch at advantage as possible. But these ebullitions of peevishness lead\nto no very serious or prosecuted conflict; the affair begins and ends in\na moment. Not so the ire of the male dogs, which, once produced and\nexcited by growls of mutual offence and defiance, leads generally to a\nfierce and obstinate contest; in which, if the parties be dogs of game,\nand well-matched, they grapple, throttle, tear, roll each other in the\nkennel, and can only be separated by choking them with their own\ncollars, till they lose wind and hold at the same time, or by surprising\nthem out of their wrath by sousing them with cold water.\n\nThe simile, though a currish one, will hold good in its application to\nthe human race. While the ladies in the tea-room of the Fox Hotel were\nengaged in the light snappish velitation, or skirmish, which we have\ndescribed, the gentlemen who remained in the parlour were more than once\nlike to have quarrelled more seriously.\n\nWe have mentioned the weighty reasons which induced Mr. Mowbray to look\nupon the stranger whom a general invitation had brought into their\nsociety, with unfavourable prepossessions; and these were far from being\nabated by the demeanour of Tyrrel, which, though perfectly well-bred,\nindicated a sense of equality, which the young Laird of St. Ronan's\nconsidered as extremely presumptuous.\n\nAs for Sir Bingo, he already began to nourish the genuine hatred always\nentertained by a mean spirit against an antagonist, before whom it is\nconscious of having made a dishonourable retreat. He forgot not the\nmanner, look, and tone, with which Tyrrel had checked his unauthorized\nintrusion; and though he had sunk beneath it at the moment, the\nrecollection rankled in his heart as an affront to be avenged. As he\ndrank his wine, courage, the want of which was, in his more sober\nmoments, a check upon his bad temper, began to inflame his malignity,\nand he ventured upon several occasions to show his spleen, by\ncontradicting Tyrrel more flatly than good manners permitted upon so\nshort an acquaintance, and without any provocation. Tyrrel saw his ill\nhumour and despised it, as that of an overgrown schoolboy, whom it was\nnot worth his while to answer according to his folly.\n\nOne of the apparent causes of the Baronet's rudeness was indeed childish\nenough. The company were talking of shooting, the most animating topic\nof conversation among Scottish country gentlemen of the younger class,\nand Tyrrel had mentioned something of a favourite setter, an uncommonly\nhandsome dog, from which he had been for some time separated, but which\nhe expected would rejoin him in the course of next week.\n\n\"A setter!\" retorted Sir Bingo, with a sneer; \"a pointer I suppose you\nmean?\"\n\n\"No, sir,\" said Tyrrel; \"I am perfectly aware of the difference betwixt\na setter and a pointer, and I know the old-fashioned setter is become\nunfashionable among modern sportsmen. But I love my dog as a companion,\nas well as for his merits in the field; and a setter is more sagacious,\nmore attached, and fitter for his place on the hearth-rug, than a\npointer--not,\" he added, \"from any deficiency of intellects on the\npointer's part, but he is generally so abused while in the management of\nbrutal breakers and grooms, that he loses all excepting his professional\naccomplishments, of finding and standing steady to game.\"\n\n\"And who the d----l desires he should have more?\" said Sir Bingo.\n\n\"Many people, Sir Bingo,\" replied Tyrrel, \"have been of opinion, that\nboth dogs and men may follow sport indifferently well, though they do\nhappen, at the same time, to be fit for mixing in friendly intercourse\nin society.\"\n\n\"That is for licking trenchers, and scratching copper, I suppose,\" said\nthe Baronet, _sotto voce_; and added, in a louder and more distinct\ntone,--\"He never before heard that a setter was fit to follow any man's\nheels but a poacher's.\"\n\n\"You know it now then, Sir Bingo,\" answered Tyrrel; \"and I hope you will\nnot fall into so great a mistake again.\"\n\nThe Peace-maker here seemed to think his interference necessary, and,\nsurmounting his tactiturnity, made the following pithy speech:--\"By Cot!\nand do you see, as you are looking for my opinion, I think there is no\ndispute in the matter--because, by Cot! it occurs to me, d'ye see, that\nye are both right, by Cot! It may do fery well for my excellent friend\nSir Bingo, who hath stables, and kennels, and what not, to maintain the\nsix filthy prutes that are yelping and yowling all the tay, and all the\nneight too, under my window, by Cot!--And if they are yelping and\nyowling there, may I never die but I wish they were yelping and yowling\nsomewhere else. But then there is many a man who may be as cood a\ngentleman at the bottom as my worthy friend Sir Bingo, though it may be\nthat he is poor; and if he is poor--and as if it might be my own case,\nor that of this honest gentleman, Mr. Tirl--is that a reason or a law,\nthat he is not to keep a prute of a tog, to help him to take his sports\nand his pleasures? and if he has not a stable or a kennel to put the\ncrature into, must he not keep it in his pit of ped-room, or upon his\nparlour hearth, seeing that Luckie Dods would make the kitchen too hot\nfor the paist--and so, if Mr. Tirl finds a setter more fitter for his\npurpose than a pointer, by Cot, I know no law against it, else may I\nnever die the black death.\"\n\nIf this oration appear rather long for the occasion, the reader must\nrecollect that Captain MacTurk had in all probability the trouble of\ntranslating it from the periphrastic language of Ossian, in which it was\noriginally conceived in his own mind.\n\nThe Man of Law replied to the Man of Peace, \"Ye are mistaken for ance in\nyour life, Captain, for there is a law against setters; and I will\nundertake to prove them to be the 'lying dogs,' which are mentioned in\nthe auld Scots statute, and which all and sundry are discharged to keep,\nunder a penalty of\"----\n\nHere the Captain broke in, with a very solemn mien and dignified\nmanner--\"By Cot! Master Meiklewham, and I shall be asking what you mean\nby talking to me of peing mistaken, and apout lying togs, sir--because I\nwould have you to know, and to pelieve, and to very well consider, that\nI never was mistaken in my life, sir, unless it was when I took you for\na gentleman.\"\n\n\"No offence, Captain,\" said Mr. Meiklewham; \"dinna break the wand of\npeace, man, you that should be the first to keep it.--He is as\ncankered,\" continued the Man of Law, apart to his patron, \"as an auld\nHieland terrier, that snaps at whatever comes near it--but I tell you ae\nthing, St. Ronan's, and that is on saul and conscience, that I believe\nthis is the very lad Tirl, that I raised a summons against before the\njustices--him and another hempie--in your father's time, for shooting on\nthe Spring-well-head muirs.\"\n\n\"The devil you did, Mick!\" replied the Lord of the Manor, also\naside;--\"Well, I am obliged to you for giving me some reason for the ill\nthoughts I had of him--I knew he was some trumpery scamp--I'll blow him,\nby\"----\n\n\"Whisht--stop--hush--haud your tongue, St. Ronan's,--keep a calm\nsough--ye see, I intended the process, by your worthy father's desire,\nbefore the Quarter Sessions--but I ken na--The auld sheriff-clerk stood\nthe lad's friend--and some of the justices thought it was but a mistake\nof the marches, and sae we couldna get a judgment--and your father was\nvery ill of the gout, and I was feared to vex him, and so I was fain to\nlet the process sleep, for fear they had been assoilzied.--Sae ye had\nbetter gang cautiously to wark, St. Ronan's, for though they were\nsummoned, they were not convict.\"\n\n\"Could you not take up the action again?\" said Mr. Mowbray.\n\n\"Whew! it's been prescribed sax or seeven year syne. It is a great\nshame, St. Ronan's, that the game laws, whilk are the very best\nprotection that is left to country gentlemen against the encroachment of\ntheir inferiors, rin sae short a course of prescription--a poacher may\njust jink ye back and forward like a flea in a blanket, (wi'\npardon)--hap ye out of ae county and into anither at their pleasure,\nlike pyots--and unless ye get your thum-nail on them in the very nick o'\ntime, ye may dine on a dish of prescription, and sup upon an\nabsolvitor.\"\n\n\"It is a shame indeed,\" said Mowbray, turning from his confident and\nagent, and addressing himself to the company in general, yet not without\na peculiar look directed to Tyrrel.\n\n\"What is a shame, sir?\" said Tyrrel, conceiving that the observation was\nparticularly addressed to him.\n\n\"That we should have so many poachers upon our muirs, sir,\" answered St.\nRonan's. \"I sometimes regret having countenanced the Well here, when I\nthink how many guns it has brought on my property every season.\"\n\n\"Hout fie! hout awa, St. Ronan's!\" said his Man of Law; \"no countenance\nthe Waal? What would the country-side be without it, I would be glad to\nken? It's the greatest improvement that has been made on this country\nsince the year forty-five. Na, na, it's no the Waal that's to blame for\nthe poaching and delinquencies on the game. We maun to the Aultoun for\nthe howf of that kind of cattle. Our rules at the Waal are clear and\nexpress against trespassers on the game.\"\n\n\"I can't think,\" said the Squire, \"what made my father sell the property\nof the old change-house yonder, to the hag that keeps it open out of\nspite, I think, and to harbour poachers and vagabonds!--I cannot\nconceive what made him do so foolish a thing!\"\n\n\"Probably because your father wanted money, sir,\" said Tyrrel, dryly;\n\"and my worthy landlady, Mrs. Dods, had got some.--You know, I presume,\nsir, that I lodge there?\"\n\n\"Oh, sir,\" replied Mowbray, in a tone betwixt scorn and civility, \"you\ncannot suppose the present company is alluded to; I only presumed to\nmention as a fact, that we have been annoyed with unqualified people\nshooting on our grounds, without either liberty or license. And I hope\nto have her sign taken down for it--that is all.--There was the same\nplague in my father's days, I think, Mick?\"\n\nBut Mr. Meiklewham, who did not like Tyrrel's looks so well as to induce\nhim to become approver on the occasion, replied with an inarticulate\ngrunt, addressed to the company, and a private admonition to his\npatron's own ear, \"to let sleeping dogs lie.\"\n\n\"I can scarce forbear the fellow,\" said St. Ronan's; \"and yet I cannot\nwell tell where my dislike to him lies--but it would be d----d folly to\nturn out with him for nothing; and so, honest Mick, I will be as quiet\nas I can.\"\n\n\"And that you may be so,\" said Meiklewham, \"I think you had best take no\nmore wine.\"\n\n\"I think so too,\" said the Squire; \"for each glass I drink in his\ncompany gives me the heartburn--yet the man is not different from other\nraffs either--but there is a something about him intolerable to me.\"\n\nSo saying, he pushed back his chair from the table, and--_regis ad\nexemplar_--after the pattern of the Laird, all the company arose.\n\nSir Bingo got up with reluctance, which he testified by two or three\ndeep growls, as he followed the rest of the company into the outer\napartment, which served as an entrance-hall, and divided the\ndining-parlour from the tea-room, as it was called. Here, while the\nparty were assuming their hats, for the purpose of joining the ladies'\nsociety, (which old-fashioned folk used only to take up for that of\ngoing into the open air,) Tyrrel asked a smart footman, who stood near,\nto hand him the hat which lay on the table beyond.\n\n\"Call your own servant, sir,\" answered the fellow, with the true\ninsolence of a pampered menial.\n\n\"Your master,\" answered Tyrrel, \"ought to have taught you good manners,\nmy friend, before bringing you here.\"\n\n\"Sir Bingo Binks is my master,\" said the fellow, in the same insolent\ntone as before.\n\n\"Now for it, Bingie,\" said Mowbray, who was aware that the Baronet's\npot-courage had arrived at fighting pitch.\n\n\"Yes!\" said Sir Bingo aloud, and more articulately than usual--\"The\nfellow is my servant--what has any one to say to it?\"\n\n\"I at least have my mouth stopped,\" answered Tyrrel, with perfect\ncomposure. \"I should have been surprised to have found Sir Bingo's\nservant better bred than himself.\"\n\n\"What d'ye mean by that, sir?\" said Sir Bingo, coming up in an offensive\nattitude, for he was no mean pupil of the Fives-Court--\"What d'ye mean\nby that? D----n you, sir! I'll serve you out before you can say\ndumpling.\"\n\n\"And I, Sir Bingo, unless you presently lay aside that look and manner,\nwill knock you down before you can cry help.\"\n\nThe visitor held in his hand a slip of oak, with which he gave a\nflourish, that, however slight, intimated some acquaintance with the\nnoble art of single-stick. From this demonstration Sir Bingo thought it\nprudent somewhat to recoil, though backed by a party of friends, who, in\ntheir zeal for his honour, would rather have seen his bones broken in\nconflict bold, than his honour injured by a discreditable retreat; and\nTyrrel seemed to have some inclination to indulge them. But, at the very\ninstant when his hand was raised with a motion of no doubtful import, a\nwhispering voice, close to his ear, pronounced the emphatic words--\"Are\nyou a man?\"\n\nNot the thrilling tone with which our inimitable Siddons used to\nelectrify the scene, when she uttered the same whisper, ever had a more\npowerful effect upon an auditor, than had these unexpected sounds on\nhim, to whom they were now addressed. Tyrrel forgot every thing--his\nquarrel--the circumstances in which he was placed--the company. The\ncrowd was to him at once annihilated, and life seemed to have no other\nobject than to follow the person who had spoken. But suddenly as he\nturned, the disappearance of the monitor was at least equally so, for,\namid the group of commonplace countenances by which he was surrounded,\nthere was none which assorted to the tone and words, which possessed\nsuch a power over him. \"Make way,\" he said, to those who surrounded him;\nand it was in the tone of one who was prepared, if necessary, to make\nway for himself.\n\nMr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's stepped forward. \"Come, sir,\" said he, \"this\nwill not do--you have come here, a stranger among us, to assume airs and\ndignities, which, by G--d, would become a duke, or a prince! We must\nknow who or what you are, before we permit you to carry your high tone\nany farther.\"\n\nThis address seemed at once to arrest Tyrrel's anger, and his impatience\nto leave the company. He turned to Mowbray, collected his thoughts for\nan instant, and then answered him thus:--\"Mr. Mowbray, I seek no quarrel\nwith any one here--with you, in particular, I am most unwilling to have\nany disagreement. I came here by invitation, not certainly expecting\nmuch pleasure, but, at the same time, supposing myself secure from\nincivility. In the last point, I find myself mistaken, and therefore\nwish the company good-night. I must also make my adieus to the ladies.\"\n\nSo saying, he walked several steps, yet, as it seemed, rather\nirresolutely, towards the door of the card-room--and then, to the\nincreased surprise of the company, stopped suddenly, and muttering\nsomething about the \"unfitness of the time,\" turned on his heel, and\nbowing haughtily, as there was way made for him, walked in the opposite\ndirection towards the door which led to the outer hall.\n\n\"D----me, Sir Bingo, will you let him off?\" said Mowbray, who seemed to\ndelight in pushing his friend into new scrapes--\"To him, man--to him--he\nshows the white feather.\"\n\nSir Bingo, thus encouraged, planted himself with a look of defiance\nexactly between Tyrrel and the door; upon which the retreating guest,\nbestowing on him most emphatically the epithet Fool, seized him by the\ncollar, and flung him out of his way with some violence.\n\n\"I am to be found at the Old Town of St. Ronan's by whomsoever has any\nconcern with me.\"--Without waiting the issue of this aggression farther\nthan to utter these words, Tyrrel left the hotel. He stopped in the\ncourt-yard, however, with the air of one uncertain whither he intended\nto go, and who was desirous to ask some question, which seemed to die\nupon his tongue. At length his eye fell upon a groom, who stood not far\nfrom the door of the inn, holding in his hand a handsome pony, with a\nside-saddle.\n\n\"Whose\"----said Tyrrel--but the rest of the question he seemed unable to\nutter.\n\nThe man, however, replied, as if he had heard the whole\ninterrogation.--\"Miss Mowbray's, sir, of St. Ronan's--she leaves\ndirectly--and so I am walking the pony--a clever thing, sir, for a\nlady.\"\n\n\"She returns to Shaws-Castle by the Buck-stane road?\"\n\n\"I suppose so, sir,\" said the groom. \"It is the nighest, and Miss Clara\ncares little for rough roads. Zounds! She can spank it over wet and\ndry.\"\n\nTyrrel turned away from the man, and hastily left the hotel--not,\nhowever, by the road which led to the Aultoun, but by a footpath among\nthe natural copsewood, which, following the course of the brook,\nintersected the usual horse-road to Shaws-Castle, the seat of Mr.\nMowbray, at a romantic spot called the Buck-stane.\n\nIn a small peninsula, formed by a winding of the brook, was situated, on\na rising hillock, a large rough-hewn pillar of stone, said by tradition\nto commemorate the fall of a stag of unusual speed, size, and strength,\nwhose flight, after having lasted through a whole summer's day, had\nthere terminated in death, to the honour and glory of some ancient baron\nof St. Ronan's, and of his stanch hounds. During the periodical cuttings\nof the copse, which the necessities of the family of St. Ronan's brought\nround more frequently than Ponty would have recommended, some oaks had\nbeen spared in the neighbourhood of this massive obelisk, old enough\nperhaps to have heard the whoop and halloo which followed the fall of\nthe stag, and to have witnessed the raising of the rude monument by\nwhich that great event was commemorated. These trees, with their broad\nspreading boughs, made a twilight even of noon-day; and, now that the\nsun was approaching its setting point, their shade already anticipated\nnight. This was especially the case where three or four of them\nstretched their arms over a deep gully, through which winded the\nhorse-path to Shaws-Castle, at a point about a pistol-shot distant from\nthe Buck-stane. As the principal access to Mr. Mowbray's mansion was by\na carriage-way, which passed in a different direction, the present path\nwas left almost in a state of nature, full of large stones, and broken\nby gullies, delightful, from the varied character of its banks, to the\npicturesque traveller, and most inconvenient, nay dangerous, to him who\nhad a stumbling horse.\n\nThe footpath to the Buck-stane, which here joined the bridle-road, had\nbeen constructed, at the expense of a subscription, under the direction\nof Mr. Winterblossom, who had taste enough to see the beauties of this\nsecluded spot, which was exactly such as in earlier times might have\nharboured the ambush of some marauding chief. This recollection had not\nescaped Tyrrel, to whom the whole scenery was familiar, who now hastened\nto the spot, as one which peculiarly suited his present purpose. He sat\ndown by one of the larger projecting trees, and, screened by its\nenormous branches from observation, was enabled to watch the road from\nthe Hotel for a great part of its extent, while he was himself invisible\nto any who might travel upon it.\n\nMeanwhile his sudden departure excited a considerable sensation among\nthe party whom he had just left, and who were induced to form\nconclusions not very favourable to his character. Sir Bingo, in\nparticular, blustered loudly and more loudly, in proportion to the\nincreasing distance betwixt himself and his antagonist, declaring his\nresolution to be revenged on the scoundrel for his insolence--to drive\nhim from the neighbourhood--and I know not what other menaces of\nformidable import. The devil, in the old stories of _di\u00c3\u00a0blerie_, was\nalways sure to start up at the elbow of any one who nursed diabolical\npurposes, and only wanted a little backing from the foul fiend to carry\nhis imaginations into action. The noble Captain MacTurk had so far this\nproperty of his infernal majesty, that the least hint of an approaching\nquarrel drew him always to the vicinity of the party concerned. He was\nnow at Sir Bingo's side, and was taking his own view of the matter, in\nhis character of peace-maker.\n\n\"By Cot! and it's very exceedingly true, my goot friend, Sir Binco--and\nas you say, it concerns your honour, and the honour of the place, and\ncredit and character of the whole company, by Cot! that this matter be\nproperly looked after; for, as I think, he laid hands on your body, my\nexcellent goot friend.\"\n\n\"Hands, Captain MacTurk!\" exclaimed Sir Bingo, in some confusion; \"no,\nblast him--not so bad as that neither--if he had, I should have handed\n_him_ over the window--but, by ----, the fellow had the impudence to\noffer to collar me--I had just stepped back to square at him, when,\ncurse me, the blackguard ran away.\"\n\n\"Right, vara right, Sir Bingo,\" said the Man of Law, \"a vara perfect\nblackguard, a poaching sorning sort of fallow, that I will have scoured\nout of the country before he be three days aulder. Fash you your beard\nnae farther about the matter, Sir Bingo.\"\n\n\"By Cot! but I can tell you, Mr. Meiklewham,\" said the Man of Peace,\nwith great solemnity of visage, \"that you are scalding your lips in\nother folk's kale, and that it is necessary for the credit, and honour,\nand respect of this company, at the Well of St. Ronan's, that Sir Bingo\ngoes by more competent advice than yours upon the present occasion, Mr.\nMeiklewham; for though your counsel may do very well in a small debt\ncourt, here, you see, Mr. Meiklewham, is a question of honour, which is\nnot a thing in your line, as I take it.\"\n\n\"No, before George! it is not,\" answered Meiklewham; \"e'en take it all\nto yoursell, Captain, and meikle ye are likely to make on't.\"\n\n\"Then,\" said the Captain, \"Sir Binco, I will beg the favour of your\ncompany to the smoking room, where we may have a cigar and a glass of\ngin-twist; and we will consider how the honour of the company must be\nsupported and upholden upon the present conjuncture.\"\n\nThe Baronet complied with this invitation, as much, perhaps, in\nconsequence of the medium through which the Captain intended to convey\nhis warlike counsels, as for the pleasure with which he anticipated the\nresult of these counsels themselves. He followed the military step of\nhis leader, whose stride was more stiff, and his form more\nperpendicular, when exalted by the consciousness of an approaching\nquarrel, to the smoking-room, where, sighing as he lighted his cigar,\nSir Bingo prepared to listen to the words of wisdom and valour, as they\nshould flow in mingled stream from the lips of Captain MacTurk.\n\nMeanwhile the rest of the company joined the ladies. \"Here has been\nClara,\" said Lady Penelope to Mr. Mowbray; \"here has been Miss Mowbray\namong us, like the ray of a sun which does but dazzle and die.\"\n\n\"Ah, poor Clara,\" said Mowbray; \"I thought I saw her thread her way\nthrough the crowd a little while since, but I was not sure.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Lady Penelope, \"she has asked us all up to Shaws-Castle on\nThursday, to a _d\u00c3\u00a9je\u00c3\u00bbner \u00c3\u00a0 la fourchette_--I trust you confirm your\nsister's invitation, Mr. Mowbray?\"\n\n\"Certainly, Lady Penelope,\" replied Mowbray; \"and I am truly glad Clara\nhas had the grace to think of it--How we shall acquit ourselves is a\ndifferent question, for neither she nor I are much accustomed to play\nhost or hostess.\"\n\n\"Oh! it will be delightful, I am sure,\" said Lady Penelope; \"Clara has a\ngrace in every thing she does; and you, Mr. Mowbray, can be a perfectly\nwell-bred gentleman--when you please.\"\n\n\"That qualification is severe--Well--good manners be my speed--I will\ncertainly please to do my best, when I see your ladyship at\nShaws-Castle, which has received no company this many a day.--Clara and\nI have lived a wild life of it, each in their own way.\"\n\n\"Indeed, Mr. Mowbray,\" said Lady Binks, \"if I might presume to speak--I\nthink you do suffer your sister to ride about a little too much without\nan attendant. I know Miss Mowbray rides as woman never rode before, but\nstill an accident may happen.\"\n\n\"An accident?\" replied Mowbray--\"Ah, Lady Binks! accidents happen as\nfrequently when ladies _have_ attendants as when they are without them.\"\n\nLady Binks, who, in her maiden state, had cantered a good deal about\nthese woods under Sir Bingo's escort, coloured, looked spiteful, and was\nsilent.\n\n\"Besides,\" said John Mowbray, more lightly, \"where is the risk, after\nall? There are no wolves in our woods to eat up our pretty Red-Riding\nHoods; and no lions either--except those of Lady Penelope's train.\"\n\n\"Who draw the car of Cybele,\" said Mr. Chatterly.\n\nLady Penelope luckily did not understand the allusion, which was indeed\nbetter intended than imagined.\n\n\"Apropos!\" she said; \"what have you done with the great lion of the day?\nI see Mr. Tyrrel nowhere--Is he finishing an additional bottle with Sir\nBingo?\"\n\n\"Mr. Tyrrel, madam,\" said Mowbray, \"has acted successively the lion\nrampant, and the lion passant: he has been quarrelsome, and he has run\naway--fled from the ire of your doughty knight, Lady Binks.\"\n\n\"I am sure I hope not,\" said Lady Binks; \"my Chevalier's unsuccessful\ncampaigns have been unable to overcome his taste for quarrels--a victory\nwould make a fighting-man of him for life.\"\n\n\"That inconvenience might bring its own consolations,\" said\nWinterblossom, apart to Mowbray; \"quarrellers do not usually live long.\"\n\n\"No, no,\" replied Mowbray, \"the lady's despair, which broke out just\nnow, even in her own despite, is quite natural--absolutely legitimate.\nSir Bingo will give her no chance that way.\"\n\nMowbray then made his bow to Lady Penelope, and in answer to her request\nthat he would join the ball or the card-table, observed, that he had no\ntime to lose; that the heads of the old domestics at Shaws-Castle would\nbe by this time absolutely turned, by the apprehensions of what Thursday\nwas to bring forth; and that as Clara would certainly give no directions\nfor the proper arrangements, it was necessary that he should take that\ntrouble himself.\n\n\"If you ride smartly,\" said Lady Penelope, \"you may save even a\ntemporary alarm, by overtaking Clara, dear creature, ere she gets\nhome--She sometimes suffers her pony to go at will along the lane, as\nslow as Betty Foy's.\"\n\n\"Ah, but then,\" said little Miss Digges, \"Miss Mowbray sometimes gallops\nas if the lark was a snail to her pony--and it quite frights one to see\nher.\"\n\nThe Doctor touched Mrs. Blower, who had approached so as to be on the\nverge of the genteel circle, though she did not venture within it--they\nexchanged sagacious looks, and a most pitiful shake of the head.\nMowbray's eye happened at that moment to glance on them; and doubtless,\nnotwithstanding their hasting to compose their countenances to a\ndifferent expression, he comprehended what was passing through their\nminds;--and perhaps it awoke a corresponding note in his own. He took\nhis hat, and with a cast of thought upon his countenance which it seldom\nwore, left the apartment. A moment afterwards his horse's feet were\nheard spurning the pavement, as he started off at a sharp pace.\n\n\"There is something singular about these Mowbrays to-night,\" said Lady\nPenelope.--\"Clara, poor dear angel, is always particular; but I should\nhave thought Mowbray had too much worldly wisdom to be fanciful.--What\nare you consulting your _souvenir_ for with such attention, my dear Lady\nBinks?\"\n\n\"Only for the age of the moon,\" said her ladyship, putting the little\ntortoise-shell-bound calendar into her reticule; and having done so, she\nproceeded to assist Lady Penelope in the arrangements for the evening.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE MEETING.\n\n    We meet as shadows in the land of dreams,\n    Which speak not but in signs.\n\n_Anonymous._\n\n\nBehind one of the old oaks which we have described in the preceding\nchapter, shrouding himself from observation like a hunter watching for\nhis game, or an Indian for his enemy, but with different, very different\npurpose, Tyrrel lay on his breast near the Buck-stane, his eye on the\nhorse-road which winded down the valley, and his ear alertly awake to\nevery sound which mingled with the passing breeze, or with the ripple of\nthe brook.\n\n\"To have met her in yonder congregated assembly of brutes and\nfools\"--such was a part of his internal reflections,--\"had been little\nless than an act of madness--madness almost equal in its degree to that\ncowardice which has hitherto prevented my approaching her, when our\neventful meeting might have taken place unobserved.--But now--now--my\nresolution is as fixed as the place is itself favourable. I will not\nwait till some chance again shall throw us together, with an hundred\nmalignant eyes to watch, and wonder, and stare, and try in vain to\naccount for the expression of feelings which I might find it impossible\nto suppress.--Hark--hark!--I hear the tread of a horse--No--it was the\nchangeful sound of the water rushing over the pebbles. Surely she cannot\nhave taken the other road to Shaws-Castle!--No--the sounds become\ndistinct--her figure is visible on the path, coming swiftly\nforward.--Have I the courage to show myself?--I have--the hour is come,\nand what must be shall be.\"\n\nYet this resolution was scarcely formed ere it began to fluctuate, when\nhe reflected upon the fittest manner of carrying it into execution. To\nshow himself at a distance, might give the lady an opportunity of\nturning back and avoiding the interview which he had determined upon--to\nhide himself till the moment when her horse, in rapid motion, should\npass his lurking-place, might be attended with danger to the rider--and\nwhile he hesitated which course to pursue, there was some chance of his\nmissing the opportunity of presenting himself to Miss Mowbray at all. He\nwas himself sensible of this, formed a hasty and desperate resolution\nnot to suffer the present moment to escape, and, just as the ascent\ninduced the pony to slacken its pace, Tyrrel stood in the middle of the\ndefile, about six yards distant from the young lady.\n\nShe pulled up the reins, and stopped as if arrested by a\nthunderbolt.--\"Clara!\"--\"Tyrrel!\" These were the only words which were\nexchanged between them, until Tyrrel, moving his feet as slowly as if\nthey had been of lead, began gradually to diminish the distance which\nlay betwixt them. It was then that, observing his closer approach, Miss\nMowbray called out with great eagerness,--\"No nearer--no nearer!--So\nlong have I endured your presence, but if you approach me more closely,\nI shall be mad indeed!\"\n\n\"What do you fear?\" said Tyrrel, in a hollow voice--\"What can you fear?\"\nand he continued to draw nearer, until they were within a pace of each\nother.\n\nClara, meanwhile, dropping her bridle, clasped her hands together, and\nheld them up towards Heaven, muttering, in a voice scarcely audible,\n\"Great God!--If this apparition be formed by my heated fancy, let it\npass away; if it be real, enable me to bear its presence!--Tell me, I\nconjure you, are you Francis Tyrrel in blood and body, or is this but\none of those wandering visions, that have crossed my path and glared on\nme, but without daring to abide my steadfast glance?\"\n\n\"I am Francis Tyrrel,\" answered he, \"in blood and body, as much as she\nto whom I speak is Clara Mowbray.\"\n\n\"Then God have mercy on us both!\" said Clara, in a tone of deep feeling.\n\n\"Amen!\" said Tyrrel.--\"But what avails this excess of agitation?--You\nsaw me but now, Miss Mowbray--Your voice still rings in my ears--You saw\nme but now--you spoke to me--and that when I was among strangers--Why\nnot preserve your composure, when we are where no human eye can see--no\nhuman ear can hear?\"\n\n\"Is it so?\" said Clara; \"and was it indeed yourself whom I saw even\nnow?--I thought so, and something I said at the time--but my brain has\nbeen but ill settled since we last met--But I am well now--quite well--I\nhave invited all the people yonder to come to Shaws-Castle--my brother\ndesired me to do it--I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing Mr.\nTyrrel there--though I think there is some old grudge between my brother\nand you.\"\n\n\"Alas! Clara, you mistake. Your brother I have scarcely seen,\" replied\nTyrrel, much distressed, and apparently uncertain in what tone to\naddress her, which might soothe, and not irritate her mental malady, of\nwhich he could now entertain no doubt.\n\n\"True--true,\" she said, after a moment's reflection, \"my brother was\nthen at college. It was my father, my poor father, whom you had some\nquarrel with.--But you will come to Shaws-Castle on Thursday, at two\no'clock?--John will be glad to see you--he can be kind when he\npleases--and then we will talk of old times--I must get on, to have\nthings ready--Good evening.\"\n\nShe would have passed him, but he took gently hold of the rein of her\nbridle.--\"I will walk with you, Clara,\" he said; \"the road is rough and\ndangerous--you ought not to ride fast.--I will walk along with you, and\nwe will talk of former times now, more conveniently than in company.\"\n\n\"True--true--very true, Mr. Tyrrel--it shall be as you say. My brother\nobliges me sometimes to go into company at that hateful place down\nyonder; and I do so because he likes it, and because the folks let me\nhave my own way, and come and go as I list. Do you know, Tyrrel, that\nvery often when I am there, and John has his eye on me, I can carry it\non as gaily as if you and I had never met?\"\n\n\"I would to God we never had,\" said Tyrrel, in a trembling voice, \"since\nthis is to be the end of all!\"\n\n\"And wherefore should not sorrow be the end of sin and of folly? And\nwhen did happiness come of disobedience?--And when did sound sleep visit\na bloody pillow? That is what I say to myself, Tyrrel, and that is what\nyou must learn to say too, and then you will bear your burden as\ncheerfully as I endure mine. If we have no more than our deserts, why\nshould we complain?--You are shedding tears, I think--Is not that\nchildish?--They say it is a relief--if so, weep on, and I will look\nanother way.\"\n\nTyrrel walked on by the pony's side, in vain endeavouring to compose\nhimself so as to reply.\n\n\"Poor Tyrrel,\" said Clara, after she had remained silent for some\ntime--\"Poor Frank Tyrrel!--Perhaps you will say in your turn, Poor\nClara--but I am not so poor in spirit as you--the blast may bend, but it\nshall never break me.\"\n\nThere was another long pause; for Tyrrel was unable to determine with\nhimself in what strain he could address the unfortunate young lady,\nwithout awakening recollections equally painful to her feelings, and\ndangerous, when her precarious state of health was considered. At length\nshe herself proceeded:--\n\n\"What needs all this, Tyrrel?--and indeed, why came you here?--Why did I\nfind you but now brawling and quarrelling among the loudest of the\nbrawlers and quarrellers of yonder idle and dissipated debauchees?--You\nwere used to have more temper--more sense. Another person--ay, another\nthat you and I once knew--he might have committed such a folly, and he\nwould have acted perhaps in character.--But you, who pretend to\nwisdom--for shame, for shame!--And indeed, when we talk of that, what\nwisdom was there in coming hither at all?--or what good purpose can your\nremaining here serve?--Surely you need not come, either to renew your\nown unhappiness or to augment mine?\"\n\n\"To augment yours--God forbid!\" answered Tyrrel. \"No--I came hither only\nbecause, after so many years of wandering, I longed to revisit the spot\nwhere all my hopes lay buried.\"\n\n\"Ay--buried is the word,\" she replied, \"crushed down and buried when\nthey budded fairest. I often think of it, Tyrrel; and there are times\nwhen, Heaven help me! I can think of little else.--Look at me--you\nremember what I was--see what grief and solitude have made me.\"\n\nShe flung back the veil which surrounded her riding-hat, and which had\nhitherto hid her face. It was the same countenance which he had formerly\nknown in all the bloom of early beauty; but though the beauty remained,\nthe bloom was fled for ever. Not the agitation of exercise--not that\nwhich arose from the pain and confusion of this unexpected interview,\nhad called to poor Clara's cheek even the momentary semblance of colour.\nHer complexion was marble-white, like that of the finest piece of\nstatuary.\n\n\"Is it possible?\" said Tyrrel; \"can grief have made such ravages?\"\n\n\"Grief,\" replied Clara, \"is the sickness of the mind, and its sister is\nthe sickness of the body--they are twin-sisters, Tyrrel, and are seldom\nlong separate. Sometimes the body's disease comes first, and dims our\neyes and palsies our hands, before the fire of our mind and of our\nintellect is quenched. But mark me--soon after comes her cruel sister\nwith her urn, and sprinkles cold dew on our hopes and on our loves, our\nmemory, our recollections, and our feelings, and shows us that they\ncannot survive the decay of our bodily powers.\"\n\n\"Alas!\" said Tyrrel, \"is it come to this?\"\n\n\"To this,\" she replied, speaking from the rapid and irregular train of\nher own ideas, rather than comprehending the purport of his sorrowful\nexclamation,--\"to this it must ever come, while immortal souls are\nwedded to the perishable substance of which our bodies are composed.\nThere is another state, Tyrrel, in which it will be otherwise--God grant\nour time of enjoying it were come!\"\n\nShe fell into a melancholy pause, which Tyrrel was afraid to disturb.\nThe quickness with which she spoke, marked but too plainly the irregular\nsuccession of thought, and he was obliged to restrain the agony of his\nown feelings, rendered more acute by a thousand painful recollections,\nlest, by giving way to his expressions of grief, he should throw her\ninto a still more disturbed state of mind.\n\n\"I did not think,\" she proceeded, \"that after so horrible a separation,\nand so many years, I could have met you thus calmly and reasonably. But\nalthough what we were formerly to each other can never be forgotten, it\nis now all over, and we are only friends--Is it not so?\"\n\nTyrrel was unable to reply.\n\n\"But I must not remain here,\" she said, \"till the evening grows darker\non me.--We shall meet again, Tyrrel--meet as friends--nothing more--You\nwill come up to Shaws-Castle and see me?--no need of secrecy now--my\npoor father is in his grave, and his prejudices sleep with him--my\nbrother John is kind, though he is stern and severe sometimes--Indeed,\nTyrrel, I believe he loves me, though he has taught me to tremble at his\nfrown when I am in spirits, and talk too much--But he loves me, at least\nI think so, for I am sure I love him; and I try to go down amongst them\nyonder, and to endure their folly, and, all things considered, I do\ncarry on the farce of life wonderfully well--We are but actors, you\nknow, and the world but a stage.\"\n\n\"And ours has been a sad and tragic scene,\" said Tyrrel, in the\nbitterness of his heart, unable any longer to refrain from speech.\n\n\"It has indeed--but, Tyrrel, when was it otherwise with engagements\nformed in youth and in folly? You and I would, you know, become men and\nwomen, while we were yet scarcely more than children--We have run, while\nyet in our nonage, through the passions and adventures of youth, and\ntherefore we are now old before our day, and the winter of our life has\ncome on ere its summer was well begun.--O Tyrrel! often and often have I\nthought of this!--Thought of it often? Alas, when will the time come\nthat I shall be able to think of any thing else!\"\n\nThe poor young woman sobbed bitterly, and her tears began to flow with a\nfreedom which they had not probably enjoyed for a length of time. Tyrrel\nwalked on by the side of her horse, which now prosecuted its road\nhomewards, unable to devise a proper mode of addressing the unfortunate\nyoung lady, and fearing alike to awaken her passions and his own.\nWhatever he might have proposed to say, was disconcerted by the plain\nindications that her mind was clouded, more or less slightly, with a\nshade of insanity, which deranged, though it had not destroyed, her\npowers of judgment.\n\nAt length he asked her, with as much calmness as he could assume--if she\nwas contented--if aught could be done to render her situation more\neasy--if there was aught of which she could complain which he might be\nable to remedy? She answered gently, that she was calm and resigned,\nwhen her brother would permit her to stay at home; but that when she was\nbrought into society, she experienced such a change as that which the\nwater of the brook that slumbers in a crystalline pool of the rock may\nbe supposed to feel, when, gliding from its quiet bed, it becomes\ninvolved in the hurry of the cataract.\n\n\"But my brother Mowbray,\" she said, \"thinks he is right,--and perhaps he\nis so. There are things on which we may ponder too long;--and were he\nmistaken, why should I not constrain myself in order to please\nhim--there are so few left to whom I can now give either pleasure or\npain?--I am a gay girl, too, in conversation, Tyrrel--still as gay for a\nmoment, as when you used to chide me for my folly. So, now I have told\nyou all,--I have one question to ask on my part--one question--if I had\nbut breath to ask it--Is _he_ still alive?\"\n\n\"He lives,\" answered Tyrrel, but in a tone so low, that nought but the\neager attention which Miss Mowbray paid could possibly have caught such\nfeeble sounds.\n\n\"Lives!\" she exclaimed,--\"lives!--he lives, and the blood on your hand\nis not then indelibly imprinted--O Tyrrel, did you but know the joy\nwhich this assurance gives to me!\"\n\n\"Joy!\" replied Tyrrel--\"joy, that the wretch lives who has poisoned our\nhappiness for ever?--lives, perhaps, to claim you for his own?\"\n\n\"Never, never shall he--dare he do so,\" replied Clara, wildly, \"while\nwater can drown, while cords can strangle, steel pierce--while there is\na precipice on the hill, a pool in the river--never--never!\"\n\n\"Be not thus agitated, my dearest Clara,\" said Tyrrel; \"I spoke I know\nnot what--he lives indeed--but far distant, and, I trust, never again to\nrevisit Scotland.\"\n\nHe would have said more, but that, agitated with fear or passion, she\nstruck her horse impatiently with her riding-whip. The spirited animal,\nthus stimulated and at the same time restrained, became intractable, and\nreared so much, that Tyrrel, fearful of the consequences, and trusting\nto Clara's skill as a horsewoman, thought he best consulted her safety\nin letting go the rein. The animal instantly sprung forward on the\nbroken and hilly path at a very rapid pace, and was soon lost to\nTyrrel's anxious eyes.\n\nAs he stood pondering whether he ought not to follow Miss Mowbray\ntowards Shaws-Castle, in order to be satisfied that no accident had\nbefallen her on the road, he heard the tread of a horse's feet advancing\nhastily in the same direction, leading from the hotel. Unwilling to be\nobserved at this moment, he stepped aside under shelter of the\nunderwood, and presently afterwards saw Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's,\nfollowed by a groom, ride hastily past his lurking-place, and pursue the\nsame road which had been just taken by his sister. The presence of her\nbrother seemed to assure Miss Mowbray's safety, and so removed Tyrrel's\nchief reason for following her. Involved in deep and melancholy\nreflection upon what had passed, nearly satisfied that his longer\nresidence in Clara's vicinity could only add to her unhappiness and his\nown, yet unable to tear himself from that neighbourhood, or to\nrelinquish feelings which had become entwined with his heart-strings, he\nreturned to his lodgings in the Aultoun, in a state of mind very little\nto be envied.\n\nTyrrel, on entering his apartment, found that it was not lighted, nor\nwere the Abigails of Mrs. Dods quite so alert as a waiter at Long's\nmight have been, to supply him with candles. Unapt at any time to exact\nmuch personal attendance, and desirous to shun at that moment the\nnecessity of speaking to any person whatever, even on the most trifling\nsubject, he walked down into the kitchen to supply himself with what he\nwanted. He did not at first observe that Mrs. Dods herself was present\nin this the very centre of her empire, far less that a lofty air of\nindignation was seated on the worthy matron's brow. At first it only\nvented itself in broken soliloquy and interjections; as, for example,\n\"Vera bonny wark this!--vera creditable wark, indeed!--a decent house to\nbe disturbed at these hours--Keep a public--as weel keep a bedlam!\"\n\nFinding these murmurs attracted no attention, the dame placed herself\nbetwixt her guest and the door, to which he was now retiring with his\nlighted candle, and demanded of him what was the meaning of such\nbehaviour.\n\n\"Of what behaviour, madam?\" said her guest, repeating her question in a\ntone of sternness and impatience so unusual with him, that perhaps she\nwas sorry at the moment that she had provoked him out of his usual\npatient indifference; nay, she might even feel intimidated at the\naltercation she had provoked, for the resentment of a quiet and patient\nperson has always in it something formidable to the professed and\nhabitual grumbler. But her pride was too great to think of a retreat,\nafter having sounded the signal for contest, and so she continued,\nthough in a tone somewhat lowered.\n\n\"Maister Tirl, I wad but just ask you, that are a man of sense, whether\nI hae ony right to take your behaviour weel? Here have you been these\nten days and mair, eating the best, and drinking the best, and taking up\nthe best room in my house; and now to think of your gaun doun and taking\nup with yon idle harebrained cattle at the Waal--I maun e'en be plain\nwi' ye--I like nane of the fair-fashioned folk that can say My Jo and\nthink it no; and therefore\"----\n\n\"Mrs. Dods,\" said Tyrrel, interrupting her, \"I have no time at present\nfor trifles. I am obliged to you for your attention while I have been in\nyour house; but the disposal of my time, here or elsewhere, must be\naccording to my own ideas of pleasure or business--If you are tired of\nme as a guest, send in your bill to-morrow.\"\n\n\"My bill!\" said Mrs. Dods; \"my bill to-morrow! And what for no wait till\nSaturday, when it may be cleared atween us, plack and bawbee, as it was\non Saturday last?\"\n\n\"Well--we will talk of it to-morrow, Mrs. Dods--Good-night.\" And he\nwithdrew accordingly.\n\nLuckie Dods stood ruminating for a moment. \"The deil's in him,\" she\nsaid, \"for he winna bide being thrawn. And I think the deil's in me too\nfor thrawing him, sic a canny lad, and sae gude a customer;--and I am\njudging he has something on his mind--want of siller it canna be--I am\nsure if I thought that, I wadna care about my small thing.--But want o'\nsiller it canna be--he pays ower the shillings as if they were sclate\nstanes, and that's no the way that folk part with their siller when\nthere's but little on't--I ken weel eneugh how a customer looks that's\nnear the grund of the purse.--Weel! I hope he winna mind ony thing of\nthis nonsense the morn, and I'll try to guide my tongue something\nbetter.--Hegh, sirs! but, as the minister says, it's an unruly\nmember--troth, I am whiles ashamed o't mysell.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nRESOURCES.\n\n    Come, let me have thy counsel, for I need it;\n    Thou art of those, who better help their friends\n    With sage advice, than usurers with gold,\n    Or brawlers with their swords--I'll trust to thee,\n    For I ask only from thee words, not deeds.\n\n_The Devil hath met his Match._\n\n\nThe day of which we last gave the events chanced to be Monday, and two\ndays therefore intervened betwixt it and that for which the\nentertainment was fixed, that was to assemble in the halls of the Lord\nof the Manor the flower of the company now at St. Ronan's Well. The\ninterval was but brief for the preparations necessary on an occasion so\nunusual; since the house, though delightfully situated, was in very\nindifferent repair, and for years had never received any visitors,\nexcept when some blithe bachelor or fox-hunter shared the hospitality of\nMr. Mowbray; an event which became daily more and more uncommon; for, as\nhe himself almost lived at the Well, he generally contrived to receive\nhis companions where it could be done without expense to himself.\nBesides, the health of his sister afforded an irresistible apology to\nany of those old-fashioned Scottish gentlemen, who might be too apt (in\nthe rudeness of more primitive days) to consider a friend's house as\ntheir own. Mr. Mowbray was now, however, to the great delight of all\nhis companions, nailed down, by invitation given and accepted, and they\nlooked forward to the accomplishment of his promise, with the eagerness\nwhich the prospect of some entertaining novelty never fails to produce\namong idlers.\n\nA good deal of trouble devolved on Mr. Mowbray, and his trusty agent Mr.\nMeiklewham, before any thing like decent preparation could be made for\nthe ensuing entertainment; and they were left to their unassisted\nendeavours by Clara, who, during both the Tuesday and Wednesday,\nobstinately kept herself secluded; nor could her brother, either by\nthreats or flattery, extort from her any light concerning her purpose on\nthe approaching and important Thursday. To do John Mowbray justice, he\nloved his sister as much as he was capable of loving any thing but\nhimself; and when, in several arguments, he had the mortification to\nfind that she was not to be prevailed on to afford her assistance, he,\nwithout complaint, quietly set himself to do the best he could by his\nown unassisted judgment or opinion with regard to the necessary\npreparations.\n\nThis was not, at present, so easy a task as might be supposed: for\nMowbray was ambitious of that character of _ton_ and elegance, which\nmasculine faculties alone are seldom capable of attaining on such\nmomentous occasions. The more solid materials of a collation were indeed\nto be obtained for money from the next market-town, and were purchased\naccordingly; but he felt it was likely to present the vulgar plenty of a\nfarmer's feast, instead of the elegant entertainment, which might be\nannounced in a corner of the county paper, as given by John Mowbray,\nEsq. of St. Ronan's, to the gay and fashionable company assembled at\nthat celebrated spring. There was likely to be all sorts of error and\nirregularity in dishing, and in sending up; for Shaws-Castle boasted\nneither an accomplished housekeeper, nor a kitchenmaid with a hundred\npair of hands to execute her mandates. All the domestic arrangements\nwere on the minutest system of economy consistent with ordinary decency,\nexcept in the stables, which were excellent and well kept. But can a\ngroom of the stables perform the labours of a groom of the chambers? or\ncan the gamekeeper arrange in tempting order the carcasses of the birds\nhe has shot, strew them with flowers, and garnish them with piquant\nsauces? It would be as reasonable to expect a gallant soldier to act as\nundertaker, and conduct the funeral of the enemy he has slain.\n\nIn a word, Mowbray talked, and consulted, and advised, and squabbled,\nwith the deaf cook, and a little old man whom he called the butler,\nuntil he at length perceived so little chance of bringing order out of\nconfusion, or making the least advantageous impression on such obdurate\nunderstandings as he had to deal with, that he fairly committed the\nwhole matter of the collation, with two or three hearty curses, to the\ncharge of the officials principally concerned, and proceeded to take the\nstate of the furniture and apartments under his consideration.\n\nHere he found himself almost equally helpless; for what male wit is\nadequate to the thousand little coquetries practised in such\narrangements? how can masculine eyes judge of the degree of _demi-jour_\nwhich is to be admitted into a decorated apartment, or discriminate\nwhere the broad light should be suffered to fall on a tolerable picture,\nwhere it should be excluded, lest the stiff daub of a periwigged\ngrandsire should become too rigidly prominent? And if men are unfit for\nweaving such a fairy web of light and darkness as may best suit\nfurniture, ornaments, and complexions, how shall they be adequate to the\nyet more mysterious office of arranging, while they disarrange, the\nvarious movables in the apartment? so that while all has the air of\nnegligence and chance, the seats are placed as if they had been\ntransported by a wish to the spot most suitable for accommodation;\nstiffness and confusion are at once avoided, the company are neither\nlimited to a formal circle of chairs, nor exposed to break their noses\nover wandering stools; but the arrangements seem to correspond to what\nought to be the tone of the conversation, easy, without being confused,\nand regulated, without being constrained or stiffened.\n\nThen how can a clumsy male wit attempt the arrangement of all the\n_chiffonerie_, by which old snuff-boxes, heads of canes, pomander boxes,\nlamer beads, and all the trash usually found in the pigeon-holes of the\nbureaus of old-fashioned ladies, may be now brought into play, by\nthrowing them, carelessly grouped with other unconsidered trifles, such\nas are to be seen in the windows of a pawnbroker's shop, upon a marble\n_encognure_, or a mosaic work-table, thereby turning to advantage the\ntrash and trinketry, which all the old maids or magpies, who have\ninhabited the mansion for a century, have contrived to accumulate. With\nwhat admiration of the ingenuity of the fair artist have I sometimes\npried into these miscellaneous groups of _pseudo-bijouterie_, and seen\nthe great grandsire's thumb-ring couchant with the coral and bells of\nthe first-born--and the boatswain's whistle of some old naval uncle, or\nhis silver tobacco-box, redolent of Oroonoko, happily grouped with the\nmother's ivory comb-case, still odorous of musk, and with some virgin\naunt's tortoise-shell spectacle-case, and the eagle's talon of ebony,\nwith which, in the days of long and stiff stays, our grandmothers were\nwont to alleviate any little irritation in their back or shoulders! Then\nthere was the silver strainer, on which, in more economical times than\nours, the lady of the house placed the tea-leaves, after the very last\ndrop had been exhausted, that they might afterwards be hospitably\ndivided among the company, to be eaten with sugar, and with bread and\nbutter. Blessings upon a fashion which has rescued from the claws of\nabigails, and the melting-pot of the silversmith, those neglected\n_cimelia_, for the benefit of antiquaries and the decoration of\nside-tables! But who shall presume to place them there, unless under the\ndirection of female taste? and of that Mr. Mowbray, though possessed of\na large stock of such treasures, was for the present entirely deprived.\n\nThis digression upon his difficulties is already too long, or I might\nmention the Laird's inexperience in the art of making the worse appear\nthe better garnishment, of hiding a darned carpet with a new\nfloor-cloth, and flinging an Indian shawl over a faded and threadbare\nsofa. But I have said enough, and more than enough, to explain his\ndilemma to an unassisted bachelor, who, without mother, sister, or\ncousin, without skilful housekeeper, or experienced clerk of the\nkitchen, or valet of parts and figure, adventures to give an\nentertainment, and aspires to make it elegant and _comme il faut_.\n\nThe sense of his insufficiency was the more vexatious to Mowbray, as he\nwas aware he would find sharp critics in the ladies, and particularly in\nhis constant rival, Lady Penelope Penfeather. He was, therefore,\nincessant in his exertions; and for two whole days ordered and\ndisordered, demanded, commanded, countermanded, and reprimanded, without\npause or cessation. The companion, for he could not be termed an\nassistant, of his labours, was his trusty agent, who trotted from room\nto room after him, affording him exactly the same degree of sympathy\nwhich a dog doth to his master when distressed in mind, by looking in\nhis face from time to time with a piteous gaze, as if to assure him that\nhe partakes of his trouble, though he neither comprehends the cause or\nthe extent of it, nor has in the slightest degree the power to remove\nit.\n\nAt length when Mowbray had got some matters arranged to his mind, and\nabandoned a great many which he would willingly have put in better\norder, he sat down to dinner upon the Wednesday preceding the appointed\nday, with his worthy aide-de-camp, Mr. Meiklewham; and after bestowing a\nfew muttered curses upon the whole concern, and the fantastic old maid\nwho had brought him into the scrape, by begging an invitation, declared\nthat all things might now go to the devil their own way, for so sure as\nhis name was John Mowbray, he would trouble himself no more about them.\n\nKeeping this doughty resolution, he sat down to dinner with his counsel\nlearned in the law; and speedily they dispatched the dish of chops which\nwas set before them, and the better part of the bottle of old port,\nwhich served for its menstruum.\n\n\"We are well enough now,\" said Mowbray, \"though we have had none of\ntheir d----d kickshaws.\"\n\n\"A wamefou' is a wamefou',\" said the writer, swabbing his greasy chops,\n\"whether it be of the barleymeal or the bran.\"\n\n\"A cart-horse thinks so,\" said Mowbray; \"but we must do as others do,\nand gentlemen and ladies are of a different opinion.\"\n\n\"The waur for themselves and the country baith, St. Ronan's--it's the\njinketing and the jirbling wi' tea and wi' trumpery that brings our\nnobles to nine-pence, and mony a het ha'-house to a hired lodging in the\nAbbey.\"\n\nThe young gentleman paused for a few minutes--filled a bumper, and\npushed the bottle to the senior--then said abruptly, \"Do you believe in\nluck, Mick?\"\n\n\"In luck?\" answered the attorney; \"what do you mean by the question?\"\n\n\"Why, because I believe in luck myself--in a good or bad run of luck at\ncards.\"\n\n\"You wad have mair luck the day, if you had never touched them,\" replied\nhis confident.\n\n\"That is not the question now,\" said Mowbray; \"but what I wonder at is\nthe wretched chance that has attended us miserable Lairds of St. Ronan's\nfor more than a hundred years, that we have always been getting worse in\nthe world, and never better. Never has there been such a backsliding\ngeneration, as the parson would say--half the country once belonged to\nmy ancestors, and now the last furrows of it seem to be flying.\"\n\n\"Fleeing!\" said the writer, \"they are barking and fleeing baith.--This\nShaws-Castle here, I'se warrant it flee up the chimney after the rest,\nwere it not weel fastened down with your grandfather's tailzie.\"\n\n\"Damn the tailzie!\" said Mowbray; \"if they had meant to keep up their\nestate, they should have entailed it when it was worth keeping: to tie a\nman down to such an insignificant thing as St. Ronan's, is like\ntethering a horse on six roods of a Highland moor.\"\n\n\"Ye have broke weel in on the mailing by your feus down at the Well,\"\nsaid Meiklewham, \"and raxed ower the tether maybe a wee bit farther than\nye had ony right to do.\"\n\n\"It was by your advice, was it not?\" said the Laird.\n\n\"I'se ne'er deny it, St. Ronan's,\" answered the writer; \"but I am such a\ngude-natured guse, that I just set about pleasing you as an auld wife\npleases a bairn.\"\n\n\"Ay,\" said the man of pleasure, \"when she reaches it a knife to cut its\nown fingers with.--These acres would have been safe enough, if it had\nnot been for your d----d advice.\"\n\n\"And yet you were grumbling e'en now,\" said the man of business, \"that\nyou have not the power to gar the whole estate flee like a wild-duck\nacross a bog? Troth, you need care little about it; for if you have\nincurred an irritancy--and sae thinks Mr. Wisebehind, the advocate, upon\nan A. B. memorial that I laid before him--your sister, or your sister's\ngoodman, if she should take the fancy to marry, might bring a\ndeclarator, and evict St. Ronan's frae ye in the course of twa or three\nsessions.\"\n\n\"My sister will never marry,\" said John Mowbray.\n\n\"That's easily said,\" replied the writer; \"but as broken a ship's come\nto land. If ony body kend o' the chance she has o' the estate, there's\nmony a weel-doing man would think little of the bee in her bonnet.\"\n\n\"Harkye, Mr. Meiklewham,\" said the Laird, \"I will be obliged to you if\nyou will speak of Miss Mowbray with the respect due to her father's\ndaughter, and my sister.\"\n\n\"Nae offence, St. Ronan's, nae offence,\" answered the man of law; \"but\nilka man maun speak sae as to be understood,--that is, when he speaks\nabout business. Ye ken yoursell, that Miss Clara is no just like other\nfolk; and were I you--it's my duty to speak plain--I wad e'en gie in a\nbit scroll of a petition to the Lords, to be appointed Curator Bonis, in\nrespect of her incapacity to manage her own affairs.\"\n\n\"Meiklewham,\" said Mowbray, \"you are a\"----and then stopped short.\n\n\"What am I, Mr. Mowbray?\" said Meiklewham, somewhat sternly--\"What am I?\nI wad be glad to ken what I am.\"\n\n\"A very good lawyer, I dare say,\" replied St. Ronan's, who was too much\nin the power of his agent to give way to his first impulse. \"But I must\ntell you, that rather than take such a measure against poor Clara, as\nyou recommend, I would give her up the estate, and become an ostler or a\npostilion for the rest of my life.\"\n\n\"Ah, St. Ronan's,\" said the man of law, \"if you had wished to keep up\nthe auld house, you should have taken another trade, than to become an\nostler or a postilion. What ailed you, man, but to have been a lawyer as\nweel as other folk? My auld Maister had a wee bit Latin about _rerum\ndominos gentemque togatam_, whilk signified, he said, that all lairds\nshould be lawyers.\"\n\n\"All lawyers are likely to become lairds, I think,\" replied Mowbray;\n\"they purchase our acres by the thousand, and pay us, according to the\nold story, with a multiplepoinding, as your learned friends call it, Mr.\nMeiklewham.\"\n\n\"Weel--and mightna you have purchased as weel as other folk?\"\n\n\"Not I,\" replied the Laird; \"I have no turn for that service, I should\nonly have wasted bombazine on my shoulders, and flour upon my\nthree-tailed wig--should but have lounged away my mornings in the\nOuter-House, and my evenings at the play-house, and acquired no more law\nthan what would have made me a wise justice at a Small-debt Court.\"\n\n\"If you gained little, you would have lost as little,\" said Meiklewham;\n\"and albeit ye were nae great gun at the bar, ye might aye have gotten a\nSheriffdom, or a Commissaryship, amang the lave, to keep the banes\ngreen; and sae ye might have saved your estate from deteriorating, if ye\ndidna mend it muckle.\"\n\n\"Yes, but I could not have had the chance of doubling it, as I might\nhave done,\" answered Mowbray, \"had that inconstant jade, Fortune, but\nstood a moment faithful to me. I tell you, Mick, that I have been,\nwithin this twelvemonth, worth a hundred thousand--worth fifty\nthousand--worth nothing, but the remnant of this wretched estate, which\nis too little to do one good while it is mine, though, were it sold, I\ncould start again, and mend my hand a little.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, just fling the helve after the hatchet,\" said his legal\nadviser--\"that's a' you think of. What signifies winning a hundred\nthousand pounds, if you win them to lose them a' again?\"\n\n\"What signifies it?\" replied Mowbray. \"Why, it signifies as much to a\nman of spirit, as having won a battle signifies to a general--no matter\nthat he is beaten afterwards in his turn, he knows there is luck for him\nas well as others, and so he has spirit to try it again. Here is the\nyoung Earl of Etherington will be amongst us in a day or two--they say\nhe is up to every thing--if I had but five hundred to begin with, I\nshould be soon up to him.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mowbray,\" said Meiklewham, \"I am sorry for ye. I have been your\nhouse's man-of-business--I may say, in some measure, your house's\nservant--and now I am to see an end of it all, and just by the lad that\nI thought maist likely to set it up again better than ever; for, to do\nye justice, you have aye had an ee to your ain interest, sae far as your\nlights gaed. It brings tears into my auld een.\"\n\n\"Never weep for the matter, Mick,\" answered Mowbray; \"some of it will\nstick, my old boy, in your pockets, if not in mine--your service will\nnot be altogether gratuitous, my old friend--the labourer is worthy of\nhis hire.\"\n\n\"Weel I wot is he,\" said the writer; \"but double fees would hardly carry\nfolk through some wark. But if ye will have siller, ye maun have\nsiller--but, I warrant, it goes just where the rest gaed.\"\n\n\"No, by twenty devils!\" exclaimed Mowbray, \"to fail this time is\nimpossible--Jack Wolverine was too strong for Etherington at any thing\nhe could name; and I can beat Wolverine from the Land's-End to Johnnie\nGroat's--but there must be something to go upon--the blunt must be had,\nMick.\"\n\n\"Very likely--nae doubt--that is always provided it _can_ be had,\"\nanswered the legal adviser.\n\n\"That's your business, my old cock,\" said Mowbray. \"This youngster will\nbe here perhaps to-morrow, with money in both pockets--he takes up his\nrents as he comes down, Mick--think of that, my old friend.\"\n\n\"Weel for them that have rents to take up,\" said Meiklewham; \"ours are\nlying rather ower low to be lifted at present.--But are you sure this\nEarl is a man to mell with?--are you sure ye can win of him, and that if\nyou do, he can pay his losings, Mr. Mowbray?--because I have kend mony\nare come for wool, and gang hame shorn; and though ye are a clever young\ngentleman, and I am bound to suppose ye ken as much about life as most\nfolk, and all that; yet some gate or other ye have aye come off at the\nlosing hand, as ye have ower much reason to ken this day--howbeit\"----\n\n\"O, the devil take your gossip, my dear Mick! If you can give no help,\nspare drowning me with your pother.--Why, man, I was a fresh hand--had\nmy apprentice-fees to pay--and these are no trifles, Mick.--But what of\nthat?--I am free of the company now, and can trade on my own bottom.\"\n\n\"Aweel, aweel, I wish it may be sae,\" said Meiklewham.\n\n\"It will be so, and it shall be so, my trusty friend,\" replied Mowbray,\ncheerily, \"so you will but help me to the stock to trade with.\"\n\n\"The stock?--what d'ye ca' the stock? I ken nae stock that ye have\nleft.\"\n\n\"But _you_ have plenty, my old boy--Come, sell out a few of your three\nper cents; I will pay difference--interest--exchange--every thing.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay--every thing or naething,\" answered Meiklewham; \"but as you are\nsae very pressing, I hae been thinking--Whan is the siller wanted?\"\n\n\"This instant--this day--to-morrow at farthest!\" exclaimed the proposed\nborrower.\n\n\"Wh--ew!\" whistled the lawyer, with a long prolongation of the note;\n\"the thing is impossible.\"\n\n\"It must be, Mick, for all that,\" answered Mr. Mowbray, who knew by\nexperience that _impossible_, when uttered by his accommodating friend\nin this tone, meant only, when interpreted, extremely difficult, and\nvery expensive.\n\n\"Then it must be by Miss Clara selling her stock, now that ye speak of\nstock,\" said Meiklewham; \"I wonder ye didna think of this before.\"\n\n\"I wish you had been dumb rather than that you had mentioned it now,\"\nsaid Mowbray, starting, as if stung by an adder--\"What, Clara's\npittance!--the trifle my aunt left her for her own fanciful\nexpenses--her own little private store, that she puts to so many good\npurposes--Poor Clara, that has so little!--And why not rather your own,\nMaster Meiklewham, who call yourself the friend and servant of our\nfamily?\"\n\n\"Ay, St. Ronan's,\" answered Meiklewham, \"that is a' very true--but\nservice is nae inheritance; and as for friendship, it begins at hame, as\nwise folk have said lang before our time. And for that matter, I think\nthey that are nearest sib should take maist risk. You are nearer and\ndearer to your sister, St. Ronan's, than you are to poor Saunders\nMeiklewham, that hasna sae muckle gentle blood as would supper up an\nhungry flea.\"\n\n\"I will not do this,\" said St. Ronan's, walking up and down with much\nagitation; for, selfish as he was, he loved his sister, and loved her\nthe more on account of those peculiarities which rendered his protection\nindispensable to her comfortable existence--\"I will not,\" he said,\n\"pillage her, come on't what will. I will rather go a volunteer to the\ncontinent, and die like a gentleman.\"\n\nHe continued to pace the room in a moody silence, which began to disturb\nhis companion, who had not been hitherto accustomed to see his patron\ntake matters so deeply. At length he made an attempt to attract the\nattention of the silent and sullen ponderer.\n\n\"Mr. Mowbray\"--no answer--\"I was saying, St. Ronan's\"--still no reply.\n\"I have been thinking about this matter--and\"----\n\n\"And _what_, sir?\" said St. Ronan's, stopping short, and speaking in a\nstern tone of voice.\n\n\"And, to speak truth, I see little feasibility in the matter ony way;\nfor if ye had the siller in your pocket to-day, it would be a' in the\nEarl of Etherington's the morn.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! you are a fool,\" answered Mowbray.\n\n\"That is not unlikely,\" said Meiklewham; \"but so is Sir Bingo Binks, and\nyet he's had the better of you, St. Ronan's, this twa or three times.\"\n\n\"It is false!--he has not,\" answered St. Ronan's, fiercely.\n\n\"Weel I wot,\" resumed Meiklewham, \"he took you in about the saumon fish,\nand some other wager ye lost to him this very day.\"\n\n\"I tell you once more, Meiklewham, you are a fool, and no more up to my\ntrim than you are to the longitude.--Bingo is got shy--I must give him\na little line, that is all--then I shall strike him to purpose--I am as\nsure of him as I am of the other--I know the fly they will both rise\nto--this cursed want of five hundred will do me out of ten thousand!\"\n\n\"If you are so certain of being the bangster--so very certain, I mean,\nof sweeping stakes,--what harm will Miss Clara come to by your having\nthe use of her siller? You can make it up to her for the risk ten times\ntold.\"\n\n\"And so I can, by Heaven!\" said St. Ronan's. \"Mick, you are right, and I\nam a scrupulous, chicken-hearted fool. Clara shall have a thousand for\nher poor five hundred--she shall, by ----. And I will carry her to\nEdinburgh for a season, or perhaps to London, and we will have the best\nadvice for her case, and the best company to divert her. And if they\nthink her a little odd--why, d---- me, I am her brother, and will bear\nher through it. Yes--yes--you're right; there can be no hurt in\nborrowing five hundred of her for a few days, when such profit may be\nmade on't, both for her and me.--Here, fill the glasses, my old boy, and\ndrink success to it, for you are right.\"\n\n\"Here is success to it, with all my heart,\" answered Meiklewham,\nheartily glad to see his patron's sanguine temper arrive at this\ndesirable conclusion, and yet willing to hedge in his own credit; \"but\nit is _you_ are right, and not _me_, for I advise nothing except on your\nassurances, that you can make your ain of this English earl, and of this\nSir Bingo--and if you can but do that, I am sure it would be unwise and\nunkind in ony ane of your friends to stand in your light.\"\n\n\"True, Mick, true,\" answered Mowbray.--\"And yet dice and cards are but\nbones and pasteboard, and the best horse ever started may slip a\nshoulder before he get to the winning-post--and so I wish Clara's\nventure had not been in such a bottom.--But, hang it, care killed a\ncat--I can hedge as well as any one, if the odds turn up against me--so\nlet us have the cash, Mick.\"\n\n\"Aha! but there go two words to that bargain--the stock stands in my\nname, and Tam Turnpenny the banker's, as trustees for Miss Clara--Now,\nget you her letter to us, desiring us to sell out and to pay you the\nproceeds, and Tam Turnpenny will let you have five hundred pounds\n_instanter_, on the faith of the transaction; for I fancy you would\ndesire a' the stock to be sold out, and it will produce more than six\nhundred, or seven hundred pounds either--and I reckon you will be\nselling out the whole--it's needless making twa bites of a cherry.\"\n\n\"True,\" answered Mowbray; \"since we must be rogues, or something like\nit, let us make it worth our while at least; so give me a form of the\nletter, and Clara shall copy it--that is, if she consents; for you know\nshe can keep her own opinion as well as any other woman in the world.\"\n\n\"And that,\" said Meiklewham, \"is as the wind will keep its way, preach\nto it as ye like. But if I might advise about Miss Clara--I wad say\nnaething mair than that I was stressed for the penny money; for I\nmistake her muckle if she would like to see you ganging to pitch and\ntoss wi' this lord and tither baronet for her aunt's three per cents--I\nken she has some queer notions--she gies away the feck of the dividends\non that very stock in downright charity.\"\n\n\"And I am in hazard to rob the poor as well as my sister!\" said Mowbray,\nfilling once more his own glass and his friend's. \"Come, Mick, no\nsky-lights--here is Clara's health--she is an angel--and I am--what I\nwill not call myself, and suffer no other man to call me.--But I shall\nwin this time--I am sure I shall, since Clara's fortune depends upon\nit.\"\n\n\"Now, I think, on the other hand,\" said Meiklewham, \"that if any thing\nshould chance wrang, (and Heaven kens that the best-laid schemes will\ngang ajee,) it will be a great comfort to think that the ultimate losers\nwill only be the poor folk, that have the parish between them and\nabsolute starvation--if your sister spent her ain siller, it would be a\nvery different story.\"\n\n\"Hush, Mick--for God's sake, hush, mine honest friend,\" said Mowbray;\n\"it is quite true; thou art a rare counsellor in time of need, and hast\nas happy a manner of reconciling a man's conscience with his\nnecessities, as might set up a score of casuists; but beware, my most\nzealous counsellor and confessor, how you drive the nail too far--I\npromise you some of the chaffing you are at just now rather abates my\npluck.--Well--give me your scroll--I will to Clara with it--though I\nwould rather meet the best shot in Britain, with ten paces of green sod\nbetwixt us.\" So saying, he left the apartment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nFRATERNAL LOVE.\n\n    Nearest of blood should still be next in love;\n    And when I see these happy children playing,\n    While William gathers flowers for Ellen's ringlets,\n    And Ellen dresses flies for William's angle,\n    I scarce can think, that in advancing life,\n    Coldness, unkindness, interest, or suspicion,\n    Will e'er divide that unity so sacred,\n    Which Nature bound at birth.\n\n_Anonymous._\n\n\n\nWhen Mowbray had left his dangerous adviser, in order to steer the\ncourse which his agent had indicated, without offering to recommend it,\nhe went to the little parlour which his sister was wont to term her own,\nand in which she spent great part of her time. It was fitted up with a\nsort of fanciful neatness; and in its perfect arrangement and good\norder, formed a strong contrast to the other apartments of the old and\nneglected mansion-house. A number of little articles lay on the\nwork-table, indicating the elegant, and, at the same time, the unsettled\nturn of the inhabitant's mind. There were unfinished drawings, blotted\nmusic, needlework of various kinds, and many other little female tasks;\nall undertaken with zeal, and so far prosecuted with art and elegance,\nbut all flung aside before any one of them was completed.\n\nClara herself sat upon a little low couch by the window, reading, or at\nleast turning over the leaves of a book, in which she seemed to read.\nBut instantly starting up when she saw her brother, she ran towards him\nwith the most cordial cheerfulness.\n\n\"Welcome, welcome, my dear John; this is very kind of you to come to\nvisit your recluse sister. I have been trying to nail my eyes and my\nunderstanding to a stupid book here, because they say too much thought\nis not quite good for me. But, either the man's dulness, or my want of\nthe power of attending, makes my eyes pass over the page, just as one\nseems to read in a dream, without being able to comprehend one word of\nthe matter. You shall talk to me, and that will do better. What can I\ngive you to show that you are welcome? I am afraid tea is all I have to\noffer, and that you set too little store by.\"\n\n\"I shall be glad of a cup at present,\" said Mowbray, \"for I wish to\nspeak with you.\"\n\n\"Then Jessy shall make it ready instantly,\" said Miss Mowbray, ringing,\nand giving orders to her waiting-maid--\"but you must not be ungrateful,\nJohn, and plague me with any of the ceremonial for your\nf\u00c3\u00aate--'sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.' I will attend, and\nplay my part as prettily as you can desire; but to think of it\nbeforehand, would make both my head and my heart ache; and so I beg you\nwill spare me on the subject.\"\n\n\"Why, you wild kitten,\" said Mowbray, \"you turn every day more shy of\nhuman communication--we shall have you take the woods one day, and\nbecome as savage as the Princess Caraboo. But I will plague you about\nnothing if I can help it. If matters go not smooth on the great day,\nthey must e'en blame the dull thick head that had no fair lady to help\nhim in his need. But, Clara, I had something more material to say to\nyou--something indeed of the last importance.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" said Clara, in a tone of voice approaching to a\nscream--\"in the name of God, what is it? You know not how you terrify\nme!\"\n\n\"Nay, you start at a shadow, Clara,\" answered her brother. \"It is no\nsuch uncommon matter neither--good faith, it is the most common distress\nin the world, so far as I know the world--I am sorely pinched for\nmoney.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" replied Clara, in a tone which seemed to her brother as\nmuch to underrate the difficulty, when it was explained, as her fears\nhad exaggerated it before she heard its nature.\n\n\"Is that all? Indeed it is all, and comprehends a great deal of\nvexation. I shall be hard run unless I can get a certain sum of\nmoney--and I must e'en ask you if you can help me?\"\n\n\"Help you?\" replied Clara; \"Yes, with all my heart--but you know my\npurse is a light one--more than half of my last dividend is in it,\nhowever, and I am sure, John, I shall be happy if it can serve\nyou--especially as that will at least show that your wants are but small\nones.\"\n\n\"Alas, Clara, if you would help me,\" said her brother, half repentant of\nhis purpose, \"you must draw the neck of the goose which lays the golden\neggs--you must lend me the whole stock.\"\n\n\"And why not, John,\" said the simple-hearted girl, \"if it will do you a\nkindness? Are you not my natural guardian? Are you not a kind one? And\nis not my little fortune entirely at your disposal? You will, I am\nsure, do all for the best.\"\n\n\"I fear I may not,\" said Mowbray, starting from her, and more distressed\nby her sudden and unsuspicious compliance, than he would have been by\ndifficulties, or remonstrance. In the latter case, he would have stifled\nthe pangs of conscience amid the manoeuvres which he must have\nresorted to for obtaining her acquiescence; as matters stood, there was\nall the difference that there is between slaughtering a tame and\nunresisting animal, and pursuing wild game, until the animation of the\nsportsman's exertions overcomes the internal sense of his own\ncruelty.[I-E] The same idea occurred to Mowbray himself.\n\n\"By G--,\" he said, \"this is like shooting the bird sitting.--Clara,\" he\nadded, \"I fear this money will scarce be employed as you would wish.\"\n\n\"Employ it as you yourself please, my dearest brother,\" she replied,\n\"and I will believe it is all for the best.\"\n\n\"Nay, I am doing for the best,\" he replied; \"at least, I am doing what\nmust be done, for I see no other way through it--so all you have to do\nis to copy this paper, and bid adieu to bank dividends--for a little\nwhile at least. I trust soon to double this little matter for you, if\nFortune will but stand my friend.\"\n\n\"Do not trust to Fortune, John,\" said Clara, smiling, though with an\nexpression of deep melancholy. \"Alas! she has never been a friend to our\nfamily--not at least for many a day.\"\n\n\"She favours the bold, say my old grammatical exercises,\" answered her\nbrother; \"and I must trust her, were she as changeable as a\nweathercock.--And yet--if she should jilt me!--What will you do--what\nwill you say, Clara, if I am unable, contrary to my hope, trust, and\nexpectation, to repay you this money within a short time?\"\n\n\"Do?\" replied Clara; \"I must do without it, you know; and for saying, I\nwill not say a word.\"\n\n\"True,\" replied Mowbray, \"but your little expenses--your charities--your\nhalt and blind--your round of paupers?\"\n\n\"Well, I can manage all that too. Look you here, John, how many\nhalf-worked trifles there are. The needle or the pencil is the resource\nof all distressed heroines, you know; and I promise you, though I have\nbeen a little idle and unsettled of late, yet, when I do set about it,\nno Emmeline or Ethelinde of them all ever sent such loads of trumpery to\nmarket as I shall, or made such wealth as I will do. I dare say Lady\nPenelope, and all the gentry at the Well, will purchase, and will\nraffle, and do all sort of things to encourage the pensive performer. I\nwill send them such lots of landscapes with sap-green trees, and\nmazareen-blue rivers, and portraits that will terrify the originals\nthemselves--and handkerchiefs and turbans, with needlework scallopped\nexactly like the walks on the Belvidere--Why, I shall become a little\nfortune in the first season.\"\n\n\"No, Clara,\" said John, gravely, for a virtuous resolution had gained\nthe upperhand in his bosom, while his sister ran on in this manner,--\"We\nwill do something better than all this. If this kind help of yours does\nnot fetch me through, I am determined I will cut the whole concern. It\nis but standing a laugh or two, and hearing a gay fellow say, D---- me,\nJack, are you turned clodhopper at last?--that is the worst. Dogs,\nhorses, and all, shall go to the hammer; we will keep nothing but your\npony, and I will trust to a pair of excellent legs. There is enough left\nof the old acres to keep us in the way you like best, and that I will\nlearn to like. I will work in the garden, and work in the forest, mark\nmy own trees, and cut them myself, keep my own accounts, and send\nSaunders Meiklewham to the devil.\"\n\n\"That last is the best resolution of all, John,\" said Clara; \"and if\nsuch a day should come round, I should be the happiest of living\ncreatures--I should not have a grief left in the world--if I had, you\nshould never see or hear of it--it should lie here,\" she said, pressing\nher hand on her bosom, \"buried as deep as a funereal urn in a cold\nsepulchre. Oh! could we not begin such a life to-morrow? If it is\nabsolutely necessary that this trifle of money should be got rid of\nfirst, throw it into the river, and think you have lost it amongst\ngamblers and horse-jockeys.\"\n\nClara's eyes, which she fondly fixed on her brother's face, glowed\nthrough the tears which her enthusiasm called into them, while she thus\naddressed him. Mowbray, on his part, kept his looks fixed on the ground,\nwith a flush on his cheek, that expressed at once false pride and real\nshame.\n\nAt length he looked up:--\"My dear girl,\" he said, \"how foolishly you\ntalk, and how foolishly I, that have twenty things to do, stand here\nlistening to you! All will go smooth on _my_ plan--if it should not, we\nhave yours in reserve, and I swear to you I will adopt it. The trifle\nwhich this letter of yours enables me to command, may have luck in it,\nand we must not throw up the cards while we have a chance of the\ngame.--Were I to cut from this moment, these few hundreds would make us\nlittle better or little worse--so you see we have two strings to our\nbow. Luck is sometimes against me, that is true--but upon true\nprinciple, and playing on the square, I can manage the best of them, or\nmy name is not Mowbray. Adieu, my dearest Clara.\" So saying, he kissed\nher cheek with a more than usual degree of affection.\n\nEre he could raise himself from his stooping posture, she threw her arm\nkindly over his neck, and said with a tone of the deepest interest, \"My\ndearest brother, your slightest wish has been, and ever shall be, a law\nto me--Oh! if you would but grant me one request in return!\"\n\n\"What is it, you silly girl?\" said Mowbray, gently disengaging himself\nfrom her hold.--\"What is it you can have to ask that needs such a solemn\npreface?--Remember, I hate prefaces; and when I happen to open a book,\nalways skip them.\"\n\n\"Without preface, then, my dearest brother, will you, for my sake, avoid\nthose quarrels in which the people yonder are eternally engaged? I never\ngo down there but I hear of some new brawl; and I never lay my head down\nto sleep, but I dream that you are the victim of it. Even last\nnight\"----\n\n\"Nay, Clara, if you begin to tell your dreams, we shall never have done.\nSleeping, to be sure, is the most serious employment of your life--for\nas to eating, you hardly match a sparrow; but I entreat you to sleep\nwithout dreaming, or to keep your visions to yourself.--Why do you keep\nsuch fast hold of me?--What on earth can you be afraid of?--Surely you\ndo not think the blockhead Binks, or any other of the good folks below\nyonder, dared to turn on me? Egad, I wish they would pluck up a little\nmettle, that I might have an excuse for drilling them. Gad, I would soon\nteach them to follow at heel.\"\n\n\"No, John,\" replied his sister; \"it is not of such men as these that I\nhave any fear--and yet, cowards are sometimes driven to desperation, and\nbecome more dangerous than better men--but it is not such as these that\nI fear. But there are men in the world whose qualities are beyond their\nseeming--whose spirit and courage lie hidden, like metals in the mine,\nunder an unmarked or a plain exterior.--You may meet with such--you are\nrash and headlong, and apt to exercise your wit without always weighing\nconsequences, and thus\"----\n\n\"On my word, Clara,\" answered Mowbray, \"you are in a most sermonizing\nhumour this morning! the parson himself could not have been more logical\nor profound. You have only to divide your discourse into heads, and\ngarnish it with conclusions for use, and conclusions for doctrine, and\nit might be preached before a whole presbytery, with every chance of\ninstruction and edification. But I am a man of the world, my little\nClara; and though I wish to go in death's way as little as possible, I\nmust not fear the raw-head and bloody-bones neither.--And who the devil\nis to put the question to me?--I must know that, Clara, for you have\nsome especial person in your eye when you bid me take care of\nquarrelling.\"\n\nClara could not become paler than was her usual complexion; but her\nvoice faltered as she eagerly assured her brother, that she had no\nparticular person in her thoughts.\n\n\"Clara,\" said her brother, \"do you remember, when there was a report of\na bogle[I-17] in the upper orchard, when we were both children?--Do you\nremember how you were perpetually telling me to take care of the bogle,\nand keep away from its haunts?--And do you remember my going on purpose\nto detect the bogle, finding the cow-boy, with a shirt about him, busied\nin pulling pears, and treating him to a handsome drubbing?--I am the\nsame Jack Mowbray still, as ready to face danger, and unmask imposition;\nand your fears, Clara, will only make me watch more closely, till I find\nout the real object of them. If you warn me of quarrelling with some\none, it must be because you know some one who is not unlikely to quarrel\nwith me. You are a flighty and fanciful girl, but you have sense enough\nnot to trouble either yourself or me on a point of honour, save when\nthere is some good reason for it.\"\n\nClara once more protested, and it was with the deepest anxiety to be\nbelieved, that what she had said arose only out of the general\nconsequences which she apprehended from the line of conduct her brother\nhad adopted, and which, in her apprehension, was so likely to engage him\nin the broils that divided the good company at the Spring. Mowbray\nlistened to her explanation with an air of doubt, or rather incredulity,\nsipped a cup of tea which had for some time been placed before him, and\nat length replied, \"Well, Clara, whether I am right or wrong in my\nguess, it would be cruel to torment you any more, remembering what you\nhave just done for me. But do justice to your brother, and believe, that\nwhen you have any thing to ask of him, an explicit declaration of your\nwishes will answer your purpose much better than any ingenious oblique\nattempts to influence me. Give up all thoughts of such, my dear\nClara--you are but a poor manoeuvrer, but were you the very Machiavel\nof your sex, you should not turn the flank of John Mowbray.\"\n\nHe left the room as he spoke, and did not return, though his sister\ntwice called upon him. It is true that she uttered the word brother so\nfaintly, that perhaps the sound did not reach his ears.--\"He is gone,\"\nshe said, \"and I have had no power to speak out! I am like the wretched\ncreatures, who, it is said, lie under a potent charm, that prevents them\nalike from shedding tears and from confessing their crimes--Yes, there\nis a spell on this unhappy heart, and either that must be dissolved, or\nthis must break.\"\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[I-17] Bogle--in English, Goblin.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nTHE CHALLENGE.\n\n    A slight note I have about me, for the delivery of which you must\n    excuse me. It is an office which friendship calls upon me to do, and\n    no way offensive to you, as I desire nothing but right on both\n    sides.\n\n_King and No King._\n\n\nThe intelligent reader may recollect, that Tyrrel departed from the Fox\nHotel on terms not altogether so friendly towards the company as those\nunder which he entered it. Indeed, it occurred to him, that he might\nprobably have heard something farther on the subject, though, amidst\nmatters of deeper and more anxious consideration, the idea only passed\nhastily through his mind; and two days having gone over without any\nmessage from Sir Bingo Binks, the whole affair glided entirely out of\nhis memory.\n\nThe truth was, that although never old woman took more trouble to\ncollect and blow up with her bellows the embers of her decayed fire,\nthan Captain MacTurk kindly underwent for the purpose of puffing into a\nflame the dying sparkles of the Baronet's courage; yet two days were\nspent in fruitless conferences before he could attain the desired point.\nHe found Sir Bingo on these different occasions in all sorts of\ndifferent moods of mind, and disposed to view the thing in all shades of\nlight, except what the Captain thought was the true one.--He was in a\ndrunken humour--in a sullen humour--in a thoughtless and vilipending\nhumour--in every humour but a fighting one. And when Captain MacTurk\ntalked of the reputation of the company at the Well, Sir Bingo pretended\nto take offence, said the company might go to the devil, and hinted that\nhe \"did them sufficient honour by gracing them with his countenance, but\ndid not mean to constitute them any judges of his affairs. The fellow\nwas a raff, and he would have nothing to do with him.\"\n\nCaptain MacTurk would willingly have taken measures against the Baronet\nhimself, as in a state of contumacy, but was opposed by Winterblossom\nand other members of the committee, who considered Sir Bingo as too\nimportant and illustrious a member of their society to be rashly\nexpelled from a place not honoured by the residence of many persons of\nrank; and finally insisted that nothing should be done in the matter\nwithout the advice of Mowbray, whose preparations for his solemn\nfestival on the following Thursday had so much occupied him, that he had\nnot lately appeared at the Well.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the gallant Captain seemed to experience as much\ndistress of mind, as if some stain had lain on his own most unblemished\nof reputations. He went up and down upon the points of his toes, rising\nup on his instep with a jerk which at once expressed vexation and\ndefiance--He carried his nose turned up in the air, like that of a pig\nwhen he snuffs the approaching storm--He spoke in monosyllables when he\nspoke at all; and--what perhaps illustrated in the strongest manner the\ndepth of his feelings--he refused, in face of the whole company, to\npledge Sir Bingo in a glass of the Baronet's peculiar cogniac.\n\nAt length, the whole Well was alarmed by the report brought by a smart\noutrider, that the young Earl of Etherington, reported to be rising on\nthe horizon of fashion as a star of the first magnitude, intended to\npass an hour, or a day, or a week, as it might happen, (for his lordship\ncould not be supposed to know his own mind,) at St. Ronan's Well.\n\nThis suddenly put all in motion. Almanacks were opened to ascertain his\nlordship's age, enquiries were made concerning the extent of his\nfortune, his habits were quoted, his tastes were guessed at; and all\nthat the ingenuity of the Managing Committee could devise was resorted\nto, in order to recommend their Spa to this favourite of fortune. An\nexpress was dispatched to Shaws-Castle with the agreeable intelligence,\nwhich fired the train of hope that led to Mowbray's appropriation of his\nsister's capital. He did not, however, think proper to obey the summons\nto the Spring; for, not being aware in what light the Earl might regard\nthe worthies there assembled, he did not desire to be found by his\nlordship in any strict connexion with them.\n\nSir Bingo Binks was in a different situation. The bravery with which he\nhad endured the censure of the place began to give way, when he\nconsidered that a person of such distinction as that which public\nopinion attached to Lord Etherington, should find him bodily indeed at\nSt. Ronan's, but, so far as society was concerned, on the road towards\nthe ancient city of Coventry; and his banishment thither, incurred by\nthat most unpardonable offence in modern morality, a solecism in the\ncode of honour. Though sluggish and inert when called to action, the\nBaronet was by no means an absolute coward; or, if so, he was of that\nclass which fights when reduced to extremity. He manfully sent for\nCaptain MacTurk, who waited upon him with a grave solemnity of aspect,\nwhich instantly was exchanged for a radiant joy, when Sir Bingo, in a\nfew words, empowered him to carry a message to that d----d strolling\nartist, by whom he had been insulted three days since.\n\n\"By Cot,\" said the Captain, \"my exceedingly goot and excellent friend,\nand I am happy to do such a favour for you! And it's well you have\nthought of it yourself; because, if it had not been for some of our very\ngoot and excellent friends, that would be putting their spoon into other\nfolk's dish, I should have been asking you a civil question myself, how\nyou came to dine with us, with all that mud and mire which Mr. Tyrrel's\ngrasp has left upon the collar of your coat--you understand me.--But it\nis much better as it is, and I will go to the man with all the speed of\nlight; and though, to be sure, it should have been sooner thought of,\nyet let me alone to make an excuse for that, just in my own civil\nway--better late thrive than never do well, you know, Sir Bingo; and if\nyou have made him wait a little while for his morning, you must give him\nthe better measure, my darling.\"\n\nSo saying, he awaited no reply, lest peradventure the commission with\nwhich he was so hastily and unexpectedly charged, should have been\nclogged with some condition of compromise. No such proposal, however,\nwas made on the part of the doughty Sir Bingo, who eyed his friend as he\nhastily snatched up his rattan to depart, with a dogged look of\nobstinacy, expressive, to use his own phrase, of a determined resolution\nto come up to the scratch; and when he heard the Captain's parting\nfootsteps, and saw the door shut behind him, he valiantly whistled a few\nbars of Jenny Sutton, in token he cared not a farthing how the matter\nwas to end.\n\nWith a swifter pace than his half-pay leisure usually encouraged, or\nthan his habitual dignity permitted, Captain MacTurk cleared the ground\nbetwixt the Spring and its gay vicinity, and the ruins of the Aultoun,\nwhere reigned our friend Meg Dods, the sole assertor of its ancient\ndignities. To the door of the Cleikum Inn the Captain addressed himself,\nas one too much accustomed to war to fear a rough reception; although at\nthe very first aspect of Meg, who presented her person at the half\nopened door, his military experience taught him that his entrance into\nthe place would, in all probability, be disputed.\n\n\"Is Mr. Tyrrel at home?\" was the question; and the answer was conveyed,\nby the counter-interrogation, \"Wha may ye be that speers?\"\n\nAs the most polite reply to this question, and an indulgence, at the\nsame time, of his own taciturn disposition, the Captain presented to\nLuckie Dods the fifth part of an ordinary playing card, much grimed with\nsnuff, which bore on its blank side his name and quality. But Luckie\nDods rejected the information thus tendered, with contemptuous scorn.\n\n\"Nane of your deil's play-books for me,\" said she; \"it's an ill world\nsince sic prick-my-dainty doings came in fashion--It's a poor tongue\nthat canna tell its ain name, and I'll hae nane of your scarts upon\npasteboard.\"\n\n\"I am Captain MacTurk, of the ---- regiment,\" said the Captain,\ndisdaining further answer.\n\n\"MacTurk?\" repeated Meg, with an emphasis, which induced the owner of\nthe name to reply, \"Yes, honest woman--MacTurk--Hector MacTurk--have you\nany objections to my name, goodwife?\"\n\n\"Nae objections have I,\" answered Meg; \"it's e'en an excellent name for\na heathen.--But, Captain MacTurk, since sae it be that ye are a captain,\nye may e'en face about and march your ways hame again, to the tune of\nDumbarton drums; for ye are ganging to have nae speech of Maister Tirl,\nor ony lodger of mine.\"\n\n\"And wherefore not?\" demanded the veteran; \"and is this of your own\nfoolish head, honest woman, or has your lodger left such orders?\"\n\n\"Maybe he has and maybe no,\" answered Meg, sturdily; \"and I ken nae mair\nright that ye suld ca' me honest woman, than I have to ca' you honest\nman, whilk is as far frae my thoughts as it wad be from heaven's truth.\"\n\n\"The woman is deleerit!\" said Captain MacTurk; \"but coom, coom--a\ngentleman is not to be misused in this way when he comes on a\ngentleman's business; so make you a bit room on the door-stane, that I\nmay pass by you, or I will make room for myself, by Cot! to your small\npleasure.\"\n\nAnd so saying he assumed the air of a man who was about to make good his\npassage. But Meg, without deigning farther reply, flourished around her\nhead the hearth-broom, which she had been employing to its more\nlegitimate purpose, when disturbed in her housewifery by Captain\nMacTurk.\n\n\"I ken your errand weel eneugh, Captain--and I ken yoursell. Ye are ane\nof the folk that gang about yonder setting folk by the lugs, as callants\nset their collies to fight. But ye sall come to nae lodger o' mine, let\na-be Maister Tirl, wi' ony sic ungodly errand; for I am ane that will\nkeep God's peace and the King's within my dwelling.\"\n\nSo saying, and in explicit token of her peaceable intentions, she again\nflourished her broom.\n\nThe veteran instinctively threw himself under Saint George's guard, and\ndrew two paces back, exclaiming, \"That the woman was either mad, or as\ndrunk as whisky could make her;\" an alternative which afforded Meg so\nlittle satisfaction, that she fairly rushed on her retiring adversary,\nand began to use her weapon to fell purpose.\n\n\"Me drunk, ye scandalous blackguard!\" (a blow with the broom interposed\nas parenthesis,) \"me, that am fasting from all but sin and bohea!\"\n(another whack.)\n\nThe Captain, swearing, exclaiming, and parrying, caught the blows as\nthey fell, showing much dexterity in single-stick. The people began to\ngather; and how long his gallantry might have maintained itself against\nthe spirit of self-defence and revenge, must be left uncertain, for the\narrival of Tyrrel, returned from a short walk, put a period to the\ncontest.\n\nMeg, who had a great respect for her guest, began to feel ashamed of her\nown violence, and slunk into the house; observing, however, that she\ntrewed she had made her hearth-broom and the auld heathen's pow right\nweel acquainted. The tranquillity which ensued upon her departure, gave\nTyrrel an opportunity to ask the Captain, whom he at length recognised,\nthe meaning of this singular affray, and whether the visit was intended\nfor him; to which the veteran replied very discomposedly, that \"he\nshould have known that long enough ago, if he had had decent people to\nopen his door, and answer a civil question, instead of a flyting\nmadwoman, who was worse than an eagle,\" he said, \"or a mastiff-bitch, or\na she-bear, or any other female beast in the creation.\"\n\nHalf suspecting his errand, and desirous to avoid unnecessary notoriety,\nTyrrel, as he showed the Captain to the parlour, which he called his\nown, entreated him to excuse the rudeness of his landlady, and to pass\nfrom the topic to that which had procured him the honour of this visit.\n\n\"And you are right, my good Master Tyrrel,\" said the Captain, pulling\ndown the sleeves of his coat, adjusting his handkerchief and\nbreast-ruffle, and endeavouring to recover the composure of manner\nbecoming his mission, but still adverting indignantly to the usage he\nhad received--\"By Cot! if she had but been a man, if it were the King\nhimself--However, Mr. Tyrrel, I am come on a civil errand--and very\ncivilly I have been treated--the auld bitch should be set in the stocks,\nand be tamned!--My friend, Sir Bingo--By Cot! I shall never forget that\nwoman's insolence--if there be a constable or a cat-o'-nine-tails within\nten miles\"----\n\n\"I perceive, Captain,\" said Tyrrel, \"that you are too much disturbed at\nthis moment to enter upon the business which has brought you here--if\nyou will step into my bedroom, and make use of some cold water and a\ntowel, it will give you the time to compose yourself a little.\"\n\n\"I shall do no such thing, Mr. Tyrrel,\" answered the Captain,\nsnappishly; \"I do not want to be composed at all, and I do not want to\nstay in this house a minute longer than to do my errand to you on my\nfriend's behalf--And as for this tamned woman Dods\"----\n\n\"You will in that case forgive my interrupting you, Captain MacTurk, as\nI presume your errand to me can have no reference to this strange\nquarrel with my landlady, with which I have nothing to\"----\n\n\"And if I thought that it had, sir,\" said the Captain, interrupting\nTyrrel in his turn, \"you should have given me satisfaction before you\nwas a quarter of an hour older--Oh, I would give five pounds to the\npretty fellow that would say, Captain MacTurk, the woman did right!\"\n\n\"I certainly will not be that person you wish for, Captain,\" replied\nTyrrel, \"because I really do not know who was in the right or wrong; but\nI am certainly sorry that you should have met with ill usage, when your\npurpose was to visit me.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, if you are concerned,\" said the man of peace, snappishly,\n\"so am I, and there is an end of it.--And touching my errand to you--you\ncannot have forgotten that you treated my friend, Sir Bingo Binks, with\nsingular incivility?\"\n\n\"I recollect nothing of the kind, Captain,\" replied Tyrrel. \"I remember\nthat the gentleman, so called, took some uncivil liberties in laying\nfoolish bets concerning me, and that I treated him, from respect to the\nrest of the company, and the ladies in particular, with a great degree\nof moderation and forbearance.\"\n\n\"And you must have very fine ideas of forbearance,\" replied the Captain,\n\"when you took my good friend by the collar of the coat, and lifted him\nout of your way as if he had been a puppy dog! My good Mr. Tyrrel, I can\nassure you he does not think that you have forborne him at all, and he\nhas no purpose to forbear you; and I must either carry back a sufficient\napology, or you must meet in a quiet way, with a good friend on each\nside.--And this was the errand I came on, when this tamned woman, with\nthe hearth-broom, who is an enemy to all quiet and peaceable\nproceedings\"----\n\n\"We will forget Mrs. Dods for the present, if you please, Captain\nMacTurk,\" said Tyrrel--\"and, to speak to the present subject, you will\npermit me to say, that I think this summons comes a little of the\nlatest. You know best as a military man, but I have always understood\nthat such differences are usually settled immediately after they\noccur--not that I intend to baulk Sir Bingo's inclinations upon the\nscore of delay, or any other account.\"\n\n\"I dare say you will not--I dare say you will not, Mr. Tyrrel,\" answered\nthe Captain--\"I am free to think that you know better what belongs to a\ngentleman.--And as to time--look you, my good sir, there are different\nsorts of people in this world, as there are different sorts of\nfire-arms. There are your hair-trigger'd rifles, that go off just at the\nright moment, and in the twinkling of an eye, and that, Mr. Tyrrel, is\nyour true man of honour;--and there is a sort of person that takes a\nthing up too soon, and sometimes backs out of it, like your rubbishy\nBirmingham pieces, that will at one time go off at half-cock, and at\nanother time burn priming without going off at all;--then again pieces\nthat hang fire--or I should rather say, that are like the matchlocks\nwhich the black fellows use in the East Indies--there must be some\nblowing of the match, and so forth, which occasions delay, but the piece\ncarries true enough after all.\"\n\n\"And your friend Sir Bingo's valour is of this last kind, Captain--I\npresume that is the inference. I should have thought it more like a\nboy's cannon, which is fired by means of a train, and is but a pop-gun\nafter all.\"\n\n\"I cannot allow of such comparisons, sir,\" said the Captain; \"you will\nunderstand that I come here as Sir Bingo's friend, and a reflection on\nhim will be an affront to me.\"\n\n\"I disclaim all intended offence to you, Captain--I have no wish to\nextend the number of my adversaries, or to add to them the name of a\ngallant officer like yourself,\" replied Tyrrel.\n\n\"You are too obliging, sir,\" said the Captain, drawing himself up with\ndignity. \"By Cot! and that was said very handsomely!--Well, sir, and\nshall I not have the pleasure of carrying back any explanation from you\nto Sir Bingo?--I assure you it would give me pleasure to make this\nmatter handsomely up.\"\n\n\"To Sir Bingo, Captain MacTurk, I have no apology to offer--I think I\ntreated him more gently than his impertinence deserved.\"\n\n\"Och, Och!\" sighed the Captain, with a strong Highland intonation; \"then\nthere is no more to be said, but just to settle time and place; for\npistols I suppose must be the weapons.\"\n\n\"All these matters are quite the same to me,\" said Tyrrel; \"only, in\nrespect of time, I should wish it to be as speedy as possible.--What say\nyou to one, afternoon, this very day?--You may name the place.\"\n\n\"At one, afternoon,\" replied the Captain deliberately, \"Sir Bingo will\nattend you--the place may be the Buck-stane; for as the whole company go\nto the water-side to-day to eat a kettle of fish,[I-18] there will be no\nrisk of interruption.--And who shall I speak to, my good friend, on your\nside of the quarrel?\"\n\n\"Really, Captain,\" replied Tyrrel, \"that is a puzzling question--I have\nno friend here--I suppose you could hardly act for both?\"\n\n\"It would be totally, absolutely, and altogether out of the question, my\ngood friend,\" replied MacTurk. \"But if you will trust to me, I will\nbring up a friend on your part from the Well, who, though you have\nhardly seen him before, will settle matters for you as well as if you\nhad been intimate for twenty years--and I will bring up the Doctor too,\nif I can get him unloosed from the petticoat of that fat widow Blower,\nthat he has strung himself upon.\"\n\n\"I have no doubt you will do every thing with perfect accuracy, Captain.\nAt one o'clock, then, we meet at the Buck-stane--Stay, permit me to see\nyou to the door.\"\n\n\"By Cot! and it is not altogether so unnecessary,\" said the Captain;\n\"for the tamned woman with the besom might have some advantage in that\nlong dark passage, knowing the ground better than I do--tamn her, I will\nhave amends on her, if there be whipping-post, or ducking-stool, or a\npair of stocks in the parish!\" And so saying, the Captain trudged off,\nhis spirits ever and anon agitated by recollection of the causeless\naggression of Meg Dods, and again composed to a state of happy serenity\nby the recollection of the agreeable arrangement which he had made\nbetween Mr. Tyrrel, and his friend Sir Bingo Binks.\n\nWe have heard of men of undoubted benevolence of character and\ndisposition, whose principal delight was to see a miserable criminal,\ndegraded alike by his previous crimes, and the sentence which he had\nincurred, conclude a vicious and wretched life, by an ignominious and\npainful death. It was some such inconsistency of character which induced\nhonest Captain MacTurk, who had really been a meritorious officer, and\nwas a good-natured, honourable, and well-intentioned man, to place his\nchief delight in setting his friends by the ears, and then acting as\numpire in the dangerous rencontres, which, according to his code of\nhonour, were absolutely necessary to restore peace and cordiality. We\nleave the explanation of such anomalies to the labours of craniologists,\nfor they seem to defy all the researches of the Ethic philosopher.\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[I-18] A kettle of fish is a _f\u00c3\u00aate-champ\u00c3\u00aatre_ of a particular kind, which\nis to other _f\u00c3\u00aates-champ\u00c3\u00aatres_ what the piscatory eclogues of Brown or\nSannazario are to pastoral poetry. A large caldron is boiled by the side\nof a salmon river, containing a quantity of water, thickened with salt\nto the consistence of brine. In this the fish is plunged when taken, and\neaten by the company _fronde super viridi_. This is accounted the best\nway of eating salmon, by those who desire to taste the fish in a state\nof extreme freshness. Others prefer it after being kept a day or two,\nwhen the curd melts into oil, and the fish becomes richer and more\nluscious. The more judicious gastronomes eat no other sauce than a\nspoonful of the water in which the salmon is boiled, together with a\nlittle pepper and vinegar.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nDISAPPOINTMENT.\n\n    _Evans._ I pray you now, good Master Slender's serving-man, and\n    friend Simple by your name, which way have you looked for Master\n    Caius?\n\n    _Slender._ Marry, sir, the City-ward, the Park-ward, every way; Old\n    Windsor way, and every way.\n\n_Merry Wives of Windsor._\n\n\nSir Bingo Binks received the Captain's communication with the same\ndogged sullenness he had displayed at sending the challenge; a most\nungracious _humph_, ascending, as it were, from the very bottom of his\nstomach, through the folds of a Belcher handkerchief, intimating his\nacquiescence, in a tone nearly as gracious as that with which the drowsy\ntraveller acknowledges the intimation of the slipshod ostler, that it is\non the stroke of five, and the horn will sound in a minute. Captain\nMacTurk by no means considered this ejaculation as expressing a proper\nestimate of his own trouble and services. \"Humph?\" he replied; \"and what\ndoes that mean, Sir Bingo? Have not I here had the trouble to put you\njust into the neat road; and would you have been able to make a handsome\naffair out of it at all, after you had let it hang so long in the wind,\nif I had not taken on myself to make it agreeable to the gentleman, and\ncooked as neat a mess out of it as I have seen a Frenchman do out of a\nstale sprat?\"\n\nSir Bingo saw it was necessary to mutter some intimation of acquiescence\nand acknowledgment, which, however inarticulate, was sufficient to\nsatisfy the veteran, to whom the adjustment of a personal affair of this\nkind was a labour of love, and who now, kindly mindful of his promise to\nTyrrel, hurried away as if he had been about the most charitable action\nupon earth, to secure the attendance of some one as a witness on the\nstranger's part.\n\nMr. Winterblossom was the person whom MacTurk had in his own mind\npitched upon as the fittest person to perform this act of benevolence,\nand he lost no time in communicating his wish to that worthy gentleman.\nBut Mr. Winterblossom, though a man of the world, and well enough\nacquainted with such matters, was by no means so passionately addicted\nto them as was the man of peace, Captain Hector MacTurk. As a _bon\nvivant_, he hated trouble of any kind, and the shrewd selfishness of his\ndisposition enabled him to foresee, that a good deal might accrue to all\nconcerned in the course of this business. He, therefore, coolly replied,\nthat he knew nothing of Mr. Tyrrel--not even whether he was a gentleman\nor not; and besides, he had received no regular application in his\nbehalf--he did not, therefore, feel himself at all inclined to go to the\nfield as his second. This refusal drove the poor Captain to despair. He\nconjured his friend to be more public-spirited, and entreated him to\nconsider the reputation of the Well, which was to them as a common\ncountry, and the honour of the company to which they both belonged, and\nof which Mr. Winterblossom was in a manner the proper representative, as\nbeing, with consent of all, the perpetual president. He reminded him\nhow many quarrels had been nightly undertaken and departed from on the\nensuing morning, without any suitable consequences--said, \"that people\nbegan to talk of the place oddly; and that, for his own part, he found\nhis own honour so nearly touched, that he had begun to think he himself\nwould be obliged to bring somebody or other to account, for the general\ncredit of the Well; and now, just when the most beautiful occasion had\narisen to put every thing on a handsome footing, it was hard--it was\ncruel--it was most unjustifiable--in Mr. Winterblossom, to decline so\nsimple a matter as was requested of him.\"\n\nDry and taciturn as the Captain was on all ordinary occasions, he\nproved, on the present, eloquent and almost pathetic; for the tears came\ninto his eyes when he recounted the various quarrels which had become\naddled, notwithstanding his best endeavours to hatch them into an\nhonourable meeting; and here was one, at length, just chipping the\nshell, like to be smothered, for want of the most ordinary concession on\nthe part of Winterblossom. In short, that gentleman could not hold out\nany longer. \"It was,\" he said, \"a very foolish business, he thought; but\nto oblige Sir Bingo and Captain MacTurk, he had no objection to walk\nwith them about noon as far as the Buck-stane, although he must observe\nthe day was hazy, and he had felt a prophetic twinge or two, which\nlooked like a visit of his old acquaintance podagra.\"\n\n\"Never mind that, my excellent friend,\" said the Captain, \"a sup out of\nSir Bingo's flask is like enough to put that to rights; and by my soul,\nit is not the thing he is like to leave behind him on this sort of\noccasion, unless I be far mistaken in my man.\"\n\n\"But,\" said Winterblossom, \"although I comply with your wishes thus far,\nCaptain MacTurk, I by no means undertake for certain to back this same\nMaster Tyrrel, of whom I know nothing at all, but only agree to go to\nthe place in hopes of preventing mischief.\"\n\n\"Never fash your beard about that, Mr. Winterblossom,\" replied the\nCaptain; \"for a little mischief, as you call it, is become a thing\nabsolutely necessary to the credit of the place; and I am sure, whatever\nbe the consequences, they cannot in the present instance be very fatal\nto any body; for here is a young fellow that, if he should have a\nmisfortune, nobody will miss, for nobody knows him; then there is Sir\nBingo, whom every body knows so well, that they will miss him all the\nless.\"\n\n\"And there will be Lady Bingo, a wealthy and handsome young widow,\" said\nWinterblossom, throwing his hat upon his head with the grace and\npretension of former days, and sighing to see, as he looked in the\nmirror, how much time, that had whitened his hair, rounded his stomach,\nwrinkled his brow, and bent down his shoulders, had disqualified him, as\nhe expressed it, \"for entering for such a plate.\"\n\nSecure of Winterblossom, the Captain's next anxiety was to obtain the\npresence of Dr. Quackleben, who, although he wrote himself M.D., did not\nby any means decline practice as a surgeon, when any job offered for\nwhich he was likely to be well paid, as was warranted in the present\ninstance, the wealthy baronet being a party principally concerned. The\nDoctor, therefore, like the eagle scenting the carnage, seized, at the\nfirst word, the huge volume of morocco leather which formed his case of\nportable instruments, and uncoiled before the Captain, with ostentatious\ndisplay, its formidable and glittering contents, upon which he began to\nlecture as upon a copious and interesting text, until the man of war\nthought it necessary to give him a word of caution.\n\n\"Och,\" says he, \"I do pray you, Doctor, to carry that packet of yours\nunder the breast of your coat, or in your pocket, or somewhere out of\nsight, and by no means to produce or open it before the parties. For\nalthough scalpels, and tourniquets, and pincers, and the like, are very\ningenious implements, and pretty to behold, and are also useful when\ntime and occasion call for them, yet I have known the sight of them take\naway a man's fighting stomach, and so lose their owner a job, Dr.\nQuackleben.\"\n\n\"By my faith, Captain MacTurk,\" said the Doctor, \"you speak as if you\nwere graduated!--I have known these treacherous articles play their\nmaster many a cursed trick. The very sight of my forceps, without the\nleast effort on my part, once cured an inveterate toothache of three\ndays' duration, prevented the extraction of a carious molendinar, which\nit was the very end of their formation to achieve, and sent me home\nminus a guinea.--But hand me that great-coat, Captain, and we will place\nthe instruments in ambuscade, until they are called into action in due\ntime. I should think something will happen--Sir Bingo is a sure shot at\na moorcock.\"\n\n\"Cannot say,\" replied MacTurk; \"I have known the pistol shake many a\nhand that held the fowlingpiece fast enough. Yonder Tyrrel looks like a\nteevilish cool customer--I watched him the whole time I was delivering\nmy errand, and I can promise you he is mettle to the backbone.\"\n\n\"Well--I will have my bandages ready _secundum artem_,\" replied the man\nof medicine. \"We must guard against h\u00c3\u00a6morrhage--Sir Bingo is a plethoric\nsubject.--One o'clock, you say--at the Buck-stane--I will be punctual.\"\n\n\"Will you not walk with us?\" said Captain MacTurk, who seemed willing to\nkeep his whole convoy together on this occasion, lest, peradventure, any\nof them had fled from under his patronage.\n\n\"No,\" replied the Doctor, \"I must first make an apology to worthy Mrs.\nBlower, for I had promised her my arm down to the river-side, where they\nare all to eat a kettle of fish.\"\n\n\"By Cot! and I hope we shall make them a prettier kettle of fish than\nwas ever seen at St. Ronan's,\" said the Captain, rubbing his hands.\n\n\"Don't say _we_, Captain,\" replied the cautious Doctor; \"I for one have\nnothing to do with the meeting--wash my hands of it. No, no, I cannot\nafford to be clapt up as accessory.--You ask me to meet you at the\nBuck-stane--no purpose assigned--I am willing to oblige my worthy\nfriend, Captain MacTurk--walk that way, thinking of nothing\nparticular--hear the report of pistols--hasten to the spot--fortunately\njust in time to prevent the most fatal consequences--chance most\nopportunely to have my case of instruments with me--indeed, generally\nwalk with them about me--_nunquam non paratus_--then give my\nprofessional definition of the wound and state of the patient. That is\nthe way to give evidence, Captain, before sheriffs, coroners, and such\nsort of folk--never commit one's self--it is a rule of our profession.\"\n\n\"Well, well, Doctor,\" answered the Captain, \"you know your own ways\nbest; and so you are but there to give a chance of help in case of\naccident, all the laws of honour will be fully complied with. But it\nwould be a foul reflection upon me, as a man of honour, if I did not\ntake care that there should be somebody to come in thirdsman between\nDeath and my principal.\"\n\nAt the awful hour of one afternoon, there arrived upon the appointed\nspot Captain MacTurk, leading to the field the valorous Sir Bingo, not\nexactly straining like a greyhound in the slips, but rather looking\nmoody like a butcher's bull-dog, which knows he must fight since his\nmaster bids him. Yet the Baronet showed no outward flinching or\nabatement of courage, excepting, that the tune of Jenny Sutton, which he\nhad whistled without intermission since he left the Hotel, had, during\nthe last half mile of their walk, sunk into silence; although, to look\nat the muscles of the mouth, projection of the lip, and vacancy of the\neye, it seemed as if the notes were still passing through his mind, and\nthat he whistled Jenny Sutton in his imagination. Mr. Winterblossom came\ntwo minutes after this happy pair, and the Doctor was equally punctual.\n\n\"Upon my soul,\" said the former, \"this is a mighty silly affair, Sir\nBingo, and might, I think, be easily taken up, at less risk to all\nparties than a meeting of this kind. You should recollect, Sir Bingo,\nthat you have much depending upon your life--you are a married man, Sir\nBingo.\"\n\nSir Bingo turned the quid in his mouth, and squirted out the juice in a\nmost coachman-like manner.\n\n\"Mr. Winterblossom,\" said the Captain, \"Sir Bingo has in this matter put\nhimself in my hands, and unless you think yourself more able to direct\nhis course than I am, I must frankly tell you, that I will be disobliged\nby your interference. You may speak to your own friend as much as you\nplease; and if you find yourself authorized to make any proposal, I\nshall be desirous to lend an ear to it on the part of my worthy\nprincipal, Sir Bingo. But I will be plain with you, that I do not\ngreatly approve of settlements upon the field, though I hope I am a\nquiet and peaceable man. But here is our honour to be looked after in\nthe first place; and moreover, I must insist that every proposal for\naccommodation shall originate with your party or yourself.\"\n\n\"_My_ party?\" answered Winterblossom; \"why really, though I came hither\nat your request, Captain MacTurk, yet I must see more of the matter, ere\nI can fairly pronounce myself second to a man I never saw but once.\"\n\n\"And, perhaps, may never see again,\" said the Doctor, looking at his\nwatch; \"for it is ten minutes past the hour, and here is no Mr. Tyrrel.\"\n\n\"Hey! what's that you say, Doctor?\" said the Baronet, awakened from his\napathy.\n\n\"He speaks tamned nonsense,\" said the Captain, pulling out a huge,\nold-fashioned, turnip-shaped implement, with a blackened silver\ndial-plate. \"It is not above three minutes after one by the true time,\nand I will uphold Mr. Tyrrel to be a man of his word--never saw a man\ntake a thing more coolly.\"\n\n\"Not more coolly than he takes his walk this way,\" said the Doctor; \"for\nthe hour is as I tell you--remember, I am professional--have pulses to\ncount by the second and half-second--my timepiece must go as true as the\nsun.\"\n\n\"And I have mounted guard a thousand times by my watch,\" said the\nCaptain; \"and I defy the devil to say that Hector MacTurk did not always\ndischarge his duty to the twentieth part of the fraction of a second--it\nwas my great grandmother, Lady Killbracklin's, and I will maintain its\nreputation against any timepiece that ever went upon wheels.\"\n\n\"Well, then, look at your own watch, Captain,\" said Winterblossom, \"for\ntime stands still with no man, and while we speak the hour advances. On\nmy word, I think this Mr. Tyrrel intends to humbug us.\"\n\n\"Hey! what's that you say?\" said Sir Bingo, once more starting from his\nsullen reverie.\n\n\"I shall not look at my watch upon no such matter,\" said the Captain;\n\"nor will I any way be disposed to doubt your friend's honour, Mr.\nWinterblossom.\"\n\n\"_My_ friend?\" said Mr. Winterblossom; \"I must tell you once more,\nCaptain, that this Mr. Tyrrel is no friend of mine--none in the world.\nHe is your friend, Captain MacTurk; and I own, if he keeps us waiting\nmuch longer on this occasion, I will be apt to consider his friendship\nas of very little value.\"\n\n\"And how dare you, then, say that the man is my friend?\" said the\nCaptain, knitting his brows in a most formidable manner.\n\n\"Pooh! pooh! Captain,\" answered Winterblossom, coolly, if not\ncontemptuously--\"keep all that for silly boys; I have lived in the world\ntoo long either to provoke quarrels, or to care about them. So, reserve\nyour fire; it is all thrown away on such an old cock as I am. But I\nreally wish we knew whether this fellow means to come--twenty minutes\npast the hour--I think it is odds that you are bilked, Sir Bingo?\"\n\n\"Bilked! hey!\" cried Sir Bingo; \"by Gad, I always thought so--I wagered\nwith Mowbray he was a raff--I am had, by Gad. I'll wait no longer than\nthe half hour, by Gad, were he a field-marshal.\"\n\n\"You will be directed in that matter by your friend, if you please, Sir\nBingo,\" said the Captain.\n\n\"D---- me if I will,\" returned the Baronet--\"Friend? a pretty friend, to\nbring me out here on such a fool's errand! I knew the fellow was a\nraff--but I never thought you, with all your chaff about honour, such a\nd----d spoon as to bring a message from a fellow who has fled the pit!\"\n\n\"If you regret so much having come here to no purpose,\" said the\nCaptain, in a very lofty tone, \"and if you think I have used you like a\nspoon, as you say, I will have no objection in life to take Mr. Tyrrel's\nplace, and serve your occasion, my boy!\"\n\n\"By ----! and if you like it, you may fire away, and welcome,\" said Sir\nBingo; \"and I'll spin a crown for first shot, for I do not understand\nbeing brought here for nothing, d---- me!\"\n\n\"And there was never man alive so ready as I am to give you something to\nstay your stomach,\" said the irritable Highlander.\n\n[Illustration]\n\n\"Oh fie, gentlemen! fie, fie, fie!\" exclaimed the pacific Mr.\nWinterblossom--\"For shame, Captain--Out upon you, Sir Bingo, are you\nmad?--what, principal and second!--the like was never heard of--never.\"\n\nThe parties were in some degree recalled to their more cool\nrecollections by this expostulation, yet continued a short quarter-deck\nwalk to and fro, upon parallel lines, looking at each other sullenly as\nthey passed, and bristling like two dogs who have a mind to quarrel, yet\nhesitate to commence hostilities. During this promenade, also, the\nperpendicular and erect carriage of the veteran, rising on his toes at\nevery step, formed a whimsical contrast with the heavy loutish shuffle\nof the bulky Baronet, who had, by dint of practice, very nearly attained\nthat most enviable of all carriages, the gait of a shambling Yorkshire\nostler. His coarse spirit was now thoroughly kindled, and like iron, or\nany other baser metal, which is slow in receiving heat, it retained long\nthe smouldering and angry spirit of resentment that had originally\nbrought him to the place, and now rendered him willing to wreak his\nuncomfortable feelings upon the nearest object which occurred, since the\nfirst purpose of his coming thither was frustrated. In his own phrase,\nhis pluck was up, and finding himself in a fighting humour, he thought\nit a pity, like Bob Acres, that so much good courage should be thrown\naway. As, however, that courage after all consisted chiefly in ill\nhumour; and as, in the demeanour of the Captain, he read nothing\ndeferential or deprecatory of his wrath, he began to listen with more\nattention to the arguments of Mr. Winterblossom, who entreated them not\nto sully, by private quarrel, the honour they had that day so happily\nacquired without either blood or risk.\n\n\"It was now,\" he said, \"three quarters of an hour past the time\nappointed for this person, who calls himself Tyrrel, to meet Sir Bingo\nBinks. Now, instead of standing squabbling here, which serves no\npurpose, I propose we should reduce to writing the circumstances which\nattend this affair, for the satisfaction of the company at the Well, and\nthat the memorandum shall be regularly attested by our subscriptions;\nafter which, I shall farther humbly propose that it be subjected to the\nrevision of the Committee of Management.\"\n\n\"I object to any revision of a statement to which my name shall be\nappended,\" said the Captain.\n\n\"Right--very true, Captain,\" said the complaisant Mr. Winterblossom;\n\"undoubtedly you know best, and your signature is completely sufficient\nto authenticate this transaction--however, as it is the most important\nwhich has occurred since the Spring was established, I propose we shall\nall sign the _proc\u00c3\u00a8s-verbal_, as I may term it.\"\n\n\"Leave me out, if you please,\" said the Doctor, not much satisfied that\nboth the original quarrel and the by-battle had passed over without any\noccasion for the offices of a Machaon; \"leave me out, if you please; for\nit does not become me to be ostensibly concerned in any proceedings,\nwhich have had for their object a breach of the peace. And for the\nimportance of waiting here for an hour, in a fine afternoon, it is my\nopinion there was a more important service done to the Well of St.\nRonan's, when I, Quentin Quackleben, M.D., cured Lady Penelope\nPenfeather of her seventh attack upon the nerves, attended with febrile\nsymptoms.\"\n\n\"No disparagement to your skill at all, Doctor,\" said Mr. Winterblossom;\n\"but I conceive the lesson which this fellow has received will be a\ngreat means to prevent improper persons from appearing at the Spring\nhereafter; and, for my part, I shall move that no one be invited to dine\nat the table in future, till his name is regularly entered as a member\nof the company, in the lists at the public room. And I hope both Sir\nBingo and the Captain will receive the thanks of the company, for their\nspirited conduct in expelling the intruder.--Sir Bingo, will you allow\nme to apply to your flask--a little twinge I feel, owing to the dampness\nof the grass.\"\n\nSir Bingo, soothed by the consequence he had acquired, readily imparted\nto the invalid a thimbleful of his cordial, which, we believe, had been\nprepared by some cunning chemist in the wilds of Glenlivat. He then\nfilled a bumper, and extended it towards the veteran, as an unequivocal\nsymptom of reconciliation. The real turbinacious flavour no sooner\nreached the nose of the Captain, than the beverage was turned down his\nthroat with symptoms of most unequivocal applause.\n\n\"I shall have some hope of the young fellows of this day,\" he said, \"now\nthat they begin to give up their Dutch and French distilled waters, and\nstick to genuine Highland ware. By Cot, it is the only liquor fit for a\ngentleman to drink in a morning, if he can have the good fortune to come\nby it, you see.\"\n\n\"Or after dinner either, Captain,\" said the Doctor, to whom the glass\nhad passed in rotation; \"it is worth all the wines in France for\nflavour, and more cordial to the system besides.\"\n\n\"And now,\" said the Captain, \"that we may not go off the ground with any\nthing on our stomachs worse than the whisky, I can afford to say, (as\nCaptain Hector MacTurk's character is tolerably well established,) that\nI am sorry for the little difference that has occurred betwixt me and my\nworthy friend, Sir Bingo, here.\"\n\n\"And since you are so civil, Captain,\" said Sir Bingo, \"why, I am sorry\ntoo--only it would put the devil out of temper to lose so fine a fishing\nday--wind south--fine air on the pool--water settled from the\nflood--just in trim--and I dare say three pairs of hooks have passed\nover my cast before this time!\"\n\nHe closed this elaborate lamentation with a libation of the same cordial\nwhich he had imparted to his companions; and they returned in a body to\nthe Hotel, where the transactions of the morning were soon afterwards\nannounced to the company, by the following program:--\n\n\n    STATEMENT.\n\n    \"Sir Bingo Binks, baronet, having found himself aggrieved by the\n    uncivil behaviour of an individual calling himself Francis Tyrrel,\n    now or lately a resident at the Cleikum Inn, Aultoun of St. Ronan's;\n    and having empowered Captain Hector MacTurk to wait upon the said\n    Mr. Tyrrel to demand an apology, under the alternative of personal\n    satisfaction, according to the laws of honour and the practice of\n    gentlemen, the said Tyrrel voluntarily engaged to meet the said Sir\n    Bingo Binks, baronet, at the Buck-stane, near St. Ronan's Burn, upon\n    this present day, being Wednesday ---- August. In consequence of\n    which appointment, we, the undersigned, did attend at the place\n    named, from one o'clock till two, without seeing or hearing any\n    thing whatever of the said Francis Tyrrel, or any one in his\n    behalf--which fact we make thus publicly known, that all men, and\n    particularly the distinguished company assembled at the Fox Hotel,\n    may be duly apprized of the character and behaviour of the said\n    Francis Tyrrel, in case of his again presuming to intrude himself\n    into the society of persons of honour.\n\n    \"The Fox Inn and Hotel, St. Ronan's Well--August 18--.\n\n    (Signed)\n    \"BINGO BINKS,\n    HECTOR MACTURK,\n    PHILIP WINTERBLOSSOM.\"\n\nA little lower followed this separate attestation:\n\n    \"I, Quentin Quackleben, M.D., F.R.S., D.E., B.L., X.Z., &c. &c.,\n    being called upon to attest what I know in the said matter, do\n    hereby verify, that being by accident at the Buck-stane, near St.\n    Ronan's Burn, on this present day, at the hour of one afternoon, and\n    chancing to remain there for the space of nearly an hour, conversing\n    with Sir Bingo Binks, Captain MacTurk, and Mr. Winterblossom, we did\n    not, during that time, see or hear any thing of or from the person\n    calling himself Francis Tyrrel, whose presence at that place seemed\n    to be expected by the gentlemen I have just named.\"\n\nThis affiche was dated like the former, and certified under the august\nhand of Quentin Quackleben, M.D., &c. &c. &c.\n\nAgain, and prefaced by the averment that an improper person had been\nlately introduced into the company of St. Ronan's Well, there came forth\na legislative enactment, on the part of the Committee, declaring, \"that\nno one shall in future be invited to the dinners, or balls, or other\nentertainments of the Well, until their names shall be regularly entered\nin the books kept for the purpose at the rooms.\" Lastly, there was a\nvote of thanks to Sir Bingo Binks and Captain MacTurk for their\nspirited conduct, and the pains which they had taken to exclude an\nimproper person from the company at St. Ronan's Well.\n\nThese annunciations speedily became the magnet of the day. All idlers\ncrowded to peruse them; and it would be endless to notice the \"God bless\nme's\"--the \"Lord have a care of us\"--the \"Saw you ever the like's\" of\ngossips, any more than the \"Dear me's\" and \"Oh, laa's\" of the titupping\nmisses, and the oaths of the pantalooned or buck-skin'd beaux. The\ncharacter of Sir Bingo rose like the stocks at the news of a dispatch\nfrom the Duke of Wellington, and, what was extraordinary, attained some\nconsequence even in the estimation of his lady. All shook their heads at\nthe recollection of the unlucky Tyrrel, and found out much in his manner\nand address which convinced them that he was but an adventurer and\nswindler. A few, however, less partial to the Committee of Management,\n(for whenever there is an administration, there will soon arise an\nopposition,) whispered among themselves, that, to give the fellow his\ndue, the man, be he what he would, had only come among them, like the\ndevil, when he was called for; and honest Dame Blower blessed herself\nwhen she heard of such bloodthirsty doings as had been intended, and\n\"thanked God that honest Doctor Kickherben had come to nae harm amang a'\ntheir nonsense.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nTHE CONSULTATION.\n\n     _Clown._ I hope here be proofs.--\n\n_Measure for Measure._\n\n\nThe borough of ---- lies, as all the world knows, about fourteen miles\ndistant from St. Ronan's, being the county town of that shire, which, as\ndescribed in the Tourist's Guide, numbers among its objects of interest\nthat gay and popular watering-place, whose fame, no doubt, will be\ngreatly enhanced by the present annals of its earlier history. As it is\nat present unnecessary to be more particular concerning the scene of our\nstory, we will fill up the blank left in the first name with the\nfictitious appellation of Marchthorn, having often found ourselves\nembarrassed in the course of a story, by the occurrence of an ugly\nhiatus, which we cannot always at first sight fill up, with the proper\nreference to the rest of the narrative.\n\nMarchthorn, then, was an old-fashioned Scottish town, the street of\nwhich, on market-day, showed a reasonable number of stout great-coated\nyeomen, bartering or dealing for the various commodities of their farms;\nand on other days of the week, only a few forlorn burghers, crawling\nabout like half-awakened flies, and watching the town steeple till the\nhappy sound of twelve strokes from Time's oracle should tell them it\nwas time to take their meridian dram. The narrow windows of the shops\nintimated very imperfectly the miscellaneous contents of the interior,\nwhere every merchant, as the shopkeepers of Marchthorn were termed,\n_more Scotico_, sold every thing that could be thought of. As for\nmanufactures, there were none, except that of the careful Town-Council,\nwho were mightily busied in preparing the warp and woof, which, at the\nend of every five or six years, the town of Marchthorn contributed, for\nthe purpose of weaving the fourth or fifth part of a member of\nParliament.\n\nIn such a town, it usually happens, that the Sheriff-clerk, especially\nsupposing him agent for several lairds of the higher order, is possessed\nof one of the best-looking houses; and such was that of Mr. Bindloose.\nNone of the smartness of the brick-built and brass-hammered mansion of a\nsouthern attorney appeared indeed in this mansion, which was a tall,\nthin, grim-looking building, in the centre of the town, with narrow\nwindows and projecting gables, notched into that sort of descent, called\ncrow-steps, and having the lower casements defended by stancheons of\niron; for Mr. Bindloose, as frequently happens, kept a branch of one of\nthe two national banks, which had been lately established in the town of\nMarchthorn.\n\nTowards the door of this tenement, there advanced slowly up the ancient,\nbut empty streets of this famous borough, a vehicle, which, had it\nappeared in Piccadilly, would have furnished unremitted laughter for a\nweek, and conversation for a twelvemonth. It was a two-wheeled vehicle,\nwhich claimed none of the modern appellations of tilbury, tandem,\ndennet, or the like; but aspired only to the humble name of that almost\nforgotten accommodation, a whiskey; or, according to some authorities, a\ntim-whiskey. Green was, or had been, its original colour, and it was\nplaced sturdily and safely low upon its little old-fashioned wheels,\nwhich bore much less than the usual proportion to the size of the\ncarriage which they sustained. It had a calash head, which had been\npulled up, in consideration either to the dampness of the morning air,\nor to the retiring delicacy of the fair form which, shrouded by leathern\ncurtains, tenanted this venerable specimen of antediluvian\ncoach-building.\n\nBut, as this fair and modest dame noway aspired to the skill of a\ncharioteer, the management of a horse, which seemed as old as the\ncarriage he drew, was in the exclusive charge of an old fellow in a\npostilion's jacket, whose grey hairs escaped on each side of an\nold-fashioned velvet jockey-cap, and whose left shoulder was so\nconsiderably elevated above his head, that it seemed, as if, with little\neffort, his neck might have been tucked under his arm, like that of a\nroasted grouse-cock. This gallant equerry was mounted on a steed as old\nas that which toiled betwixt the shafts of the carriage, and which he\nguided by a leading rein. Goading one animal with his single spur, and\nstimulating the other with his whip, he effected a reasonable trot upon\nthe causeway, which only terminated when the whiskey stopped at Mr.\nBindloose's door--an event of importance enough to excite the curiosity\nof the inhabitants of that and the neighbouring houses. Wheels were laid\naside, needles left sticking in the half-finished seams, and many a\nnose, spectacled and unspectacled, was popped out of the adjoining\nwindows, which had the good fortune to command a view of Mr. Bindloose's\nfront door. The faces of two or three giggling clerks were visible at\nthe barred casements of which we have spoken, much amused at the descent\nof an old lady from this respectable carriage, whose dress and\nappearance might possibly have been fashionable at the time when her\nequipage was new. A satin cardinal, lined with grey squirrels' skin, and\na black silk bonnet, trimmed with crape, were garments which did not now\nexcite the respect, which in their fresher days they had doubtless\ncommanded. But there was that in the features of the wearer, which would\nhave commanded Mr. Bindloose's best regard, though it had appeared in\nfar worse attire; for he beheld the face of an ancient customer, who had\nalways paid her law expenses with the ready penny, and whose accompt\nwith the bank was balanced by a very respectable sum at her credit. It\nwas, indeed, no other than our respected friend, Mrs. Dods of the\nCleikum Inn, St. Ronan's, Aultoun.\n\nNow her arrival intimated matter of deep import. Meg was a person of all\nothers most averse to leave her home, where, in her own opinion at\nleast, nothing went on well without her immediate superintendence.\nLimited, therefore, as was her sphere, she remained fixed in the centre\nthereof; and few as were her satellites, they were under the necessity\nof performing their revolutions around her, while she herself continued\nstationary. Saturn, in fact, would be scarce more surprised at a passing\ncall from the Sun, than Mr. Bindloose at this unexpected visit of his\nold client. In one breath he rebuked the inquisitive impertinence of his\nclerks, in another stimulated his housekeeper, old Hannah--for Mr.\nBindloose was a bluff bachelor--to get tea ready in the green parlour;\nand while yet speaking, was at the side of the whiskey, unclasping the\ncurtains, rolling down the apron, and assisting his old friend to\ndismount.\n\n\"The japanned tea-caddie, Hannah--the best bohea--bid Tib kindle a spark\nof fire--the morning's damp--Draw in the giggling faces of ye, ye d----d\nidle scoundrels, or laugh at your ain toom pouches--it will be lang or\nyour weeldoing fill them.\" This was spoken, as the honest lawyer himself\nmight have said, _in transitu_, the rest by the side of the carriage.\n\"My stars, Mrs. Dods, and is this really your ain sell, _in propria\npersona_?--Wha lookit for you at such a time of day?--Anthony, how's a'\nwi' ye, Anthony?--so ye hae taen the road again, Anthony--help us down\nwi' the apron, Anthony--that will do.--Lean on me, Mrs. Dods--help your\nmistress, Anthony--put the horses in my stable--the lads will give you\nthe key.--Come away, Mrs. Dods--I am blithe to see you straight your\nlegs on the causeway of our auld borough again--come in by, and we'll\nsee to get you some breakfast, for ye hae been asteer early this\nmorning.\"\n\n\"I am a sair trouble to you, Mr. Bindloose,\" said the old lady,\naccepting the offer of his arm, and accompanying him into the house; \"I\nam e'en a sair trouble to you, but I could not rest till I had your\nadvice on something of moment.\"\n\n\"Happy will I be to serve you, my gude auld acquaintance,\" said the\nClerk; \"but sit you down--sit you down--sit you down, Mrs. Dods--meat\nand mess never hindered wark. Ye are something overcome wi' your\ntravel--the spirit canna aye bear through the flesh, Mrs. Dods; ye\nshould remember that your life is a precious one, and ye should take\ncare of your health, Mrs. Dods.\"\n\n\"My life precious!\" exclaimed Meg Dods; \"nane o' your whullywhaing, Mr.\nBindloose--Deil ane wad miss the auld girning alewife, Mr. Bindloose,\nunless it were here and there a puir body, and maybe the auld\nhouse-tyke, that wadna be sae weel guided, puir fallow.\"\n\n\"Fie, fie! Mrs. Dods,\" said the Clerk, in a tone of friendly rebuke; \"it\nvexes an auld friend to hear ye speak of yourself in that respectless\nsort of a way; and, as for quitting us, I bless God I have not seen you\nlook better this half score of years. But maybe you will be thinking of\nsetting your house in order, which is the act of a carefu' and of a\nChristian woman--O! it's an awfu' thing to die intestate, if we had\ngrace to consider it.\"\n\n\"Aweel, I daur say I'll consider that some day soon, Mr. Bindloose; but\nthat's no my present errand.\"\n\n\"Be it what it like, Mrs. Dods, ye are right heartily welcome here, and\nwe have a' the day to speak of the business in hand--_festina lente_,\nthat is the true law language--hooly and fairly, as one may say--ill\ntreating of business with an empty stomach--and here comes your tea, and\nI hope Hannah has made it to your taste.\"\n\nMeg sipped her tea--confessed Hannah's skill in the mysteries of the\nChinese herb--sipped again, then tried to eat a bit of bread and butter,\nwith very indifferent success; and notwithstanding the lawyer's\ncompliments to her good looks, seemed in reality, on the point of\nbecoming ill.\n\n\"In the deil's name, what is the matter!\" said the lawyer, too well\nread in a profession where sharp observation is peculiarly necessary, to\nsuffer these symptoms of agitation to escape him. \"Ay, dame? ye are\ntaking this business of yours deeper to heart than ever I kend you take\nony thing. Ony o' your banded debtors failed, or like to fail? What\nthen! cheer ye up--you can afford a little loss, and it canna be ony\ngreat matter, or I would doubtless have heard of it.\"\n\n\"In troth, but it _is_ a loss, Mr. Bindloose; and what say ye to the\nloss of a friend?\"\n\nThis was a possibility which had never entered the lawyer's long list of\ncalamities, and he was at some loss to conceive what the old lady could\npossibly mean by so sentimental a prolusion. But just as he began to\ncome out with his \"Ay, ay, we are all mortal, _Vita incerta, mors\ncertissima!_\" and two or three more pithy reflections, which he was in\nthe habit of uttering after funerals, when the will of the deceased was\nabout to be opened,--just then Mrs. Dods was pleased to become the\nexpounder of her own oracle.\n\n\"I see how it is, Mr. Bindloose,\" she said; \"I maun tell my ain ailment,\nfor you are no likely to guess it; and so, if ye will shut the door, and\nsee that nane of your giggling callants are listening in the passage, I\nwill e'en tell you how things stand with me.\"\n\nMr. Bindloose hastily arose to obey her commands, gave a cautionary\nglance into the Bank-office, and saw that his idle apprentices were fast\nat their desks--turned the key upon them, as if it were in a fit of\nabsence, and then returned, not a little curious to know what could be\nthe matter with his old friend; and leaving off all further attempts to\nput cases, quietly drew his chair near hers, and awaited her own time to\nmake her communication.\n\n\"Mr. Bindloose,\" said she, \"I am no sure that you may mind, about six or\nseven years ago, that there were twa daft English callants, lodgers of\nmine, that had some trouble from auld St. Ronan's about shooting on the\nSpringwell-head muirs.\"\n\n\"I mind it as weel as yesterday, Mistress,\" said the Clerk; \"by the same\ntoken you gave me a note for my trouble, (which wasna worth speaking\nabout,) and bade me no bring in a bill against the puir bairns--ye had\naye a kind heart, Mrs. Dods.\"\n\n\"Maybe, and maybe no, Mr. Bindloose--that is just as I find folk.--But\nconcerning these lads, they baith left the country, and, as I think, in\nsome ill blude wi' ane another, and now the auldest and the doucest of\nthe twa came back again about a fortnight sin' syne, and has been my\nguest ever since.\"\n\n\"Aweel, and I trust he is not at his auld tricks again, goodwife?\"\nanswered the Clerk. \"I havena sae muckle to say either wi' the new\nSheriff or the Bench of Justices as I used to hae, Mrs. Dods--and the\nProcurator-fiscal is very severe on poaching, being borne out by the new\nAssociation--few of our auld friends of the Killnakelty are able to come\nto the sessions now, Mrs. Dods.\"\n\n\"The waur for the country, Mr. Bindloose,\" replied the old lady--\"they\nwere decent, considerate men, that didna plague a puir herd callant\nmuckle about a moorfowl or a mawkin, unless he turned common fowler--Sir\nRobert Ringhorse used to say, the herd lads shot as mony gleds and pyots\nas they did game.--But new lords new laws--naething but fine and\nimprisonment, and the game no a feather the plentier. If I wad hae a\nbrace or twa of birds in the house, as every body looks for them after\nthe twelfth--I ken what they are like to cost me--And what for no?--risk\nmaun be paid for.--There is John Pirner himsell, that has keepit the\nmuir-side thirty year in spite of a' the lairds in the country, shoots,\nhe tells me, now-a-days, as if he felt a rape about his neck.\"\n\n\"It wasna about ony game business, then, that you wanted advice?\" said\nBindloose, who, though somewhat of a digresser himself, made little\nallowance for the excursions of others from the subject in hand.\n\n\"Indeed is it no, Mr. Bindloose,\" said Meg; \"but it is e'en about this\nunhappy callant that I spoke to you about.--Ye maun ken I have cleiket a\nparticular fancy to this lad, Francis Tirl--a fancy that whiles\nsurprises my very sell, Mr. Bindloose, only that there is nae sin in\nit.\"\n\n\"None--none in the world, Mrs. Dods,\" said the lawyer, thinking at the\nsame time within his own mind, \"Oho! the mist begins to clear up--the\nyoung poacher has hit the mark, I see--winged the old barren grey\nhen!--ay, ay,--a marriage-contract, no doubt--but I maun gie her\nline.--Ye are a wise woman, Mrs. Dods,\" he continued aloud, \"and can\ndoubtless consider the chances and the changes of human affairs.\"\n\n\"But I could never have considered what has befallen this puir lad, Mr.\nBindloose,\" said Mrs. Dods, \"through the malice of wicked men.--He\nlived, then, at the Cleikum, as I tell you, for mair than a fortnight,\nas quiet as a lamb on a lea-rig--a decenter lad never came within my\ndoor--ate and drank eneugh for the gude of the house, and nae mair than\nwas for his ain gude, whether of body or soul--cleared his bills ilka\nSaturday at e'en, as regularly as Saturday came round.\"\n\n\"An admirable customer, no doubt, Mrs. Dods,\" said the lawyer.\n\n\"Never was the like of him for that matter,\" answered the honest dame.\n\"But to see the malice of men!--some of thae landloupers and gill-flirts\ndown at the filthy puddle yonder, that they ca' the Waal, had heard of\nthis puir lad, and the bits of pictures that he made fashion of drawing,\nand they maun cuitle him awa doun to the bottle, where mony a bonny\nstory they had clecked, Mr. Bindloose, baith of Mr. Tirl and of mysell.\"\n\n\"A Commissary Court business,\" said the writer, going off again upon a\nfalse scent. \"I shall trim their jackets for them, Mrs. Dods, if you can\nbut bring tight evidence of the facts--I will soon bring them to fine\nand palinode--I will make them repent meddling with your good name.\"\n\n\"My gude name! What the sorrow is the matter wi' my name, Mr.\nBindloose?\" said the irritable client. \"I think ye hae been at the wee\ncappie this morning, for as early as it is--My gude name!--if ony body\ntouched my gude name, I would neither fash counsel nor commissary--I wad\nbe down amang them, like a jer-falcon amang a wheen wild-geese, and the\nbest amang them that dared to say ony thing of Meg Dods by what was\nhonest and civil, I wad sune see if her cockernonnie was made of her ain\nhair or other folk's. _My_ gude name, indeed!\"\n\n\"Weel, weel, Mrs. Dods, I was mista'en, that's a',\" said the writer, \"I\nwas mista'en; and I dare to say you would haud your ain wi' your\nneighbours as weel as ony woman in the land--But let us hear now what\nthe grief is, in one word.\"\n\n\"In one word, then, Clerk Bindloose, it is little short of--murder,\"\nsaid Meg, in a low tone, as if the very utterance of the word startled\nher.\n\n\"Murder! murder, Mrs. Dods?--it cannot be--there is not a word of it in\nthe Sheriff-office--the Procurator-fiscal kens nothing of it--there\ncould not be murder in the country, and me not hear of it--for God's\nsake, take heed what you say, woman, and dinna get yourself into\ntrouble.\"\n\n\"Mr. Bindloose, I can but speak according to my lights,\" said Mrs. Dods;\n\"you are in a sense a judge in Israel, at least you are one of the\nscribes having authority--and I tell you, with a wae and bitter heart,\nthat this puir callant of mine that was lodging in my house has been\nmurdered or kidnapped awa amang thae banditti folk down at the New Waal;\nand I'll have the law put in force against them, if it should cost me a\nhundred pounds.\"\n\nThe Clerk stood much astonished at the nature of Meg's accusation, and\nthe pertinacity with which she seemed disposed to insist upon it.\n\n\"I have this comfort,\" she continued, \"that whatever has happened, it\nhas been by no fault of mine, Mr. Bindloose; for weel I wot, before that\nbloodthirsty auld half-pay Philistine, MacTurk, got to speech of him, I\nclawed his cantle to some purpose with my hearth-besom.--But the poor\nsimple bairn himsell, that had nae mair knowledge of the wickedness of\nhuman nature than a calf has of a flesher's gully, he threepit to see\nthe auld hardened bloodshedder, and trysted wi' him to meet wi' some of\nthe gang at an hour certain that same day, and awa he gaed to keep\ntryst, but since that hour naebody ever has set een on him.--And the\nmansworn villains now want to put a disgrace on him, and say that he\nfled the country rather than face them!--a likely story--fled the\ncountry for them!--and leave his bill unsettled--him that was sae\nregular--and his portmantle and his fishing-rod and the pencils and\npictures he held sic a wark about!--It's my faithful belief, Mr.\nBindloose--and ye may trust me or no as ye like--that he had some foul\nplay between the Cleikum and the Buck-stane. I have thought it, and I\nhave dreamed it, and I will be at the bottom of it, or my name is not\nMeg Dods, and that I wad have them a' to reckon on.--Ay, ay, that's\nright, Mr. Bindloose, tak out your pen and inkhorn, and let us set about\nit to purpose.\"\n\nWith considerable difficulty, and at the expense of much\ncross-examination, Mr. Bindloose extracted from his client a detailed\naccount of the proceedings of the company at the Well towards Tyrrel, so\nfar as they were known to, or suspected by Meg, making notes, as the\nexamination proceeded, of what appeared to be matter of consequence.\nAfter a moment's consideration, he asked the dame the very natural\nquestion, how she came to be acquainted with the material fact, that a\nhostile appointment was made between Captain MacTurk and her lodger,\nwhen, according to her own account, it was made _intra parietes_, and\n_remotis testibus_?\n\n\"Ay, but we victuallers ken weel eneugh what goes on in our ain houses,\"\nsaid Meg--\"And what for no?--If ye _maun_ ken a' about it, I e'en\nlistened through the keyhole of the door.\"\n\n\"And do you say you heard them settle an appointment for a duel?\" said\nthe Clerk; \"and did you no take ony measures to hinder mischief, Mrs.\nDods, having such a respect for this lad as you say you have, Mrs.\nDods?--I really wadna have looked for the like o' this at your hands.\"\n\n\"In truth, Mr. Bindloose,\" said Meg, putting her apron to her eyes, \"and\nthat's what vexes me mair than a' the rest, and ye needna say muckle to\nane whose heart is e'en the sairer that she has been a thought to blame.\nBut there has been mony a challenge, as they ca' it, passed in my house,\nwhen thae daft lads of the Wildfire Club and the Helter-skelter were\nupon their rambles; and they had aye sense eneugh to make it up without\nfighting, sae that I really did not apprehend ony thing like\nmischief.--And ye maun think, moreover, Mr. Bindloose, that it would\nhave been an unco thing if a guest, in a decent and creditable public\nlike mine, was to have cried coward before ony of thae landlouping\nblackguards that live down at the hottle yonder.\"\n\n\"That is to say, Mrs. Dods, you were desirous your guest should fight\nfor the honour of your house,\" said Bindloose.\n\n\"What for no, Mr. Bindloose?--Isna that kind of fray aye about honour?\nand what for should the honour of a substantial, four-nooked, sclated\nhouse of three stories, no be foughten for, as weel as the credit of ony\nof these feckless callants that make such a fray about their\nreputation?--I promise you my house, the Cleikum, stood in the Auld Town\nof St. Ronan's before they were born, and it will stand there after they\nare hanged, as I trust some of them are like to be.\"\n\n\"Well, but perhaps your lodger had less zeal for the honour of the\nhouse, and has quietly taken himself out of harm's way,\" said Mr.\nBindloose; \"for if I understand your story, this meeting never took\nplace.\"\n\n\"Have less zeal!\" said Meg, determined to be pleased with no supposition\nof her lawyer, \"Mr. Bindloose, ye little ken him--I wish ye had seen him\nwhen he was angry!--I dared hardly face him mysell, and there are no\nmony folk that I am feared for--Meeting! there was nae meeting, I\ntrow--they never dared to meet him fairly--but I am sure waur came of it\nthan ever would have come of a meeting; for Anthony heard twa shots gang\noff as he was watering the auld naig down at the burn, and that is not\nfar frae the footpath that leads to the Buck-stane. I was angry at him\nfor no making on to see what the matter was, but he thought it was auld\nPirner out wi' the double barrel, and he wasna keen of making himself a\nwitness, in case he suld have been caa'd on in the Poaching Court.\"\n\n\"Well,\" said the Sheriff-clerk, \"and I dare say he did hear a poacher\nfire a couple of shots--nothing more likely. Believe me, Mrs. Dods, your\nguest had no fancy for the party Captain MacTurk invited him to--and\nbeing a quiet sort of man, he has just walked away to his own home, if\nhe has one--I am really sorry you have given yourself the trouble of\nthis long journey about so simple a matter.\"\n\nMrs. Dods remained with her eyes fixed on the ground in a very sullen\nand discontented posture, and when she spoke, it was in a tone of\ncorresponding displeasure.\n\n\"Aweel--aweel--live and learn, they say--I thought I had a friend in\nyou, Mr. Bindloose--I am sure I aye took your part when folk miscaa'd\nye, and said ye were this, that, and the other thing, and little better\nthan an auld sneck-drawing loon, Mr. Bindloose.--And ye have aye keepit\nmy penny of money, though, nae doubt, Tam Turnpenny lives nearer me, and\nthey say he allows half a per cent mair than ye do if the siller lies,\nand mine is but seldom steered.\"\n\n\"But ye have not the Bank's security, madam,\" said Mr. Bindloose,\nreddening. \"I say harm of nae man's credit--ill would it beseem me--but\nthere is a difference between Tam Turnpenny and the Bank, I trow.\"\n\n\"Weel, weel, Bank here Bank there, I thought I had a friend in you, Mr.\nBindloose; and here am I, come from my ain house all the way to yours\nfor sma' comfort, I think.\"\n\n\"My stars, madam,\" said the perplexed scribe, \"what would you have me to\ndo in such a blind story as yours, Mrs. Dods?--Be a thought\nreasonable--consider that there is no _Corpus delicti_.\"\n\n_\"Corpus delicti?_ and what's that?\" said Meg; \"something to be paid\nfor, nae doubt, for your hard words a' end in that.--And what for suld I\nno have a Corpus delicti, or a Habeas Corpus, or ony other Corpus that I\nlike, sae lang as I am willing to lick and lay down the ready siller?\"\n\n\"Lord help and pardon us, Mrs. Dods,\" said the distressed agent, \"ye\nmistake the matter a'thegether! When I say there is no Corpus delicti, I\nmean to say there is no proof that a crime has been committed.\"[I-19]\n\n\"And does the man say that murder is not a crime, than?\" answered Meg,\nwho had taken her own view of the subject far too strongly to be\nconverted to any other--\"Weel I wot it's a crime, baith by the law of\nGod and man, and mony a pretty man has been strapped for it.\"\n\n\"I ken all that very weel,\" answered the writer; \"but, my stars, Mrs.\nDods, there is nae evidence of murder in this case--nae proof that a man\nhas been slain--nae production of his dead body--and that is what we\ncall the Corpus delicti.\"\n\n\"Weel, than, the deil lick it out of ye,\" said Meg, rising in wrath,\n\"for I will awa hame again; and as for the puir lad's body, I'll hae it\nfund, if it cost me turning the earth for three miles round wi' pick and\nshool--if it were but to give the puir bairn Christian burial, and to\nbring punishment on MacTurk and the murdering crew at the Waal, and to\nshame an auld doited fule like yoursell, John Bindloose.\"\n\nShe rose in wrath to call her vehicle; but it was neither the interest\nnor the intention of the writer that his customer and he should part on\nsuch indifferent terms. He implored her patience, and reminded her that\nthe horses, poor things, had just come off their stage--an argument\nwhich sounded irresistible in the ears of the old she-publican, in whose\nearly education due care of the post-cattle mingled with the most sacred\nduties. She therefore resumed her seat again in a sullen mood, and Mr.\nBindloose was cudgelling his brains for some argument which might bring\nthe old lady to reason, when his attention was drawn by a noise in the\npassage.\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[I-19] For example, a man cannot be tried for murder merely in the case of\nthe non-appearance of an individual; there must be proof that the party\nhas been murdered.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nA PRAISER OF PAST TIMES.\n\n    ----Now your traveller,\n    He and his toothpick at my worship's mess.\n\n_King John._\n\n\nThe noise stated at the conclusion of last chapter to have disturbed Mr.\nBindloose, was the rapping of one, as in haste and impatience, at the\nBank-office door, which office was an apartment of the Banker's house,\non the left hand of his passage, as the parlour in which he had received\nMrs. Dods was upon the right.\n\nIn general, this office was patent to all having business there; but at\npresent, whatever might be the hurry of the party who knocked, the\nclerks within the office could not admit him, being themselves made\nprisoners by the prudent jealousy of Mr. Bindloose, to prevent them from\nlistening to his consultation with Mrs. Dods. They therefore answered\nthe angry and impatient knocking of the stranger only with stifled\ngiggling from within, finding it no doubt an excellent joke, that their\nmaster's precaution was thus interfering with their own discharge of\nduty.\n\nWith one or two hearty curses upon them, as the regular plagues of his\nlife, Mr. Bindloose darted into the passage, and admitted the stranger\ninto his official apartment. The doors both of the parlour and office\nremaining open, the ears of Luckie Dods (experienced, as the reader\nknows, in collecting intelligence) could partly overhear what passed.\nThe conversation seemed to regard a cash transaction of some importance,\nas Meg became aware when the stranger raised a voice which was naturally\nsharp and high, as he did when uttering the following words, towards the\nclose of a conversation which had lasted about five minutes--\"Premium?--Not\na pice, sir--not a courie--not a farthing--premium for a Bank of England\nbill?--d'ye take me for a fool, sir?--do not I know that you call forty\ndays par when you give remittances to London?\"\n\nMr. Bindloose was here heard to mutter something indistinctly about the\ncustom of the trade.\n\n\"Custom!\" retorted the stranger, \"no such thing--damn'd bad custom, if\nit is one--don't tell me of customs--'Sbodikins, man, I know the rate of\nexchange all over the world, and have drawn bills from Timbuctoo--My\nfriends in the Strand filed it along with Bruce's from Gondar--talk to\nme of premium on a Bank of England post-bill!--What d'ye look at the\nbill for?--D'ye think it doubtful--I can change it.\"\n\n\"By no means necessary,\" answered Bindloose, \"the bill is quite right;\nbut it is usual to indorse, sir.\"\n\n\"Certainly--reach me a pen--d'ye think I can write with my rattan?--What\nsort of ink is this?--yellow as curry sauce--never mind--there is my\nname--Peregrine Touchwood--I got it from the Willoughbies, my Christian\nname--Have I my full change here?\"\n\n\"Your full change, sir,\" answered Bindloose.\n\n\"Why, you should give _me_ a premium, friend, instead of me giving you\none.\"\n\n\"It is out of our way, I assure you, sir,\" said the Banker, \"quite out\nof our way--but if you would step into the parlour and take a cup of\ntea\"----\n\n\"Why, ay,\" said the stranger, his voice sounding more distinctly as\n(talking all the while, and ushered along by Mr. Bindloose) he left the\noffice and moved towards the parlour, \"a cup of tea were no such bad\nthing, if one could come by it genuine--but as for your premium\"----So\nsaying, he entered the parlour and made his bow to Mrs. Dods, who,\nseeing what she called a decent, purpose-like body, and aware that his\npocket was replenished with English and Scottish paper currency,\nreturned the compliment with her best curtsy.\n\nMr. Touchwood, when surveyed more at leisure, was a short, stout, active\nman, who, though sixty years of age and upwards, retained in his sinews\nand frame the elasticity of an earlier period. His countenance expressed\nself-confidence, and something like a contempt for those who had neither\nseen nor endured so much as he had himself. His short black hair was\nmingled with grey, but not entirely whitened by it. His eyes were\njet-black, deep-set, small, and sparkling, and contributed, with a short\nturned-up nose, to express an irritable and choleric habit. His\ncomplexion was burnt to a brick-colour by the vicissitudes of climate,\nto which it had been subjected; and his face, which at the distance of a\nyard or two seemed hale and smooth, appeared, when closely examined, to\nbe seamed with a million of wrinkles, crossing each other in every\ndirection possible, but as fine as if drawn by the point of a very\nsmall needle.[I-20] His dress was a blue coat and buff waistcoat, half\nboots remarkably well blacked, and a silk handkerchief tied with\nmilitary precision. The only antiquated part of his dress was a cocked\nhat of equilateral dimensions, in the button-hole of which he wore a\nvery small cockade. Mrs. Dods, accustomed to judge of persons by their\nfirst appearance, said, that in the three steps which he made from the\ndoor to the tea-table, she recognised, without the possibility of\nmistake, the gait of a person who was well to pass in the world; \"and\nthat,\" she added with a wink, \"is what we victuallers are seldom\ndeceived in. If a gold-laced waistcoat has an empty pouch, the plain\nswan's-down will be the brawer of the twa.\"\n\n\"A drizzling morning, good madam,\" said Mr. Touchwood, as with a view of\nsounding what sort of company he had got into.\n\n\"A fine saft morning for the crap, sir,\" answered Mrs. Dods, with equal\nsolemnity.\n\n\"Right, my good madam; _soft_ is the very word, though it has been some\ntime since I heard it. I have cast a double hank about the round world\nsince I last heard of a soft[I-21] morning.\"\n\n\"You will be from these parts, then?\" said the writer, ingeniously\nputting a case, which, he hoped, would induce the stranger to explain\nhimself. \"And yet, sir,\" he added, after a pause, \"I was thinking that\nTouchwood is not a Scottish name, at least that I ken of.\"\n\n\"Scottish name?--no,\" replied the traveller; \"but a man may have been in\nthese parts before, without being a native--or, being a native, he may\nhave had some reason to change his name--there are many reasons why men\nchange their names.\"\n\n\"Certainly, and some of them very good ones,\" said the lawyer; \"as in\nthe common case of an heir of entail, where deed of provision and\ntailzie is maist ordinarily implemented by taking up name and arms.\"\n\n\"Ay, or in the case of a man having made the country too hot for him\nunder his own proper appellative,\" said Mr. Touchwood.\n\n\"That is a supposition, sir,\" replied the lawyer, \"which it would ill\nbecome me to put.--But at any rate, if you knew this country formerly,\nye cannot but be marvellously pleased with the change we have been\nmaking since the American war--hill-sides bearing clover instead of\nheather--rents doubled, trebled, quadrupled--the auld reekie dungeons\npulled down, and gentlemen living in as good houses as you will see any\nwhere in England.\"\n\n\"Much good may it do them, for a pack of fools!\" replied Mr. Touchwood,\nhastily.\n\n\"You do not seem much delighted with our improvements, sir?\" said the\nbanker, astonished to hear a dissentient voice where he conceived all\nmen were unanimous.\n\n\"Pleased!\" answered the stranger--\"Yes, as much pleased as I am with the\ndevil, who I believe set many of them agoing. Ye have got an idea that\nevery thing must be changed--Unstable as water, ye shall not excel--I\ntell ye, there have been more changes in this poor nook of yours within\nthe last forty years, than in the great empires of the East for the\nspace of four thousand, for what I know.\"\n\n\"And why not,\" replied Bindloose, \"if they be changes for the better?\"\n\n\"But they are _not_ for the better,\" replied Mr. Touchwood, eagerly. \"I\nleft your peasantry as poor as rats indeed, but honest and industrious,\nenduring their lot in this world with firmness, and looking forward to\nthe next with hope--Now they are mere eye-servants--looking at their\nwatches, forsooth, every ten minutes, lest they should work for their\nmaster half an instant after loosing-time--And then, instead of studying\nthe Bible on the work days, to kittle the clergymen with doubtful points\nof controversy on the Sabbath, they glean all their theology from Tom\nPaine and Voltaire.\"\n\n\"Weel I wot the gentleman speaks truth,\" said Mrs. Dods. \"I fand a\nbundle of their bawbee blasphemies in my ain kitchen--But I trow I made\na clean house of the packman loon that brought them!--No content wi'\nturning the tawpies' heads wi' ballants, and driving them daft wi'\nribands, to cheat them out of their precious souls, and gie them the\ndeevil's ware, that I suld say sae, in exchange for the siller that suld\nsupport their puir father that's aff wark and bedridden!\"\n\n\"Father! madam,\" said the stranger; \"they think no more of their father\nthan Regan or Goneril.\"\n\n\"In gude troth, ye have skeel of our sect, sir,\" replied the dame; \"they\nare gomerils, every one of them--I tell them sae every hour of the day,\nbut catch them profiting by the doctrine.\"\n\n\"And then the brutes are turned mercenary, madam,\" said Mr. Touchwood,\n\"I remember when a Scottishman would have scorned to touch a shilling\nthat he had not earned, and yet was as ready to help a stranger as an\nArab of the desert. And now, I did but drop my cane the other day as I\nwas riding--a fellow who was working at the hedge made three steps to\nlift it--I thanked him, and my friend threw his hat on his head, and\n'damned my thanks, if that were all'--Saint Giles could not have\nexcelled him.\"\n\n\"Weel, weel,\" said the banker, \"that may be a' as you say, sir, and nae\ndoubt wealth makes wit waver; but the country's wealthy, that cannot be\ndenied, and wealth, sir, ye ken\"----\n\n\"I know wealth makes itself wings,\" answered the cynical stranger; \"but\nI am not quite sure we have it even now. You make a great show, indeed,\nwith building and cultivation; but stock is not capital, any more than\nthe fat of a corpulent man is health or strength.\"\n\n\"Surely, Mr. Touchwood,\" said Bindloose, who felt his own account in the\nmodern improvements, \"a set of landlords, living like lairds in good\nearnest, and tenants with better housekeeping than the lairds used to\nhave, and facing Whitsunday and Martinmas as I would face my\nbreakfast--if these are not signs of wealth, I do not know where to seek\nfor them.\"\n\n\"They are signs of folly, sir,\" replied Touchwood; \"folly that is poor,\nand renders itself poorer by desiring to be thought rich; and how they\ncome by the means they are so ostentatious of, you, who are a banker,\nperhaps can tell me better than I can guess.\"\n\n\"There is maybe an accommodation bill discounted now and then, Mr.\nTouchwood; but men must have accommodation, or the world would stand\nstill--accommodation is the grease that makes the wheels go.\"\n\n\"Ay, makes them go down hill to the devil,\" answered Touchwood. \"I left\nyou bothered about one Ayr bank, but the whole country is an Air bank\nnow, I think--And who is to pay the piper?--But it's all one--I will see\nlittle more of it--it is a perfect Babel, and would turn the head of a\nman who has spent his life with people who love sitting better than\nrunning, silence better than speaking, who never eat but when they are\nhungry, never drink but when thirsty, never laugh without a jest, and\nnever speak but when they have something to say. But here, it is all\nrun, ride, and drive--froth, foam, and flippancy--no steadiness--no\ncharacter.\"\n\n\"I'll lay the burden of my life,\" said Dame Dods, looking towards her\nfriend Bindloose, \"that the gentleman has been at the new Spaw-waal\nyonder!\"\n\n\"Spaw do you call it, madam?--If you mean the new establishment that has\nbeen spawned down yonder at St. Ronan's, it is the very fountain-head of\nfolly and coxcombry--a Babel for noise, and a Vanity-fair for\nnonsense--no well in your swamps tenanted by such a conceited colony of\nclamorous frogs.\"\n\n\"Sir, sir!\" exclaimed Dame Dods, delighted with the unqualified sentence\npassed upon her fashionable rivals, and eager to testify her respect for\nthe judicious stranger who had pronounced it,--\"will you let me have the\npleasure of pouring you out a dish of tea?\" And so saying, she took\nbustling possession of the administration which had hitherto remained in\nthe hands of Mr. Bindloose himself.\n\n\"I hope it is to your taste, sir,\" she continued, when the traveller\nhad accepted her courtesy with the grateful acknowledgment, which men\naddicted to speak a great deal usually show to a willing auditor.\n\n\"It is as good as we have any right to expect, ma'am,\" answered Mr.\nTouchwood; \"not quite like what I have drunk at Canton with old Fong\nQua--but the Celestial Empire does not send its best tea to Leadenhall\nStreet, nor does Leadenhall Street send its best to Marchthorn.\"\n\n\"That may be very true, sir,\" replied the dame; \"but I will venture to\nsay that Mr. Bindloose's tea is muckle better than you had at the\nSpaw-waal yonder.\"\n\n\"Tea, madam!--I saw none--Ash leaves and black-thorn leaves were brought\nin in painted canisters, and handed about by powder-monkeys in livery,\nand consumed by those who liked it, amidst the chattering of parrots and\nthe squalling of kittens. I longed for the days of the Spectator, when I\nmight have laid my penny on the bar, and retired without ceremony--But\nno--this blessed decoction was circulated under the auspices of some\nhalf-crazed blue-stocking or other, and we were saddled with all the\nformality of an entertainment, for this miserable allowance of a\ncockle-shell full of cat-lap per head.\"\n\n\"Weel, sir,\" answered Dame Dods, \"all I can say is, that if it had been\nmy luck to have served you at the Cleikum Inn, which our folk have kept\nfor these twa generations, I canna pretend to say ye should have had\nsuch tea as ye have been used to in foreign parts where it grows, but\nthe best I had I wad have gi'en it to a gentleman of your appearance,\nand I never charged mair than six-pence in all my time, and my father's\nbefore me.\"\n\n\"I wish I had known the Old Inn was still standing, madam,\" said the\ntraveller; \"I should certainly have been your guest, and sent down for\nthe water every morning--the doctors insist I must use Cheltenham, or\nsome substitute, for the bile--though, d--n them, I believe it's only\nto hide their own ignorance. And I thought this Spaw would have been the\nleast evil of the two; but I have been fairly overreached--one might as\nwell live in the inside of a bell. I think young St. Ronan's must be\nmad, to have established such a Vanity-fair upon his father's old\nproperty.\"\n\n\"Do you ken this St. Ronan's that now is?\" enquired the dame.\n\n\"By report only,\" said Mr. Touchwood; \"but I have heard of the family,\nand I think I have read of them, too, in Scottish history. I am sorry to\nunderstand they are lower in the world than they have been. This young\nman does not seem to take the best way to mend matters, spending his\ntime among gamblers and black-legs.\"\n\n\"I should be sorry if it were so,\" said honest Meg Dods, whose\nhereditary respect for the family always kept her from joining in any\nscandal affecting the character of the young Laird--\"My forbears, sir,\nhave had kindness frae his; and although maybe he may have forgotten all\nabout it, it wad ill become me to say ony thing of him that should not\nbe said of his father's son.\"\n\nMr. Bindloose had not the same motive for forbearance; he declaimed\nagainst Mowbray as a thoughtless dissipater of his own fortune, and that\nof others. \"I have some reason to speak,\" he said, \"having two of his\nnotes for L.100 each, which I discounted out of mere kindness and\nrespect for his ancient family, and which he thinks nae mair of\nretiring, than he does of paying the national debt--And here has he been\nraking every shop in Marchthorn, to fit out an entertainment for all the\nfine folk at the Well yonder; and tradesfolk are obliged to take his\nacceptances for their furnishings. But they may cash his bills that\nwill; I ken ane that will never advance a bawbee on ony paper that has\nJohn Mowbray either on the back or front of it. He had mair need to be\npaying the debts which he has made already, than making new anes, that\nhe may feed fules and flatterers.\"\n\n\"I believe he is likely to lose his preparations, too,\" said Mr.\nTouchwood, \"for the entertainment has been put off, as I heard, in\nconsequence of Miss Mowbray's illness.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay, puir thing!\" said Dame Margaret Dods: \"her health has been\nunsettled for this mony a day.\"\n\n\"Something wrong here, they tell me,\" said the traveller, pointing to\nhis own forehead significantly.\n\n\"God only kens,\" replied Mrs. Dods; \"but I rather suspect the heart than\nthe head--the puir thing is hurried here and there, and down to the\nWaal, and up again, and nae society or quiet at hame; and a' thing\nganging this unthrifty gait--nae wonder she is no that weel settled.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Touchwood, \"she is worse they say than she has been, and\nthat has occasioned the party at Shaws-Castle having been put off.\nBesides, now this fine young lord has come down to the Well, undoubtedly\nthey will wait her recovery.\"\n\n\"A lord!\" ejaculated the astonished Mrs. Dods; \"a lord come down to the\nWaal--they will be neither to haud nor to bind now--ance wud and aye\nwaur--a lord!--set them up and shute them forward--a lord!--the Lord\nhave a care o' us!--a lord at the hottle!--Maister Touchwood, it's my\nmind he will only prove to be a Lord o' Session.\"\n\n\"Nay, not so, my good lady,\" replied the traveller \"he is an English\nlord, and, as they say, a Lord of Parliament--but some folk pretend to\nsay there is a flaw in the title.\"\n\n\"I'll warrant is there--a dozen of them!\" said Meg, with alacrity--for\nshe could by no means endure to think on the accumulation of dignity\nlikely to accrue to the rival establishment, from its becoming the\nresidence of an actual nobleman. \"I'll warrant he'll prove a landlouping\nlord on their hand, and they will be e'en cheap o' the loss--And he has\ncome down out of order it's like, and nae doubt he'll no be lang there\nbefore he will recover his health, for the credit of the Spaw.\"\n\n\"Faith, madam, his present disorder is one which the Spaw will hardly\ncure--he is shot in the shoulder with a pistol-bullet--a robbery\nattempted, it seems--that is one of your new accomplishments--no such\nthing happened in Scotland in my time--men would have sooner expected to\nmeet with the phoenix than with a highwayman.\"\n\n\"And where did this happen, if you please, sir?\" asked the man of bills.\n\n\"Somewhere near the old village,\" replied the stranger; \"and, if I am\nrightly informed, on Wednesday last.\"\n\n\"This explains your twa shots, I am thinking, Mrs. Dods,\" said Mr.\nBindloose; \"your groom heard them on the Wednesday--it must have been\nthis attack on the stranger nobleman.\"\n\n\"Maybe it was, and maybe it was not,\" said Mrs. Dods; \"but I'll see gude\nreason before I give up my ain judgment in that case.--I wad like to\nken if this gentleman,\" she added, returning to the subject from which\nMr. Touchwood's interesting conversation had for a few minutes diverted\nher thoughts, \"has heard aught of Mr. Tirl?\"\n\n\"If you mean the person to whom this paper relates,\" said the stranger,\ntaking a printed handbill from his pocket, \"I heard of little else--the\nwhole place rang of him, till I was almost as sick of Tyrrel as William\nRufus was. Some idiotical quarrel which he had engaged in, and which he\nhad not fought out, as their wisdom thought he should have done, was the\nprincipal cause of censure. That is another folly now, which has gained\nground among you. Formerly, two old proud lairds, or cadets of good\nfamily, perhaps, quarrelled, and had a rencontre, or fought a duel after\nthe fashion of their old Gothic ancestors; but men who had no\ngrandfathers never dreamt of such folly--And here the folk denounce a\ntrumpery dauber of canvass, for such I understand to be this hero's\noccupation, as if he were a field-officer, who made valour his\nprofession; and who, if you deprived him of his honour, was like to be\ndeprived of his bread at the same time.--Ha, ha, ha! it reminds one of\nDon Quixote, who took his neighbour, Samson Carrasco, for a\nknight-errant.\"\n\nThe perusal of this paper, which contained the notes formerly laid\nbefore the reader, containing the statement of Sir Bingo, and the\ncensure which the company at the Well had thought fit to pass upon his\naffair with Mr. Tyrrel, induced Mr. Bindloose to say to Mrs. Dods, with\nas little exultation on the superiority of his own judgment as human\nnature would permit,--\n\n\"Ye see now that I was right, Mrs. Dods, and that there was nae earthly\nuse in your fashing yoursell wi' this lang journey--The lad had just\nta'en the bent rather than face Sir Bingo; and troth, I think him the\nwiser of the twa for sae doing--There ye hae print for it.\"\n\nMeg answered somewhat sullenly, \"Ye may be mista'en, for a' that, your\nainsell, for as wise as ye are, Mr. Bindloose; I shall hae that matter\nmair strictly enquired into.\"\n\nThis led to a renewal of the altercation concerning the probable fate of\nTyrrel, in the course of which the stranger was induced to take some\ninterest in the subject.\n\nAt length Mrs. Dods, receiving no countenance from the experienced\nlawyer for the hypothesis she had formed, rose, in something like\ndispleasure, to order her whiskey to be prepared. But hostess as she was\nherself, when in her own dominions, she reckoned without her host in the\npresent instance; for the humpbacked postilion, as absolute in his\ndepartment as Mrs. Dods herself, declared that the cattle would not be\nfit for the road these two hours yet. The good lady was therefore\nobliged to wait his pleasure, bitterly lamenting all the while the loss\nwhich a house of public entertainment was sure to sustain by the absence\nof the landlord or landlady, and anticipating a long list of broken\ndishes, miscalculated reckonings, unarranged chambers, and other\ndisasters, which she was to expect at her return. Mr. Bindloose, zealous\nto recover the regard of his good friend and client, which he had in\nsome degree forfeited by contradicting her on a favourite subject, did\nnot choose to offer the unpleasing, though obvious topic of consolation,\nthat an unfrequented inn is little exposed to the accidents she\napprehended. On the contrary, he condoled with her very cordially, and\nwent so far as to hint, that if Mr. Touchwood had come to Marchthorn\nwith post-horses, as he supposed from his dress, she could have the\nadvantage of them to return with more despatch to St. Ronan's.\n\n\"I am not sure,\" said Mr. Touchwood, suddenly, \"but I may return there\nmyself. In that case I will be glad to set this good lady down, and to\nstay a few days at her house if she will receive me.--I respect a woman\nlike you, ma'am, who pursue the occupation of your father--I have been\nin countries, ma'am, where people have followed the same trade, from\nfather to son, for thousands of years--And I like the fashion--it shows\na steadiness and sobriety of character.\"\n\nMrs. Dods put on a joyous countenance at this proposal, protesting that\nall should be done in her power to make things agreeable; and while her\ngood friend, Mr. Bindloose, expatiated upon the comfort her new guest\nwould experience at the Cleikum, she silently contemplated with delight\nthe prospect of a speedy and dazzling triumph, by carrying off a\ncreditable customer from her showy and successful rival at the Well.\n\n\"I shall be easily accommodated, ma'am,\" said the stranger; \"I have\ntravelled too much and too far to be troublesome. A Spanish venta, a\nPersian khan, or a Turkish caravanserail, is all the same to me--only,\nas I have no servant--indeed, never can be plagued with one of these\nidle loiterers,--I must beg you will send to the Well for a bottle of\nthe water on such mornings as I cannot walk there myself--I find it is\nreally of some service to me.\"\n\nMrs. Dods readily promised compliance with this reasonable request;\ngraciously conceding, that there \"could be nae ill in the water itsell,\nbut maybe some gude--it was only the New Inn, and the daft haverils that\nthey caa'd the Company, that she misliked. Folk had a jest that St.\nRonan dookit the Deevil in the Waal, which garr'd it taste aye since of\nbrimstane--but she dared to say that was a' papist nonsense, for she was\ntell't by him that kend weel, and that was the minister himsell, that\nSt. Ronan was nane of your idolatrous Roman saunts, but a Chaldee,\"\n(meaning probably a Culdee,) \"whilk was doubtless a very different\nstory.\"\n\nMatters being thus arranged to the satisfaction of both parties, the\npost-chaise was ordered, and speedily appeared at the door of Mr.\nBindloose's mansion. It was not without a private feeling of reluctance,\nthat honest Meg mounted the step of a vehicle, on the door of which was\npainted, \"FOX INN AND HOTEL, ST. RONAN'S WELL;\" but it was too late to\nstart such scruples.\n\n\"I never thought to have entered ane o' their hurley-hackets,\" she said,\nas she seated herself; \"and sic a like thing as it is--scarce room for\ntwa folk!--Weel I wot, Mr. Touchwood, when I was in the hiring line, our\ntwa chaises wad hae carried, ilk ane o' them, four grown folk and as\nmony bairns. I trust that doited creature Anthony will come awa back wi'\nmy whiskey and the cattle, as soon as they have had their feed.--Are ye\nsure ye hae room eneugh, sir?--I wad fain hotch mysell farther yont.\"\n\n\"O, ma'am,\" answered the Oriental, \"I am accustomed to all sorts of\nconveyances--a dooly, a litter, a cart, a palanquin, or a post-chaise,\nare all alike to me--I think I could be an inside with Queen Mab in a\nnutshell, rather than not get forward.--Begging you many pardons, if you\nhave no particular objections, I will light my sheroot,\" &c. &c. &c.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[I-20] This was a peculiarity in the countenance of the celebrated Cossack\nleader, Platoff.\n\n[I-21] An epithet which expresses, in Scotland, what the barometer calls\nrainy.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nTHE CLERGYMAN.\n\n    A man he was to all the country dear,\n    And passing rich with forty pounds a-year.\n\nGOLDSMITH'S _Deserted Village_.\n\n\nMrs. Dods's conviction, that her friend Tyrrel had been murdered by the\nsanguinary Captain MacTurk remained firm and unshaken; but some\nresearches for the supposed body having been found fruitless, as well as\nexpensive, she began to give up the matter in despair. \"She had done her\nduty\"--\"she left the matter to them that had a charge anent such\nthings\"--and \"Providence would bring the mystery to light in his own\nfitting time\"--such were the moralities with which the good dame\nconsoled herself; and, with less obstinacy than Mr. Bindloose had\nexpected, she retained her opinion without changing her banker and man\nof business.\n\nPerhaps Meg's acquiescent inactivity in a matter which she had\nthreatened to probe so deeply, was partly owing to the place of poor\nTyrrel being supplied in her blue chamber, and in her daily thoughts and\ncares, by her new guest, Mr. Touchwood; in possessing whom, a deserter\nas he was from the Well, she obtained, according to her view of the\nmatter, a decided triumph over her rivals. It sometimes required,\nhowever, the full force of this reflection, to induce Meg, old and\ncrabbed as she was, to submit to the various caprices and exactions of\nattention which were displayed by her new lodger. Never any man talked\nso much as Touchwood, of his habitual indifference to food, and\naccommodation in travelling; and probably there never was any traveller\nwho gave more trouble in a house of entertainment. He had his own whims\nabout cookery; and when these were contradicted, especially if he felt\nat the same time a twinge of incipient gout, one would have thought he\nhad taken his lessons in the pastry-shop of Bedreddin Hassan, and was\nready to renew the scene of the unhappy cream-tart, which was compounded\nwithout pepper. Every now and then he started some new doctrine in\nculinary matters, which Mrs. Dods deemed a heresy; and then the very\nhouse rang with their disputes. Again, his bed must necessarily be made\nat a certain angle from the pillow to the footposts; and the slightest\ndeviation from this disturbed, he said, his nocturnal rest, and did\ncertainly ruffle his temper. He was equally whimsical about the brushing\nof his clothes, the arrangement of the furniture in his apartment, and a\nthousand minuti\u00c3\u00a6, which, in conversation, he seemed totally to contemn.\n\nIt may seem singular, but such is the inconsistency of human nature,\nthat a guest of this fanciful and capricious disposition gave much more\nsatisfaction to Mrs. Dods, than her quiet and indifferent friend, Mr.\nTyrrel. If her present lodger could blame, he could also applaud; and no\nartist, conscious of such skill as Mrs. Dods possessed, is indifferent\nto the praises of such a connoisseur as Mr. Touchwood. The pride of art\ncomforted her for the additional labour; nor was it a matter unworthy\nof this most honest publican's consideration, that the guests who give\nmost trouble, are usually those who incur the largest bills, and pay\nthem with the best grace. On this point Touchwood was a jewel of a\ncustomer. He never denied himself the gratification of the slightest\nwhim, whatever expense he might himself incur, or whatever trouble he\nmight give to those about him; and all was done under protestation, that\nthe matter in question was the most indifferent thing to him in the\nworld. \"What the devil did he care for Burgess's sauces, he that had eat\nhis kouscousou, spiced with nothing but the sand of the desert? only it\nwas a shame for Mrs. Dods to be without what every decent house, above\nthe rank of an alehouse, ought to be largely provided with.\"\n\nIn short, he fussed, fretted, commanded, and was obeyed; kept the house\nin hot water, and yet was so truly good-natured when essential matters\nwere in discussion, that it was impossible to bear him the least\nill-will; so that Mrs. Dods, though in a moment of spleen she sometimes\nwished him at the top of Tintock,[I-F] always ended by singing forth his\npraises. She could not, indeed, help suspecting that he was a Nabob, as\nwell from his conversation about foreign parts, as from his freaks of\nindulgence to himself, and generosity to others,--attributes which she\nunderstood to be proper to most \"Men of Ind.\" But although the reader\nhas heard her testify a general dislike to this species of Fortune's\nfavourites, Mrs. Dods had sense enough to know, that a Nabob living in\nthe neighbourhood, who raises the price of eggs and poultry upon the\ngood housewives around, was very different from a Nabob residing within\nher own gates, drawing all his supplies from her own larder, and\npaying, without hesitation or question, whatever bills her conscience\npermitted her to send in. In short, to come back to the point at which\nwe perhaps might have stopped some time since, landlady and guest were\nvery much pleased with each other.\n\nBut Ennui finds entrance into every scene, when the gloss of novelty is\nover; and the fiend began to seize upon Mr. Touchwood just when he had\ngot all matters to his mind in the Cleikum Inn--had instructed Dame Dods\nin the mysteries of curry and mullegatawny--drilled the chambermaid into\nthe habit of making his bed at the angle recommended by Sir John\nSinclair--and made some progress in instructing the humpbacked postilion\nin the Arabian mode of grooming. Pamphlets and newspapers, sent from\nLondon and from Edinburgh by loads, proved inadequate to rout this\ninvader of Mr. Touchwood's comfort; and, at last, he bethought himself\nof company. The natural resource would have been the Well--but the\ntraveller had a holy shivering of awe, which crossed him at the very\nrecollection of Lady Penelope, who had worked him rather hard during his\nformer brief residence; and although Lady Binks's beauty might have\ncharmed an Asiatic, by the plump graces of its contour, our senior was\npast the thoughts of a Sultana and a haram. At length a bright idea\ncrossed his mind, and he suddenly demanded of Mrs. Dods, who was pouring\nout his tea for breakfast, into a large cup of a very particular species\nof china, of which he had presented her with a service on condition of\nher rendering him this personal good office,--\"Pray, Mrs. Dods, what\nsort of a man is your minister?\"\n\n\"He's just a man like other men, Maister Touchwood,\" replied Meg; \"what\nsort of a man should he be?\"\n\n\"A man like other men?--ay--that is to say, he has the usual complement\nof legs and arms, eyes and ears--But is he a sensible man?\"\n\n\"No muckle o' that, sir,\" answered Dame Dods; \"for if he was drinking\nthis very tea that ye gat doun from London wi' the mail, he wad mistake\nit for common bohea.\"\n\n\"Then he has not all his organs--wants a nose, or the use of one at\nleast,\" said Mr. Touchwood; \"the tea is right gunpowder--a perfect\nnosegay.\"\n\n\"Aweel, that may be,\" said the landlady; \"but I have gi'en the minister\na dram frae my ain best bottle of real Coniac brandy, and may I never\nstir frae the bit, if he didna commend my whisky when he set down the\nglass! There is no ane o' them in the Presbytery but himsell--ay, or in\nthe Synod either--but wad hae kend whisky frae brandy.\"\n\n\"But what _sort_ of man is he?--Has he learning?\" demanded Touchwood.\n\n\"Learning?--eneugh o' that,\" answered Meg; \"just dung donnart wi'\nlearning--lets a' things about the Manse gang whilk gate they will, sae\nthey dinna plague him upon the score. An awfu' thing it is to see sic an\nill-red-up house!--If I had the twa tawpies that sorn upon the honest\nman ae week under my drilling, I think I wad show them how to sort a\nlodging!\"\n\n\"Does he preach well?\" asked the guest.\n\n\"Oh, weel eneugh, weel eneugh--sometimes he will fling in a lang word or\na bit of learning that our farmers and bannet lairds canna sae weel\nfollow--But what of that, as I am aye telling them?--them that pay\nstipend get aye the mair for their siller.\"\n\n\"Does he attend to his parish?--Is he kind to the poor?\"\n\n\"Ower muckle o' that, Maister Touchwood--I am sure he makes the Word\ngude, and turns not away from those that ask o' him--his very pocket is\npicked by a wheen ne'er-do-weel blackguards, that gae sorning through\nthe country.\"\n\n\"Sorning through the country, Mrs. Dods?--what would you think if you\nhad seen the Fakirs, the Dervises, the Bonzes, the Imaums, the monks,\nand the mendicants, that I have seen?--But go on, never mind--Does this\nminister of yours come much into company?\"\n\n\"Company?--gae wa',\" replied Meg, \"he keeps nae company at a', neither\nin his ain house or ony gate else. He comes down in the morning in a\nlang ragged nightgown, like a potato bogle, and down he sits amang his\nbooks; and if they dinna bring him something to eat, the puir demented\nbody has never the heart to cry for aught, and he has been kend to sit\nfor ten hours thegither, black fasting, whilk is a' mere papistrie,\nthough he does it just out o' forget.\"\n\n\"Why, landlady, in that case, your parson is any thing but the ordinary\nkind of man you described him--Forget his dinner!--the man must be\nmad--he shall dine with me to-day--he shall have such a dinner as I'll\nbe bound he won't forget in a hurry.\"\n\n\"Ye'll maybe find that easier said than dune,\" said Mrs. Dods; \"the\nhonest man hasna, in a sense, the taste of his mouth--forby, he never\ndines out of his ain house--that is, when he dines at a'--A drink of\nmilk and a bit of bread serves his turn, or maybe a cauld potato.--It's\na heathenish fashion of him, for as good a man as he is, for surely\nthere is nae Christian man but loves his own bowels.\"\n\n\"Why, that may be,\" answered Touchwood; \"but I have known many who took\nso much care of their own bowels, my good dame, as to have none for any\none else.--But come--bustle to the work--get us as good a dinner for two\nas you can set out--have it ready at three to an instant--get the old\nhock I had sent me from Cockburn--a bottle of the particular Indian\nSherry--and another of your own old claret--fourth bin, you know,\nMeg.--And stay, he is a priest, and must have port--have all ready, but\ndon't bring the wine into the sun, as that silly fool Beck did the other\nday.--I can't go down to the larder myself, but let us have no\nblunders.\"\n\n\"Nae fear, nae fear,\" said Meg, with a toss of the head, \"I need naebody\nto look into my larder but mysell, I trow--but it's an unco order of\nwine for twa folk, and ane o' them a minister.\"\n\n\"Why, you foolish person, is there not the woman up the village that has\njust brought another fool into the world, and will she not need sack and\ncaudle, if we leave some of our wine?\"\n\n\"A gude ale-posset wad set her better,\" said Meg; \"however, if it's your\nwill, it shall be my pleasure.--But the like of sic a gentleman as\nyoursell never entered my doors!\"\n\nThe traveller was gone before she had completed the sentence; and,\nleaving Meg to bustle and maunder at her leisure, away he marched, with\nthe haste that characterised all his motions when he had any new project\nin his head, to form an acquaintance with the minister of St. Ronan's,\nwhom, while he walks down the street to the Manse, we will endeavour to\nintroduce to the reader.\n\nThe Rev. Josiah Cargill was the son of a small farmer in the south of\nScotland; and a weak constitution, joined to the disposition for study\nwhich frequently accompanies infirm health, induced his parents, though\nat the expense of some sacrifices, to educate him for the ministry. They\nwere the rather led to submit to the privations which were necessary to\nsupport this expense, because they conceived, from their family\ntraditions, that he had in his veins some portion of the blood of that\ncelebrated Boanerges of the Covenant, Donald Cargill,[I-G] who was slain\nby the persecutors at the town of Queensferry, in the melancholy days of\nCharles II., merely because, in the plenitude of his sacerdotal power,\nhe had cast out of the church, and delivered over to Satan by a formal\nexcommunication, the King and Royal Family, with all the ministers and\ncourtiers thereunto belonging. But if Josiah was really derived from\nthis uncompromising champion, the heat of the family spirit which he\nmight have inherited was qualified by the sweetness of his own\ndisposition, and the quiet temper of the times in which he had the good\nfortune to live. He was characterised by all who knew him as a mild,\ngentle, and studious lover of learning, who, in the quiet prosecution of\nhis own sole object, the acquisition of knowledge, and especially of\nthat connected with his profession, had the utmost indulgence for all\nwhose pursuits were different from his own. His sole relaxations were\nthose of a retiring, mild, and pensive temper, and were limited to a\nramble, almost always solitary, among the woods and hills, in praise of\nwhich, he was sometimes guilty of a sonnet, but rather because he could\nnot help the attempt, than as proposing to himself the fame or the\nrewards which attend the successful poet. Indeed, far from seeking to\ninsinuate his fugitive pieces into magazines and newspapers, he blushed\nat his poetical attempts even while alone, and, in fact, was rarely so\nindulgent to his vein as to commit them to paper.\n\nFrom the same maid-like modesty of disposition, our student suppressed a\nstrong natural turn towards drawing, although he was repeatedly\ncomplimented upon the few sketches which he made, by some whose judgment\nwas generally admitted. It was, however, this neglected talent, which,\nlike the swift feet of the stag in the fable, was fated to render him a\nservice which he might in vain have expected from his worth and\nlearning.\n\nMy Lord Bidmore, a distinguished connoisseur, chanced to be in search of\na private tutor for his son and heir, the Honourable Augustus Bidmore,\nand for this purpose had consulted the Professor of Theology, who passed\nbefore him in review several favourite students, any of whom he\nconceived well suited for the situation; but still his answer to the\nimportant and unlooked-for question, \"Did the candidate understand\ndrawing?\" was answered in the negative. The Professor, indeed, added his\nopinion, that such an accomplishment was neither to be desired nor\nexpected in a student of theology; but, pressed hard with this condition\nas a _sine qua non_, he at length did remember a dreaming lad about the\nHall, who seldom could be got to speak above his breath, even when\ndelivering his essays, but was said to have a strong turn for drawing.\nThis was enough for my Lord Bidmore, who contrived to obtain a sight of\nsome of young Cargill's sketches, and was satisfied that, under such a\ntutor, his son could not fail to maintain that character for hereditary\ntaste which his father and grandfather had acquired at the expense of a\nconsiderable estate, the representative value of which was now the\npainted canvass in the great gallery at Bidmore-House.\n\nUpon following up the enquiry concerning the young man's character, he\nwas found to possess all the other necessary qualifications of learning\nand morals, in a greater degree than perhaps Lord Bidmore might have\nrequired; and, to the astonishment of his fellow-students, but more\nespecially to his own, Josiah Cargill was promoted to the desired and\ndesirable situation of private tutor to the Honourable Mr. Bidmore.\n\nMr. Cargill did his duty ably and conscientiously, by a spoiled though\ngood-humoured lad, of weak health and very ordinary parts. He could not,\nindeed, inspire into him any portion of the deep and noble enthusiasm\nwhich characterises the youth of genius; but his pupil made such\nprogress in each branch of his studies as his capacity enabled him to\nattain. He understood the learned languages, and could be very profound\non the subject of various readings--he pursued science, and could class\nshells, pack mosses, and arrange minerals--he drew without taste, but\nwith much accuracy; and although he attained no commanding height in any\npursuit, he knew enough of many studies, literary and scientific, to\nfill up his time, and divert from temptation a head, which was none of\nthe strongest in point of resistance.\n\nMiss Augusta Bidmore, his lordship's only other child, received also the\ninstructions of Cargill in such branches of science as her father chose\nshe should acquire, and her tutor was capable to teach. But her progress\nwas as different from that of her brother, as the fire of heaven differs\nfrom that grosser element which the peasant piles upon his smouldering\nhearth. Her acquirements in Italian and Spanish literature, in history,\nin drawing, and in all elegant learning, were such as to enchant her\nteacher, while at the same time it kept him on the stretch, lest, in her\nsuccessful career, the scholar should outstrip the master.\n\nAlas! such intercourse, fraught as it is with dangers arising out of the\nbest and kindest, as well as the most natural feelings on either side,\nproved in the present, as in many other instances, fatal to the peace of\nthe preceptor. Every feeling heart will excuse a weakness, which we\nshall presently find carried with it its own severe punishment. Cadenus,\nindeed, believe him who will, has assured us, that, in such a perilous\nintercourse, he himself preserved the limits which were unhappily\ntransgressed by the unfortunate Vanessa, his more impassioned pupil:--\n\n    \"The innocent delight he took\n    To see the virgin mind her book,\n    Was but the master's secret joy,\n    In school to hear the finest boy.\"\n\nBut Josiah Cargill was less fortunate, or less cautious. He suffered his\nfair pupil to become inexpressibly dear to him, before he discovered the\nprecipice towards which he was moving under the direction of a blind and\nmisplaced passion. He was indeed utterly incapable of availing himself\nof the opportunities afforded by his situation, to involve his pupil in\nthe toils of a mutual passion. Honour and gratitude alike forbade such a\nline of conduct, even had it been consistent with the natural\nbashfulness, simplicity, and innocence of his disposition. To sigh and\nsuffer in secret, to form resolutions of separating himself from a\nsituation so fraught with danger, and to postpone from day to day the\naccomplishment of a resolution so prudent, was all to which the tutor\nfound himself equal; and it is not improbable, that the veneration with\nwhich he regarded his patron's daughter, with the utter hopelessness of\nthe passion which he nourished, tended to render his love yet more pure\nand disinterested.\n\nAt length, the line of conduct which reason had long since recommended,\ncould no longer be the subject of procrastination. Mr. Bidmore was\ndestined to foreign travel for a twelvemonth, and Mr. Cargill received\nfrom his patron the alternative of accompanying his pupil, or retiring\nupon a suitable provision, the reward of his past instructions. It can\nhardly be doubted which he preferred; for while he was with young\nBidmore, he did not seem entirely separated from his sister. He was sure\nto hear of Augusta frequently, and to see some part, at least, of the\nletters which she was to write to her brother; he might also hope to be\nremembered in these letters as her \"good friend and tutor;\" and to these\nconsolations his quiet, contemplative, and yet enthusiastic disposition,\nclung as to a secret source of pleasure, the only one which life seemed\nto open to him.\n\nBut fate had a blow in store, which he had not anticipated. The chance\nof Augusta's changing her maiden condition for that of a wife, probable\nas her rank, beauty, and fortune rendered such an event, had never once\noccurred to him; and although he had imposed upon himself the unwavering\nbelief that she could never be his, he was inexpressibly affected by the\nintelligence that she had become the property of another.\n\nThe Honourable Mr. Bidmore's letters to his father soon after announced\nthat poor Mr. Cargill had been seized with a nervous fever, and again,\nthat his reconvalescence was attended with so much debility, it seemed\nboth of mind and body, as entirely to destroy his utility as a\ntravelling companion. Shortly after this the travellers separated, and\nCargill returned to his native country alone, indulging upon the road in\na melancholy abstraction of mind, which he had suffered to grow upon him\nsince the mental shock which he had sustained, and which in time became\nthe most characteristical feature of his demeanour. His meditations were\nnot even disturbed by any anxiety about his future subsistence, although\nthe cessation of his employment seemed to render that precarious. For\nthis, however, Lord Bidmore had made provision; for, though a coxcomb\nwhere the fine arts were concerned, he was in other particulars a just\nand honourable man, who felt a sincere pride in having drawn the talents\nof Cargill from obscurity, and entertained due gratitude for the manner\nin which he had achieved the important task intrusted to him in his\nfamily.\n\nHis lordship had privately purchased from the Mowbray family the\npatronage or advowson of the living of St. Ronan's, then held by a very\nold incumbent, who died shortly afterwards; so that upon arriving in\nEngland Cargill found himself named to the vacant living. So\nindifferent, however, did he feel himself towards this preferment, that\nhe might possibly not have taken the trouble to go through the necessary\nsteps previous to his ordination, had it not been on account of his\nmother, now a widow, and unprovided for, unless by the support which he\nafforded her. He visited her in her small retreat in the suburbs of\nMarchthorn, heard her pour out her gratitude to Heaven, that she should\nhave been granted life long enough to witness her son's promotion to a\ncharge, which in her eyes was more honourable and desirable than an\nEpiscopal see--heard her chalk out the life which they were to lead\ntogether in the humble independence which had thus fallen on him--he\nheard all this, and had no power to crush her hopes and her triumph by\nthe indulgence of his own romantic feelings. He passed almost\nmechanically through the usual forms, and was inducted into the living\nof St. Ronan's.\n\nAlthough fanciful and romantic, it was not in Josiah Cargill's nature to\nyield to unavailing melancholy; yet he sought relief, not in society,\nbut in solitary study. His seclusion was the more complete, that his\nmother, whose education had been as much confined as her fortunes, felt\nawkward under her new dignities, and willingly acquiesced in her son's\nsecession from society, and spent her whole time in superintending the\nlittle household, and in her way providing for all emergencies, the\noccurrence of which might call Josiah out of his favourite book-room. As\nold age rendered her inactive, she began to regret the incapacity of her\nson to superintend his own household, and talked something of matrimony,\nand the mysteries of the muckle wheel. To these admonitions Mr. Cargill\nreturned only slight and evasive answers; and when the old lady slept in\nthe village churchyard, at a reverend old age, there was no one to\nperform the office of superintendent in the minister's family. Neither\ndid Josiah Cargill seek for any, but patiently submitted to all the\nevils with which a bachelor estate is attended, and which were at least\nequal to those which beset the renowned Mago-Pico during his state of\ncelibacy.[I-22] His butter was ill churned, and declared by all but\nhimself and the quean who made it, altogether uneatable; his milk was\nburnt in the pan, his fruit and vegetables were stolen, and his black\nstockings mended with blue and white thread.\n\nFor all these things the minister cared not, his mind ever bent upon far\ndifferent matters. Do not let my fair readers do Josiah more than\njustice, or suppose that, like Beltenebros in the desert, he remained\nfor years the victim of an unfortunate and misplaced passion. No--to the\nshame of the male sex be it spoken, that no degree of hopeless love,\nhowever desperate and sincere, can ever continue for years to embitter\nlife. There must be hope--there must be uncertainty--there must be\nreciprocity, to enable the tyrant of the soul to secure a dominion of\nvery long duration over a manly and well-constituted mind, which is\nitself desirous to _will_ its freedom. The memory of Augusta had long\nfaded from Josiah's thoughts, or was remembered only as a pleasing, but\nmelancholy and unsubstantial dream, while he was straining forward in\npursuit of a yet nobler and coyer mistress, in a word, of Knowledge\nherself.\n\nEvery hour that he could spare from his parochial duties, which he\ndischarged with zeal honourable to his heart and head, was devoted to\nhis studies, and spent among his books. But this chase of wisdom, though\nin itself interesting and dignified, was indulged to an excess which\ndiminished the respectability, nay, the utility, of the deceived\nstudent; and he forgot, amid the luxury of deep and dark investigations,\nthat society has its claims, and that the knowledge which is unimparted,\nis necessarily a barren talent, and is lost to society, like the miser's\nconcealed hoard, by the death of the proprietor. His studies were also\nunder the additional disadvantage, that, being pursued for the\ngratification of a desultory longing after knowledge, and directed to no\ndetermined object, they turned on points rather curious than useful, and\nwhile they served for the amusement of the student himself, promised\nlittle utility to mankind at large.\n\nBewildered amid abstruse researches, metaphysical and historical, Mr.\nCargill, living only for himself and his books, acquired many ludicrous\nhabits, which exposed the secluded student to the ridicule of the world,\nand which tinged, though they did not altogether obscure, the natural\ncivility of an amiable disposition, as well as the acquired habits of\npoliteness which he had learned in the good society that frequented Lord\nBidmore's mansion. He not only indulged in neglect of dress and\nappearance, and all those ungainly tricks which men are apt to acquire\nby living very much alone, but besides, and especially, he became\nprobably the most abstracted and absent man of a profession peculiarly\nliable to cherish such habits. No man fell so regularly into the painful\ndilemma of mistaking, or, in Scottish phrase, _miskenning_, the person\nhe spoke to, or more frequently enquired of an old maid for her\nhusband, of a childless wife about her young people, of the distressed\nwidower for the spouse at whose funeral he himself had assisted but a\nfortnight before; and none was ever more familiar with strangers whom he\nhad never seen, or seemed more estranged from those who had a title to\nthink themselves well known to him. The worthy man perpetually\nconfounded sex, age, and calling; and when a blind beggar extended his\nhand for charity, he has been known to return the civility by taking off\nhis hat, making a low bow, and hoping his worship was well.\n\nAmong his brethren, Mr. Cargill alternately commanded respect by the\ndepth of his erudition, and gave occasion to laughter from his odd\npeculiarities. On the latter occasions he used abruptly to withdraw from\nthe ridicule he had provoked; for notwithstanding the general mildness\nof his character, his solitary habits had engendered a testy impatience\nof contradiction, and a keener sense of pain arising from the satire of\nothers, than was natural to his unassuming disposition. As for his\nparishioners, they enjoyed, as may reasonably be supposed, many a hearty\nlaugh at their pastor's expense, and were sometimes, as Mrs. Dods\nhinted, more astonished than edified by his learning; for in pursuing a\npoint of biblical criticism, he did not altogether remember that he was\naddressing a popular and unlearned assembly, not delivering a _concio ad\nclerum_--a mistake, not arising from any conceit of his learning, or\nwish to display it, but from the same absence of mind which induced an\nexcellent divine, when preaching before a party of criminals condemned\nto death, to break off by promising the wretches, who were to suffer\nnext morning, \"the rest of the discourse at the first proper\nopportunity.\" But all the neighbourhood acknowledged Mr. Cargill's\nserious and devout discharge of his ministerial duties; and the poorer\nparishioners forgave his innocent peculiarities, in consideration of his\nunbounded charity; while the heritors, if they ridiculed the\nabstractions of Mr. Cargill on some subjects, had the grace to recollect\nthat they had prevented him from suing an augmentation of stipend,\naccording to the fashion of the clergy around him, or from demanding at\ntheir hands a new manse, or the repair of the old one. He once, indeed,\nwished that they would amend the roof of his book-room, which \"rained\nin\"[I-23] in a very pluvious manner; but receiving no direct answer from\nour friend Meiklewham, who neither relished the proposal nor saw means\nof eluding it, the minister quietly made the necessary repairs at his\nown expense, and gave the heritors no farther trouble on the subject.\n\nSuch was the worthy divine whom our _bon vivant_ at the Cleikum Inn\nhoped to conciliate by a good dinner and Cockburn's particular; an\nexcellent menstruum in most cases, but not likely to be very efficacious\non the present occasion.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[I-22] Note III.--Mago-Pico.\n\n[I-23] _Scottic\u00c3\u00a9_, for \"admitted the rain.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nTHE ACQUAINTANCE.\n\n    'Twixt us thus the difference trims:--\n    Using head instead of limbs,\n      You have read what I have seen;\n    Using limbs instead of head,\n    I have seen what you have read--\n      Which way does the balance lean?\n\nBUTLER.\n\n\nOur traveller, rapid in all his resolutions and motions, strode stoutly\ndown the street, and arrived at the Manse, which was, as we have already\ndescribed it, all but absolutely ruinous. The total desolation and want\nof order about the door, would have argued the place uninhabited, had it\nnot been for two or three miserable tubs with suds, or such like\nsluttish contents, which were left there, that those who broke their\nshins among them might receive a sensible proof, that \"here the hand of\nwoman had been.\" The door being half off its hinges, the entrance was\nfor the time protected by a broken harrow, which must necessarily be\nremoved before entry could be obtained. The little garden, which might\nhave given an air of comfort to the old house had it been kept in any\norder, was abandoned to a desolation, of which that of the sluggard was\nonly a type; and the minister's man, an attendant always proverbial for\ndoing half work, and who seemed in the present instance to do none, was\nseen among docks and nettles, solacing himself with the few gooseberries\nwhich remained on some moss-grown bushes. To him Mr. Touchwood called\nloudly, enquiring after his master; but the clown, conscious of being\ntaken in flagrant delict, as the law says, fled from him like a guilty\nthing, instead of obeying his summons, and was soon heard _hupping_ and\n_geeing_ to the cart, which he had left on the other side of the broken\nwall.\n\nDisappointed in his application to the man-servant, Mr. Touchwood\nknocked with his cane, at first gently, then harder, holloaed, bellowed,\nand shouted, in the hope of calling the attention of some one within\ndoors, but received not a word in reply. At length, thinking that no\ntrespass could be committed upon so forlorn and deserted an\nestablishment, he removed the obstacles to entrance with such a noise as\nhe thought must necessarily have alarmed some one, if there was any live\nperson about the house at all. All was still silent; and, entering a\npassage where the damp walls and broken flags corresponded to the\nappearance of things out of doors, he opened a door to the left, which,\nwonderful to say, still had a latch remaining, and found himself in the\nparlour, and in the presence of the person whom he came to visit.\n\nAmid a heap of books and other literary lumber, which had accumulated\naround him, sat, in his well-worn leathern elbow chair, the learned\nminister of St. Ronan's; a thin, spare man, beyond the middle age, of a\ndark complexion, but with eyes which, though now obscured and vacant,\nhad been once bright, soft, and expressive, and whose features seemed\ninteresting, the rather that, notwithstanding the carelessness of his\ndress, he was in the habit of performing his ablutions with Eastern\nprecision; for he had forgot neatness, but not cleanliness. His hair\nmight have appeared much more disorderly, had it not been thinned by\ntime, and disposed chiefly around the sides of his countenance and the\nback part of his head; black stockings, ungartered, marked his\nprofessional dress, and his feet were thrust into the old slipshod\nshoes, which served him instead of slippers. The rest of his garments,\nas far as visible, consisted in a plaid nightgown wrapt in long folds\nround his stooping and emaciated length of body, and reaching down to\nthe slippers aforesaid. He was so intently engaged in studying the book\nbefore him, a folio of no ordinary bulk, that he totally disregarded the\nnoise which Mr. Touchwood made in entering the room, as well as the\ncoughs and hems with which he thought it proper to announce his\npresence.\n\nNo notice being taken of these inarticulate signals, Mr. Touchwood,\nhowever great an enemy he was to ceremony, saw the necessity of\nintroducing his business, as an apology for his intrusion.\n\n\"Hem! sir--Ha, hem!--You see before you a person in some distress for\nwant of society, who has taken the liberty to call on you as a good\npastor, who may be, in Christian charity, willing to afford him a little\nof your company, since he is tired of his own.\"\n\nOf this speech Mr. Cargill only understood the words \"distress\" and\n\"charity,\" sounds with which he was well acquainted, and which never\nfailed to produce some effect on him. He looked at his visitor with\nlack-lustre eye, and, without correcting the first opinion which he had\nformed, although the stranger's plump and sturdy frame, as well as his\nnicely-brushed coat, glancing cane, and, above all, his upright and\nself-satisfied manner, resembled in no respect the dress, form, or\nbearing of a mendicant, he quietly thrust a shilling into his hand, and\nrelapsed into the studious contemplation which the entrance of Touchwood\nhad interrupted.\n\n\"Upon my word, my good sir,\" said his visitor, surprised at a degree of\nabsence of mind which he could hardly have conceived possible, \"you have\nentirely mistaken my object.\"\n\n\"I am sorry my mite is insufficient, my friend,\" said the clergyman,\nwithout again raising his eyes, \"it is all I have at present to bestow.\"\n\n\"If you will have the kindness to look up for a moment, my good sir,\"\nsaid the traveller, \"you may possibly perceive that you labour under a\nconsiderable mistake.\"\n\nMr. Cargill raised his head, recalled his attention, and, seeing that he\nhad a well-dressed, respectable-looking person before him, he exclaimed\nin much confusion, \"Ha!--yes--on my word, I was so immersed in my\nbook--I believe--I think I have the pleasure to see my worthy friend,\nMr. Lavender?\"\n\n\"No such thing, Mr. Cargill,\" replied Mr Touchwood. \"I will save you the\ntrouble of trying to recollect me--you never saw me before.--But do not\nlet me disturb your studies--I am in no hurry, and my business can wait\nyour leisure.\"\n\n\"I am much obliged,\" said Mr. Cargill; \"have the goodness to take a\nchair, if you can find one--I have a train of thought to recover--a\nslight calculation to finish--and then I am at your command.\"\n\nThe visitor found among the broken furniture, not without difficulty, a\nseat strong enough to support his weight, and sat down, resting upon\nhis cane, and looking attentively at his host, who very soon became\ntotally insensible of his presence. A long pause of total silence\nensued, only disturbed by the rustling leaves of the folio from which\nMr. Cargill seemed to be making extracts, and now and then by a little\nexclamation of surprise and impatience, when he dipped his pen, as\nhappened once or twice, into his snuff-box, instead of the inkstandish\nwhich stood beside it. At length, just as Mr. Touchwood began to think\nthe scene as tedious as it was singular, the abstracted student raised\nhis head, and spoke as if in soliloquy, \"From Acon, Accor, or St. John\nd'Acre, to Jerusalem, how far?\"\n\n\"Twenty-three miles north north-west,\" answered his visitor, without\nhesitation.\n\nMr. Cargill expressed no more surprise at a question which he had put to\nhimself being answered by the voice of another, than if he had found the\ndistance on the map, and indeed, was not probably aware of the medium\nthrough which his question had been solved; and it was the tenor of the\nanswer alone which he attended to in his reply.--\"Twenty-three\nmiles--Ingulphus,\" laying his hand on the volume, \"and Jeffrey Winesauf,\ndo not agree in this.\"\n\n\"They may both be d----d, then, for lying block-heads,\" answered the\ntraveller.\n\n\"You might have contradicted their authority, sir, without using such an\nexpression,\" said the divine, gravely.\n\n\"I cry you mercy, Doctor,\" said Mr. Touchwood; \"but would you compare\nthese parchment fellows with me, that have made my legs my compasses\nover great part of the inhabited world?\"\n\n\"You have been in Palestine, then?\" said Mr. Cargill, drawing himself\nupright in his chair, and speaking with eagerness and with interest.\n\n\"You may swear that, Doctor, and at Acre too. Why, I was there the month\nafter Boney had found it too hard a nut to crack.--I dined with Sir\nSydney's chum, old Djezzar Pacha, and an excellent dinner we had, but\nfor a dessert of noses and ears brought on after the last remove, which\nspoiled my digestion. Old Djezzar thought it so good a joke, that you\nhardly saw a man in Acre whose face was not as flat as the palm of my\nhand--Gad, I respect my olfactory organ, and set off the next morning as\nfast as the most cursed hard-trotting dromedary that ever fell to poor\npilgrim's lot could contrive to tramp.\"\n\n\"If you have really been in the Holy Land, sir,\" said Mr. Cargill, whom\nthe reckless gaiety of Touchwood's manner rendered somewhat suspicious\nof a trick, \"you will be able materially to enlighten me on the subject\nof the Crusades.\"\n\n\"They happened before my time, Doctor,\" replied the traveller.\n\n\"You are to understand that my curiosity refers to the geography of the\ncountries where these events took place,\" answered Mr. Cargill.\n\n\"O! as to that matter, you are lighted on your feet,\" said Mr.\nTouchwood; \"for the time present I can fit you. Turk, Arab, Copt, and\nDruse, I know every one of them, and can make you as well acquainted\nwith them as myself. Without stirring a step beyond your threshold, you\nshall know Syria as well as I do.--But one good turn deserves\nanother--in that case, you must have the goodness to dine with me.\"\n\n\"I go seldom abroad, sir,\" said the minister, with a good deal of\nhesitation, for his habits of solitude and seclusion could not be\nentirely overcome, even by the expectation raised by the traveller's\ndiscourse; \"yet I cannot deny myself the pleasure of waiting on a\ngentleman possessed of so much experience.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" said Mr. Touchwood, \"three be the hour--I never dine later,\nand always to a minute--and the place, the Cleikum Inn, up the way;\nwhere Mrs. Dods is at this moment busy in making ready such a dinner as\nyour learning has seldom seen, Doctor, for I brought the receipts from\nthe four different quarters of the globe.\"\n\nUpon this treaty they parted; and Mr. Cargill, after musing for a short\nwhile upon the singular chance which had sent a living man to answer\nthose doubts for which he was in vain consulting ancient authorities, at\nlength resumed, by degrees, the train of reflection and investigation\nwhich Mr. Touchwood's visit had interrupted, and in a short time lost\nall recollection of his episodical visitor, and of the engagement which\nhe had formed.\n\nNot so Mr. Touchwood, who, when not occupied with business of real\nimportance, had the art, as the reader may have observed, to make a\nprodigious fuss about nothing at all. Upon the present occasion, he\nbustled in and out of the kitchen, till Mrs. Dods lost patience, and\nthreatened to pin the dish-clout to his tail; a menace which he\npardoned, in consideration, that in all the countries which he had\nvisited, which are sufficiently civilized to boast of cooks, these\nartists, toiling in their fiery element, have a privilege to be testy\nand impatient. He therefore retreated from the torrid region of Mrs.\nDods's microcosm, and employed his time in the usual devices of\nloiterers, partly by walking for an appetite, partly by observing the\nprogress of his watch towards three o'clock, when he had happily\nsucceeded in getting an employment more serious. His table, in the blue\nparlour, was displayed with two covers, after the fairest fashion of the\nCleikum Inn; yet the landlady, with a look \"civil but sly,\" contrived to\ninsinuate a doubt whether the clergyman would come, \"when a' was dune.\"\n\nMr. Touchwood scorned to listen to such an insinuation until the fated\nhour arrived, and brought with it no Mr. Cargill. The impatient\nentertainer allowed five minutes for difference of clocks, and variation\nof time, and other five for the procrastination of one who went little\ninto society. But no sooner were the last five minutes expended, than he\ndarted off for the Manse, not, indeed, much like a greyhound or a deer,\nbut with the momentum of a corpulent and well-appetized elderly\ngentleman, who is in haste to secure his dinner. He bounced without\nceremony into the parlour, where he found the worthy divine clothed in\nthe same plaid nightgown, and seated in the very elbow-chair, in which\nhe had left him five hours before. His sudden entrance recalled to Mr.\nCargill, not an accurate, but something of a general, recollection, of\nwhat had passed in the morning, and he hastened to apologize with\n\"Ha!--indeed--already?--upon my word, Mr. A--a--, I mean my dear\nfriend--I am afraid I have used you ill--I forgot to order any\ndinner--but we will do our best.--Eppie--Eppie!\"\n\nNot at the first, second, nor third call, but _ex intervallo_, as the\nlawyers express it, Eppie, a bare-legged, shock-headed, thick-ankled,\nred-armed wench, entered, and announced her presence by an emphatic\n\"What's your wull?\"\n\n\"Have you got any thing in the house for dinner, Eppie?\"\n\n\"Naething but bread and milk, plenty o't--what should I have?\"\n\n\"You see, sir,\" said Mr. Cargill, \"you are like to have a Pythagorean\nentertainment; but you are a traveller, and have doubtless been in your\ntime thankful for bread and milk.\"\n\n\"But never when there was any thing better to be had,\" said Mr.\nTouchwood. \"Come, Doctor, I beg your pardon, but your wits are fairly\ngone a wool-gathering; it was _I_ invited _you_ to dinner, up at the inn\nyonder, and not you me.\"\n\n\"On my word, and so it was,\" said Mr. Cargill; \"I knew I was quite\nright--I knew there was a dinner engagement betwixt us, I was sure of\nthat, and that is the main point.--Come, sir, I wait upon you.\"\n\n\"Will you not first change your dress?\" said the visitor, seeing with\nastonishment that the divine proposed to attend him in his plaid\nnightgown; \"why, we shall have all the boys in the village after us--you\nwill look like an owl in sunshine, and they will flock round you like so\nmany hedge-sparrows.\"\n\n\"I will get my clothes instantly,\" said the worthy clergyman; \"I will\nget ready directly--I am really ashamed to keep you waiting, my dear\nMr.--eh--eh--your name has this instant escaped me.\"\n\n\"It is Touchwood, sir, at your service; I do not believe you ever heard\nit before,\" answered the traveller.\n\n\"True--right--no more I have--well, my good Mr. Touchstone, will you sit\ndown an instant until we see what we can do?--strange slaves we make\nourselves to these bodies of ours, Mr. Touchstone--the clothing and the\nsustaining of them costs us much thought and leisure, which might be\nbetter employed in catering for the wants of our immortal spirits.\"\n\nMr. Touchwood thought in his heart that never had Bramin or Gymnosophist\nless reason to reproach himself with excess in the indulgence of the\ntable, or of the toilet, than the sage before him; but he assented to\nthe doctrine, as he would have done to any minor heresy, rather than\nprotract matters by farther discussing the point at present. In a short\ntime the minister was dressed in his Sunday's suit, without any farther\nmistake than turning one of his black stockings inside out; and Mr.\nTouchwood, happy as was Boswell when he carried off Dr. Johnson in\ntriumph to dine with Strahan and John Wilkes, had the pleasure of\nescorting him to the Cleikum Inn.\n\nIn the course of the afternoon they became more familiar, and the\nfamiliarity led to their forming a considerable estimate of each other's\npowers and acquirements. It is true, the traveller thought the student\ntoo pedantic, too much attached to systems, which, formed in solitude,\nhe was unwilling to renounce, even when contradicted by the voice and\ntestimony of experience; and, moreover, considered his utter inattention\nto the quality of what he eat and drank, as unworthy of a rational, that\nis, of a cooking creature, or of a being who, as defined by Johnson,\nholds his dinner as the most important business of the day. Cargill did\nnot act up to this definition, and was, therefore, in the eyes of his\nnew acquaintance, so far ignorant and uncivilized. What then? He was\nstill a sensible, intelligent man, however abstemious and bookish.\n\nOn the other hand, the divine could not help regarding his new friend as\nsomething of an epicure or belly-god, nor could he observe in him either\nthe perfect education, or the polished bearing, which mark the gentleman\nof rank, and of which, while he mingled with the world, he had become a\ncompetent judge. Neither did it escape him, that in the catalogue of Mr.\nTouchwood's defects, occurred that of many travellers, a slight\ndisposition to exaggerate his own personal adventures, and to prose\nconcerning his own exploits. But then, his acquaintance with Eastern\nmanners, existing now in the same state in which they were found during\nthe time of the Crusades, formed a living commentary on the works of\nWilliam of Tyre, Raymund of Saint Giles, the Moslem annals of\nAbulfaragi, and other historians of the dark period, with which his\nstudies were at present occupied.\n\nA friendship, a companionship at least, was therefore struck up hastily\nbetwixt these two originals; and to the astonishment of the whole parish\nof St. Ronan's, the minister thereof was seen once more leagued and\nunited with an individual of his species, generally called among them\nthe Cleikum Nabob. Their intercourse sometimes consisted in long walks,\nwhich they took in company, traversing, however, as limited a space of\nground, as if it had been actually roped in for their pedestrian\nexercise. Their parade was, according to circumstances, a low haugh at\nthe nether end of the ruinous hamlet, or the esplanade in the front of\nthe old castle; and, in either case, the direct longitude of their\npromenade never exceeded a hundred yards. Sometimes, but rarely, the\ndivine took share of Mr. Touchwood's meal, though less splendidly set\nforth than when he was first invited to partake of it; for, like the\nowner of the gold cup in Parnell's Hermit, when cured of his\nostentation,\n\n    ----\"Still he welcomed, but with less of cost.\"\n\nOn these occasions, the conversation was not of the regular and\ncompacted nature, which passes betwixt men, as they are ordinarily\ntermed, of this world. On the contrary, the one party was often thinking\nof Saladin and Coeur de Lion, when the other was haranguing on Hyder\nAli and Sir Eyre Coote. Still, however, the one spoke, and the other\nseemed to listen; and, perhaps, the lighter intercourse of society,\nwhere amusement is the sole object, can scarcely rest on a safer and\nmore secure basis.\n\nIt was on one of the evenings when the learned divine had taken his\nplace at Mr. Touchwood's social board, or rather at Mrs. Dods's,--for a\ncup of excellent tea, the only luxury which Mr. Cargill continued to\npartake of with some complacence, was the regale before them,--that a\ncard was delivered to the Nabob.\n\n    \"Mr. and Miss Mowbray see company at Shaws-Castle on the twentieth\n    current, at two o'clock--a _d\u00c3\u00a9je\u00c3\u00bbner_--dresses in character\n    admitted--A dramatic picture.\"\n\n\"See company? the more fools they,\" he continued by way of comment. \"See\ncompany?--choice phrases are ever commendable--and this piece of\npasteboard is to intimate that one may go and meet all the fools of the\nparish, if they have a mind--in my time they asked the honour, or the\npleasure, of a stranger's company. I suppose, by and by, we shall have\nin this country the ceremonial of a Bedouin's tent, where every ragged\nHadgi, with his green turban, comes in slap without leave asked, and has\nhis black paw among the rice, with no other apology than Salam\nAlicum.--'Dresses in character--Dramatic picture'--what new tomfoolery\ncan that be?--but it does not signify.--Doctor! I say Doctor!--but he is\nin the seventh heaven--I say, Mother Dods, you who know all the news--Is\nthis the feast that was put off until Miss Mowbray should be better?\"\n\n\"Troth is it, Maister Touchwood--they are no in the way of giving twa\nentertainments in one season--no very wise to gie ane maybe--but they\nken best.\"\n\n\"I say, Doctor, Doctor!--Bless his five wits, he is charging the\nMoslemah with stout King Richard--I say, Doctor, do you know any thing\nof these Mowbrays?\"\n\n\"Nothing extremely particular,\" answered Mr. Cargill, after a pause; \"it\nis an ordinary tale of greatness, which blazes in one century, and is\nextinguished in the next. I think Camden says, that Thomas Mowbray, who\nwas Grand-Marshal of England, succeeded to that high office, as well as\nto the Dukedom of Norfolk, as grandson of Roger Bigot, in 1301.\"\n\n\"Pshaw, man, you are back into the 14th century--I mean these Mowbrays\nof St. Ronan's--now, don't fall asleep again until you have answered my\nquestion--and don't look so like a startled hare--I am speaking no\ntreason.\"\n\nThe clergyman floundered a moment, as is usual with an absent man who is\nrecovering the train of his ideas, or a somnambulist when he is suddenly\nawakened, and then answered, still with hesitation,--\n\n\"Mowbray of St. Ronan's?--ha--eh--I know--that is--I did know the\nfamily.\"\n\n\"Here they are going to give a masquerade, a _bal par\u00c3\u00a9_, private\ntheatricals, I think, and what not,\" handing him the card.\n\n\"I saw something of this a fortnight ago,\" said Mr. Cargill; \"indeed, I\neither had a ticket myself, or I saw such a one as that.\"\n\n\"Are you sure you did not attend the party, Doctor?\" said the Nabob.\n\n\"Who attend? I? you are jesting, Mr. Touchwood.\"\n\n\"But are you quite positive?\" demanded Mr. Touchwood, who had observed,\nto his infinite amusement, that the learned and abstracted scholar was\nso conscious of his own peculiarities, as never to be very sure on any\nsuch subject.\n\n\"Positive!\" he repeated with embarrassment; \"my memory is so wretched\nthat I never like to be positive--but had I done any thing so far out of\nmy usual way, I must have remembered it, one would think--and--I _am_\npositive I was not there.\"\n\n\"Neither could you, Doctor,\" said the Nabob, laughing at the process by\nwhich his friend reasoned himself into confidence, \"for it did not take\nplace--it was adjourned, and this is the second invitation--there will\nbe one for you, as you had a card to the former.--Come, Doctor, you must\ngo--you and I will go together--I as an Imaum--I can say my Bismillah\nwith any Hadgi of them all--You as a cardinal, or what you like best.\"\n\n\"Who, I?--it is unbecoming my station, Mr. Touchwood,\" said the\nclergyman--\"a folly altogether inconsistent with my habits.\"\n\n\"All the better--you shall change your habits.\"\n\n\"You had better gang up and see them, Mr. Cargill,\" said Mrs. Dods; \"for\nit's maybe the last sight ye may see of Miss Mowbray--they say she is to\nbe married and off to England ane of thae odd-come-shortlies, wi' some\nof the gowks about the Waal down-by.\"\n\n\"Married!\" said the clergyman; \"it is impossible!\"\n\n\"But where's the impossibility, Mr. Cargill, when ye see folk marry\nevery day, and buckle them yoursell into the bargain?--Maybe ye think\nthe puir lassie has a bee in her bannet; but ye ken yoursell if naebody\nbut wise folk were to marry, the warld wad be ill peopled. I think it's\nthe wise folk that keep single, like yoursell and me, Mr. Cargill.--Gude\nguide us!--are ye weel?--will ye taste a drap o' something?\"\n\n\"Sniff at my ottar of roses,\" said Mr. Touchwood; \"the scent would\nrevive the dead--why, what in the devil's name is the meaning of\nthis?--you were quite well just now.\"\n\n\"A sudden qualm,\" said Mr. Cargill, recovering himself.\n\n\"Oh! Mr. Cargill,\" said Dame Dods, \"this comes of your lang fasts.\"\n\n\"Right, dame,\" subjoined Mr. Touchwood; \"and of breaking them with sour\nmilk and pease bannock--the least morsel of Christian food is rejected\nby stomach, just as a small gentleman refuses the visit of a creditable\nneighbour, lest he see the nakedness of the land--ha! ha!\"\n\n\"And there is really a talk of Miss Mowbray of St Ronan's being\nmarried?\" said the clergyman.\n\n\"Troth is there,\" said the dame; \"it's Trotting Nelly's news; and though\nshe likes a drappie, I dinna think she would invent a lee or carry\nane--at least to me, that am a gude customer.\"\n\n\"This must be looked to,\" said Mr. Cargill, as if speaking to himself.\n\n\"In troth, and so it should,\" said Dame Dods; \"it's a sin and a shame if\nthey should employ the tinkling cymbal they ca' Chatterly, and sic a\nPresbyterian trumpet as yoursell in the land, Mr. Cargill; and if ye\nwill take a fule's advice, ye winna let the multure be ta'en by your ain\nmill, Mr. Cargill.\"\n\n\"True, true, good Mother Dods,\" said the Nabob; \"gloves and hatbands are\nthings to be looked after, and Mr. Cargill had better go down to this\ncursed festivity with me, in order to see after his own interest.\"\n\n\"I must speak with the young lady,\" said the clergyman, still in a brown\nstudy.\n\n\"Right, right, my boy of black-letter,\" said the Nabob; \"with me you\nshall go, and we'll bring them to submission to mother-church, I warrant\nyou--Why, the idea of being cheated in such a way, would scare a Santon\nout of his trance.--What dress will you wear?\"\n\n\"My own, to be sure,\" said the divine, starting from his reverie.\n\n\"True, thou art right again--they may want to knit the knot on the spot,\nand who would be married by a parson in masquerade?--We go to the\nentertainment though--it is a done thing.\"\n\nThe clergyman assented, provided he should receive an invitation; and as\nthat was found at the Manse, he had no excuse for retracting, even if he\nhad seemed to desire one.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nFORTUNE'S FROLICS.\n\n    _Count Basset._ We gentlemen, whose carriages run on the four aces,\n    are apt to have a wheel out of order.\n\n_The Provoked Husband._\n\n\nOur history must now look a little backwards; and although it is rather\nforeign to our natural style of composition, it must speak more in\nnarrative, and less in dialogue, rather telling what happened, than its\neffects upon the actors. Our purpose, however, is only conditional, for\nwe foresee temptations which may render it difficult for us exactly to\nkeep it.\n\nThe arrival of the young Earl of Etherington at the salutiferous\nfountain of St. Ronan's had produced the strongest sensation;\nespecially, as it was joined with the singular accident of the attempt\nupon his lordship's person, as he took a short cut through the woods on\nfoot, at a distance from his equipage and servants. The gallantry with\nwhich he beat off the highwayman, was only equal to his generosity; for\nhe declined making any researches after the poor devil, although his\nlordship had received a severe wound in the scuffle.\n\nOf the \"three black Graces,\" as they have been termed by one of the most\npleasant companions of our time, Law and Physic hastened to do homage\nto Lord Etherington, represented by Mr. Meiklewham and Dr. Quackleben;\nwhile Divinity, as favourable, though more coy, in the person of the\nReverend Mr. Simon Chatterly, stood on tiptoe to offer any service in\nher power.\n\nFor the honourable reason already assigned, his lordship, after thanking\nMr. Meiklewham, and hinting, that he might have different occasion for\nhis services, declined his offer to search out the delinquent by whom he\nhad been wounded; while to the care of the Doctor he subjected the cure\nof a smart flesh-wound in the arm, together with a slight scratch on the\ntemple; and so very genteel was his behaviour on the occasion, that the\nDoctor, in his anxiety for his safety, enjoined him a month's course of\nthe waters, if he would enjoy the comfort of a complete and perfect\nrecovery. Nothing so frequent, he could assure his lordship, as the\nopening of cicatrized wounds; and the waters of St. Ronan's spring\nbeing, according to Dr. Quackleben, a remedy for all the troubles which\nflesh is heir to, could not fail to equal those of Barege, in\nfacilitating the discharge of all splinters or extraneous matter, which\na bullet may chance to incorporate with the human frame, to its great\nannoyance. For he was wont to say, that although he could not declare\nthe waters which he patronised to be an absolute _panpharmacon_, yet he\nwould with word and pen maintain, that they possessed the principal\nvirtues of the most celebrated medicinal springs in the known world. In\nshort, the love of Alpheus for Arethusa was a mere jest, compared to\nthat which the Doctor entertained for his favourite fountain.\n\nThe new and noble guest, whose arrival so much illustrated these scenes\nof convalescence and of gaiety, was not at first seen so much at the\nordinary, and other places of public resort, as had been the hope of the\nworthy company assembled. His health and his wound proved an excuse for\nmaking his visits to the society few and far between.\n\nBut when he did appear, his manners and person were infinitely\ncaptivating; and even the carnation-coloured silk handkerchief, which\nsuspended his wounded arm, together with the paleness and languor which\nloss of blood had left on his handsome and open countenance, gave a\ngrace to the whole person which many of the ladies declared\nirresistible. All contended for his notice, attracted at once by his\naffability, and piqued by the calm and easy nonchalance with which it\nseemed to be blended. The scheming and selfish Mowbray, the\ncoarse-minded and brutal Sir Bingo, accustomed to consider themselves,\nand to be considered, as the first men of the party, sunk into\ncomparative insignificance. But chiefly Lady Penelope threw out the\ncaptivations of her wit and her literature; while Lady Binks, trusting\nto her natural charms, endeavoured equally to attract his notice. The\nother nymphs of the Spa held a little back, upon the principle of that\npoliteness, which, at continental hunting parties, affords the first\nshot at a fine piece of game, to the person of the highest rank present;\nbut the thought throbbed in many a fair bosom, that their ladyships\nmight miss their aim, in spite of the advantages thus allowed them, and\nthat there might then be room for less exalted, but perhaps not less\nskilful, markswomen, to try their chance.\n\nBut while the Earl thus withdrew from public society, it was necessary,\nat least natural, that he should choose some one with whom to share the\nsolitude of his own apartment; and Mowbray, superior in rank to the\nhalf-pay whisky-drinking Captain MacTurk; in dash to Winterblossom, who\nwas broken down, and turned twaddler; and in tact and sense to Sir Bingo\nBinks, easily manoeuvred himself into his lordship's more intimate\nsociety; and internally thanking the honest footpad, whose bullet had\nbeen the indirect means of secluding his intended victim from all\nsociety but his own, he gradually began to feel the way, and prove the\nstrength of his antagonist, at the various games of skill and hazard\nwhich he introduced, apparently with the sole purpose of relieving the\ntedium of a sick-chamber.\n\nMeiklewham, who felt, or affected, the greatest possible interest in his\npatron's success, and who watched every opportunity to enquire how his\nschemes advanced, received at first such favourable accounts as made him\ngrin from ear to ear, rub his hands, and chuckle forth such bursts of\nglee as only the success of triumphant roguery could have extorted from\nhim. Mowbray looked grave, however, and checked his mirth.\n\n\"There was something in it after all,\" he said, \"that he could not\nperfectly understand. Etherington, an used hand--d----d sharp--up to\nevery thing, and yet he lost his money like a baby.\"\n\n\"And what the matter how he loses it, so you win it like a man?\" said\nhis legal friend and adviser.\n\n\"Why, hang it, I cannot tell,\" replied Mowbray--\"were it not that I\nthink he has scarce the impudence to propose such a thing to succeed,\ncurse me but I should think he was coming the old soldier over me, and\nkeeping up his game.--But no--he can scarce have the impudence to think\nof that.--I find, however, that he has done Wolverine--cleaned out poor\nTom--though Tom wrote to me the precise contrary, yet the truth has\nsince come out--Well, I shall avenge him, for I see his lordship is to\nbe had as well as other folk.\"\n\n\"Weel, Mr. Mowbray,\" said the lawyer, in a tone of affected sympathy,\n\"ye ken your own ways best--but the heavens will bless a moderate mind.\nI would not like to see you ruin this poor lad, _funditus_, that is to\nsay, out and out. To lose some of the ready will do him no great harm,\nand maybe give him a lesson he may be the better of as long as he\nlives--but I wad not, as an honest man, wish you to go deeper--you\nshould spare the lad, Mr. Mowbray.\"\n\n\"Who spared _me_, Meiklewham?\" said Mowbray, with a look and tone of\ndeep emphasis--\"No, no--he must go through the mill--money and money's\nworth.--His seat is called Oakendale--think of that, Mick--Oakendale!\nOh, name of thrice happy augury!--Speak not of mercy, Mick--the\nsquirrels of Oakendale must be dismounted, and learn to go a-foot.--What\nmercy can the wandering lord of Troy expect among the Greeks?--The\nGreeks!--I am a very Suliote--the bravest of Greeks.\n\n    'I think not of pity, I think not of fear,\n    He neither must know who would serve the Vizier.'\n\nAnd necessity, Mick,\" he concluded, with a tone something altered,\n\"necessity is as unrelenting a leader as any Vizier or Pacha, whom\nScanderbeg ever fought with, or Byron has sung.\"\n\nMeiklewham echoed his patron's ejaculation with a sound betwixt a\nwhine, a chuckle, and a groan; the first being designed to express his\npretended pity for the destined victim; the second his sympathy with his\npatron's prospects of success; and the third being a whistle admonitory\nof the dangerous courses through which his object was to be pursued.\n\nSuliote as he boasted himself, Mowbray had, soon after this\nconversation, some reason to admit that,\n\n    \"When Greek meets Greek, then comes the tug of war.\"\n\nThe light skirmishing betwixt the parties was ended, and the serious\nbattle commenced with some caution on either side; each perhaps,\ndesirous of being master of his opponent's system of tactics, before\nexposing his own. Piquet, the most beautiful game at which a man can\nmake sacrifice of his fortune, was one with which Mowbray had, for his\nmisfortune perhaps, been accounted, from an early age, a great\nproficient, and in which the Earl of Etherington, with less experience,\nproved no novice. They now played for such stakes as Mowbray's state of\nfortune rendered considerable to him, though his antagonist appeared not\nto regard the amount. And they played with various success; for, though\nMowbray at times returned with a smile of confidence the enquiring looks\nof his friend Meiklewham, there were other occasions on which he seemed\nto evade them, as if his own had a sad confession to make in reply.\n\nThese alternations, though frequent, did not occupy, after all, many\ndays; for Mowbray, a friend of all hours, spent much of his time in Lord\nEtherington's apartment, and these few days were days of battle. In the\nmeantime, as his lordship was now sufficiently recovered to join the\nParty at Shaws-Castle, and Miss Mowbray's health being announced as\nrestored, that proposal was renewed, with the addition of a dramatic\nentertainment, the nature of which we shall afterwards have occasion to\nexplain. Cards were anew issued to all those who had been formerly\nincluded in the invitation, and of course to Mr. Touchwood, as formerly\na resident at the Well, and now in the neighbourhood; it being\npreviously agreed among the ladies, that a Nabob, though sometimes a\ndingy or damaged commodity, was not to be rashly or unnecessarily\nneglected. As to the parson, he had been asked, of course, as an old\nacquaintance of the Mowbray house, not to be left out when the friends\nof the family were invited on a great scale; but his habits were well\nknown, and it was no more expected that he would leave his manse on such\nan occasion, than that the kirk should loosen itself from its\nfoundations.\n\nIt was after these arrangements had been made, that the Laird of St.\nRonan's suddenly entered Meiklewham's private apartment with looks of\nexultation. The worthy scribe turned his spectacled nose towards his\npatron, and holding in one hand the bunch of papers which he had been\njust perusing, and in the other the tape with which he was about to tie\nthem up again, suspended that operation to await with open eyes and ears\nthe communication of Mowbray.\n\n\"I have done him!\" he said, exultingly, yet in a tone of voice lowered\nalmost to a whisper; \"capotted his lordship for this bout--doubled my\ncapital, Mick, and something more.--Hush, don't interrupt me--we must\nthink of Clara now--she must share the sunshine, should it prove but a\nblink before a storm.--You know, Mick, these two d----d women, Lady\nPenelope and the Binks, have settled that they will have something like\na _bal par\u00c3\u00a9_ on this occasion, a sort of theatrical exhibition, and that\nthose who like it shall be dressed in character.--I know their\nmeaning--they think Clara has no dress fit for such foolery, and so they\nhope to eclipse her; Lady Pen, with her old-fashioned, ill-set diamonds,\nand my Lady Binks, with the new-fashioned finery which she swopt her\ncharacter for. But Clara shan't borne down so, by ----! I got that\naffected slut, Lady Binks's maid, to tell me what her mistress had set\nher mind on, and she is to wear a Grecian habit, forsooth, like one of\nWill Allan's Eastern subjects.--But here's the rub--there is only one\nshawl for sale in Edinburgh that is worth showing off in, and that is at\nthe Gallery of Fashion.--Now, Mick, my friend, that shawl must be had\nfor Clara, with the other trankums of muslin and lace, and so forth,\nwhich you will find marked in the paper there.--Send instantly and\nsecure it, for, as Lady Binks writes by to-morrow's post, your order can\ngo by to-night's mail--There is a note for L.100.\"\n\nFrom a mechanical habit of never refusing any thing, Meiklewham readily\ntook the note, but having looked at it through his spectacles, he\ncontinued to hold it in his hand as he remonstrated with his\npatron.--\"This is a' very kindly meant, St. Ronan's--very kindly meant;\nand I wad be the last to say that Miss Clara does not merit respect and\nkindness at your hand; but I doubt mickle if she wad care a bodle for\nthae braw things. Ye ken yoursell, she seldom alters her fashions. Od,\nshe thinks her riding-habit dress eneugh for ony company; and if you\nwere ganging by good looks, so it is--if she had a thought mair colour,\npoor dear.\"\n\n\"Well, well,\" said Mowbray, impatiently, \"let me alone to reconcile a\nwoman and a fine dress.\"\n\n\"To be sure, ye ken best,\" said the writer; \"but, after a', now, wad it\nno be better to lay by this hundred pound in Tam Turnpenny's, in case\nthe young lady should want it afterhend, just for a sair foot?\"\n\n\"You are a fool, Mick; what signifies healing a sore foot, when there\nwill be a broken heart in the case?--No, no--get the things as I desire\nyou--we will blaze them down for one day at least; perhaps it will be\nthe beginning of a proper dash.\"\n\n\"Weel, weel, I wish it may be so,\" answered Meiklewham; \"but this young\nEarl--hae ye found the weak point?--Can ye get a decerniture against\nhim, with expenses?--that is the question.\"\n\n\"I wish I could answer it,\" said Mowbray, thoughtfully.--\"Confound the\nfellow--he is a cut above me in rank and in society too--belongs to the\ngreat clubs, and is in with the Superlatives and Inaccessibles, and all\nthat sort of folk.--My training has been a peg lower--but, hang it,\nthere are better dogs bred in the kennel than in the parlour. I am up to\nhim, I think--at least I will soon know, Mick, whether I am or no, and\nthat is always one comfort. Never mind--do you execute my commission,\nand take care you name no names--I must save my little Abigail's\nreputation.\"\n\nThey parted, Meiklewham to execute his patron's commission--his patron\nto bring to the test those hopes, the uncertainty of which he could not\ndisguise from his own sagacity.\n\nTrusting to the continuance of his run of luck, Mowbray resolved to\nbring affairs to a crisis that same evening. Every thing seemed in the\noutset to favour his purpose. They had dined together in Lord\nEtherington's apartments--his state of health interfered with the\ncirculation of the bottle, and a drizzly autumnal evening rendered\nwalking disagreeable, even had they gone no farther than the private\nstable where Lord Etherington's horses were kept, under the care of a\ngroom of superior skill. Cards were naturally, almost necessarily,\nresorted to, as the only alternative for helping away the evening, and\npiquet was, as formerly, chosen for the game.\n\nLord Etherington seemed at first indolently careless and indifferent\nabout his play, suffering advantages to escape him, of which, in a more\nattentive state of mind, he could not have failed to avail himself.\nMowbray upbraided him with his inattention, and proposed a deeper stake,\nin order to interest him in the game. The young nobleman complied; and\nin the course of a few hands, the gamesters became both deeply engaged\nin watching and profiting by the changes of fortune. These were so many,\nso varied, and so unexpected, that the very souls of the players seemed\nat length centred in the event of the struggle; and, by dint of doubling\nstakes, the accumulated sum of a thousand pounds and upwards, upon each\nside, came to be staked in the issue of the game.--So large a risk\nincluded all those funds which Mowbray commanded by his sister's\nkindness, and nearly all his previous winnings, so to him the\nalternative was victory or ruin. He could not hide his agitation,\nhowever desirous to do so. He drank wine to supply himself with\ncourage--he drank water to cool his agitation; and at length bent\nhimself to play with as much care and attention as he felt himself\nenabled to command.\n\nIn the first part of the game their luck appeared tolerably equal, and\nthe play of both befitting gamesters who had dared to place such a sum\non the cast. But, as it drew towards a conclusion, fortune altogether\ndeserted him who stood most in need of her favour, and Mowbray, with\nsilent despair, saw his fate depend on a single trick, and that with\nevery odds against him, for Lord Etherington was elder hand. But how can\nfortune's favour secure any one who is not true to himself?--By an\ninfraction of the laws of the game, which could only have been expected\nfrom the veriest bungler that ever touched a card, Lord Etherington\ncalled a point without showing it, and, by the ordinary rule, Mowbray\nwas entitled to count his own--and in the course of that and the next\nhand, gained the game and swept the stakes. Lord Etherington showed\nchagrin and displeasure, and seemed to think that the rigour of the game\nhad been more insisted upon than in courtesy it ought to have been, when\nmen were playing for so small a stake. Mowbray did not understand this\nlogic. A thousand pounds, he said, were in his eyes no nutshells; the\nrules of piquet were insisted on by all but boys and women; and for his\npart, he had rather not play at all than not play the game.\n\n\"So it would seem, my dear Mowbray,\" said the Earl; \"for on my soul, I\nnever saw so disconsolate a visage as thine during that unlucky\ngame--it withdrew all my attention from my hand; and I may safely say,\nyour rueful countenance has stood me in a thousand pounds. If I could\ntransfer thy long visage to canvass, I should have both my revenge and\nmy money; for a correct resemblance would be worth not a penny less than\nthe original has cost me.\"\n\n\"You are welcome to your jest, my lord,\" said Mowbray, \"it has been well\npaid for; and I will serve you in ten thousand at the same rate. What\nsay you?\" he proceeded, taking up and shuffling the cards, \"will you do\nyourself more justice in another game?--Revenge, they say, is sweet.\"\n\n\"I have no appetite for it this evening,\" said the Earl, gravely; \"if I\nhad, Mowbray, you might come by the worse. I do not _always_ call a\npoint without showing it.\"\n\n\"Your lordship is out of humour with yourself for a blunder that might\nhappen to any man--it was as much my good luck as a good hand would have\nbeen, and so fortune be praised.\"\n\n\"But what if with this Fortune had nought to do?\" replied Lord\nEtherington.--\"What if, sitting down with an honest fellow and a friend\nlike yourself, Mowbray, a man should rather choose to lose his own\nmoney, which he could afford, than to win what it might distress his\nfriend to part with?\"\n\n\"Supposing a case so far out of supposition, my lord,\" answered Mowbray,\nwho felt the question ticklish--\"for, with submission, the allegation is\neasily made, and is totally incapable of proof--I should say, no one had\na right to think for me in such a particular, or to suppose that I\nplayed for a higher stake than was convenient.\"\n\n\"And thus your friend, poor devil,\" replied Lord Etherington, \"would\nlose his money, and run the risk of a quarrel into the boot!--We will\ntry it another way--Suppose this good-humoured and simple-minded\ngamester had a favour of the deepest import to ask of his friend, and\njudged it better to prefer his request to a winner than to a loser?\"\n\n\"If this applies to me, my lord,\" replied Mowbray, \"it is necessary I\nshould learn how I can oblige your lordship.\"\n\n\"That is a word soon spoken, but so difficult to be recalled, that I am\nalmost tempted to pause--but yet it must be said.--Mowbray, you have a\nsister.\"\n\nMowbray started.--\"I have indeed a sister, my lord; but I can conceive\nno case in which her name can enter with propriety into our present\ndiscussion.\"\n\n\"Again in the menacing mood!\" said Lord Etherington, in his former tone;\n\"now, here is a pretty fellow--he would first cut my throat for having\nwon a thousand pounds from me, and then for offering to make his sister\na countess!\"\n\n\"A countess, my lord?\" said Mowbray; \"you are but jesting--you have\nnever even seen Clara Mowbray.\"\n\n\"Perhaps not--but what then?--I may have seen her picture, as Puff says\nin the Critic, or fallen in love with her from rumour--or, to save\nfarther suppositions, as I see they render you impatient, I may be\nsatisfied with knowing that she is a beautiful and accomplished young\nlady, with a large fortune.\"\n\n\"What fortune do you mean, my lord?\" said Mowbray, recollecting with\nalarm some claims, which, according to Meiklewham's view of the\nsubject, his sister might form upon his property.--\"What estate?--there\nis nothing belongs to our family, save these lands of St. Ronan's, or\nwhat is left of them; and of these I am, my lord, an undoubted heir of\nentail in possession.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" said the Earl, \"for I have no claim on your mountain realms\nhere, which are, doubtless,\n\n    ----'renown'd of old\n    For knights, and squires, and barons bold;'\n\nmy views respect a much richer, though less romantic domain--a large\nmanor, hight Nettlewood. House old, but standing in the midst of such\nglorious oaks--three thousand acres of land, arable, pasture, and\nwoodland, exclusive of the two closes, occupied by Widow Hodge and\nGoodman Trampclod--manorial rights--mines and minerals--and the devil\nknows how many good things besides, all lying in the vale of Bever.\"\n\n\"And what has my sister to do with all this?\" asked Mowbray, in great\nsurprise.\n\n\"Nothing; but that it belongs to her when she becomes Countess of\nEtherington.\"\n\n\"It is, then, your lordship's property already?\"\n\n\"No, by Jove! nor can it, unless your sister honours me with her\napprobation of my suit,\" replied the Earl.\n\n\"This is a sorer puzzle than one of Lady Penelope's charades, my lord,\"\nsaid Mr. Mowbray; \"I must call in the assistance of the Reverend Mr.\nChatterly.\"\n\n\"You shall not need,\" said Lord Etherington; \"I will give you the key,\nbut listen to me with patience.--You know that we nobles of England,\nless jealous of our sixteen quarters than those on the continent, do\nnot take scorn to line our decayed ermines with the little cloth of gold\nfrom the city; and my grandfather was lucky enough to get a wealthy\nwife, with a halting pedigree,--rather a singular circumstance,\nconsidering that her father was a countryman of yours. She had a\nbrother, however, still more wealthy than herself, and who increased his\nfortune by continuing to carry on the trade which had first enriched his\nfamily. At length he summed up his books, washed his hands of commerce,\nand retired to Nettlewood, to become a gentleman; and here my much\nrespected grand-uncle was seized with the rage of making himself a man\nof consequence. He tried what marrying a woman of family would do; but\nhe soon found that whatever advantage his family might derive from his\ndoing so, his own condition was but little illustrated. He next resolved\nto become a man of family himself. His father had left Scotland when\nvery young, and bore, I blush to say, the vulgar name of Scrogie. This\nhapless dissyllable my uncle carried in person to the herald office in\nScotland; but neither Lyon, nor Marchmont, nor Islay, nor Snadoun,\nneither herald nor pursuivant, would patronise Scrogie.--Scrogie!--there\ncould nothing be made out of it--so that my worthy relative had recourse\nto the surer side of the house, and began to found his dignity on his\nmother's name of Mowbray. In this he was much more successful, and I\nbelieve some sly fellow stole for him a slip from your own family tree,\nMr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's, which, I daresay, you have never missed. At\nany rate, for his _argent_ and _or_, he got a handsome piece of\nparchment, blazoned with a white lion for Mowbray, to be borne\nquarterly, with three stunted or scrog-bushes for Scrogie, and became\nthenceforth Mr. Scrogie Mowbray, or rather, as he subscribed himself,\nReginald (his former Christian name was Ronald) S. Mowbray. He had a son\nwho most undutifully laughed at all this, refused the honours of the\nhigh name of Mowbray, and insisted on retaining his father's original\nappellative of Scrogie, to the great annoyance of his said father's\nears, and damage of his temper.\"\n\n\"Why, faith, betwixt the two,\" said Mowbray, \"I own I should have\npreferred my own name, and I think the old gentleman's taste rather\nbetter than the young one's.\"\n\n\"True; but both were wilful, absurd originals, with a happy obstinacy of\ntemper, whether derived from Mowbray or Scrogie I know not, but which\nled them so often into opposition, that the offended father, Reginald S.\nMowbray, turned his recusant son Scrogie fairly out of doors; and the\nfellow would have paid for his plebeian spirit with a vengeance, had he\nnot found refuge with a surviving partner of the original Scrogie of\nall, who still carried on the lucrative branch of traffic by which the\nfamily had been first enriched. I mention these particulars to account,\nin so far as I can, for the singular predicament in which I now find\nmyself placed.\"\n\n\"Proceed, my lord,\" said Mr. Mowbray; \"there is no denying the\nsingularity of your story, and I presume you are quite serious in giving\nme such an extraordinary detail.\"\n\n\"Entirely so, upon my honour--and a most serious matter it is, you will\npresently find. When my worthy uncle, Mr. S. Mowbray, (for I will not\ncall him Scrogie even in the grave,) paid his debt to nature, every\nbody concluded he would be found to have disinherited his son, the\nunfilial Scrogie, and so far every body was right--But it was also\ngenerally believed that he would settle the estate on my father, Lord\nEtherington, the son of his sister, and therein every one was wrong. For\nmy excellent grand-uncle had pondered with himself, that the favoured\nname of Mowbray would take no advantage, and attain no additional\nelevation, if his estate of Nettlewood (otherwise called Mowbray-Park)\nshould descend to our family without any condition; and with the\nassistance of a sharp attorney, he settled it on me, then a schoolboy,\n_on condition_ that I should, before attaining the age of twenty-five\ncomplete, take unto myself in holy wedlock a young lady of good fame, of\nthe name of Mowbray, and, by preference, of the house of St. Ronan's,\nshould a damsel of that house exist.--Now my riddle is read.\"\n\n\"And a very extraordinary one it is,\" replied Mowbray, thoughtfully.\n\n\"Confess the truth,\" said Lord Etherington, laying his hand on his\nshoulder; \"you think the story will bear a grain of a scruple of doubt,\nif not a whole scruple itself?\"\n\n\"At least, my lord,\" answered Mowbray, \"your lordship will allow, that,\nbeing Miss Mowbray's only near relation, and sole guardian, I may,\nwithout offence, pause upon a suit for her hand, made under such odd\ncircumstances.\"\n\n\"If you have the least doubt either respecting my rank or fortune, I can\ngive, of course, the most satisfactory references,\" said the Earl of\nEtherington.\n\n\"That I can easily believe, my lord,\" said Mowbray; \"nor do I in the\nleast fear deception, where detection would be so easy. Your lordship's\nproceedings towards me, too,\" (with a conscious glance at the bills he\nstill held in his hand,) \"have, I admit, been such as to intimate some\nsuch deep cause of interest as you have been pleased to state. But it\nseems strange that your lordship should have permitted years to glide\naway, without so much as enquiring after the young lady, who, I believe,\nis the only person qualified as your grand-uncle's will requires, with\nwhom you can form an alliance. It appears to me, that long before now,\nthis matter ought to have been investigated; and that, even now, it\nwould have been more natural and more decorous to have at least seen my\nsister before proposing for her hand.\"\n\n\"On the first point, my dear Mowbray,\" said Lord Etherington, \"I am free\nto own to you, that, without meaning your sister the least affront, I\nwould have got rid of this clause if I could; for every man would fain\nchoose a wife for himself, and I feel no hurry to marry at all. But the\nrogue-lawyers, after taking fees, and keeping me in hand for years, have\nat length roundly told me the clause must be complied with, or\nNettlewood must have another master. So I thought it best to come down\nhere in person, in order to address the fair lady; but as accident has\nhitherto prevented my seeing her, and as I found in her brother a man\nwho understands the world, I hope you will not think the worse of me,\nthat I have endeavoured in the outset to make you my friend. Truth is, I\nshall be twenty-five in the course of a month; and without your favour,\nand the opportunities which only you can afford me, that seems a short\ntime to woo and win a lady of Miss Mowbray's merit.\"\n\n\"And what is the alternative if you do not form this proposed alliance,\nmy lord?\" said Mowbray.\n\n\"The bequest of my grand-uncle lapses,\" said the Earl, \"and fair\nNettlewood, with its old house, and older oaks, manorial rights, Hodge\nTrampclod, and all, devolves on a certain cousin-german of mine, whom\nHeaven of his mercy confound!\"\n\n\"You have left yourself little time to prevent such an event, my lord,\"\nsaid Mowbray; \"but things being as I now see them, you shall have what\ninterest I can give you in the affair.--We must stand, however, on more\nequal terms, my lord--I will condescend so far as to allow it would have\nbeen inconvenient for me at this moment to have lost that game, but I\ncannot in the circumstances think of acting as if I had fairly won it.\nWe must draw stakes, my lord.\"\n\n\"Not a word of that, if you really mean me kindly, my dear Mowbray. The\nblunder was a real one, for I was indeed thinking, as you may suppose,\non other things than the showing my point--All was fairly lost and\nwon.--I hope I shall have opportunities of offering real services, which\nmay perhaps give me some right to your partial regard--at present we are\non equal footing on all sides--perfectly so.\"\n\n\"If your lordship thinks so,\" said Mowbray,--and then passing rapidly to\nwhat he felt he could say with more confidence,--\"Indeed, at any rate,\nno personal obligation to myself could prevent my doing my full duty as\nguardian to my sister.\"\n\n\"Unquestionably, I desire nothing else,\" replied the Earl of\nEtherington.\n\n\"I must therefore understand that your lordship is quite serious in your\nproposal; and that it is not to be withdrawn, even if upon acquaintance\nwith Miss Mowbray, you should not perhaps think her so deserving of your\nlordship's attentions, as report may have spoken her.\"\n\n\"Mr. Mowbray,\" replied the Earl, \"the treaty between you and me shall be\nas definite as if I were a sovereign prince, demanding in marriage the\nsister of a neighbouring monarch, whom, according to royal etiquette, he\nneither has seen nor could see. I have been quite frank with you, and I\nhave stated to you that my present motives for entering upon negotiation\nare not personal, but territorial; when I know Miss Mowbray, I have no\ndoubt they will be otherwise. I have heard she is beautiful.\"\n\n\"Something of the palest, my lord,\" answered Mowbray.\n\n\"A fine complexion is the first attraction which is lost in the world of\nfashion, and that which it is easiest to replace.\"\n\n\"Dispositions, my lord, may differ,\" said Mowbray, \"without faults on\neither side. I presume your lordship has enquired into my sister's. She\nis amiable, accomplished, sensible, and high-spirited; but yet\"----\n\n\"I understand you, Mr. Mowbray, and will spare you the pain of speaking\nout. I have heard Miss Mowbray is in some respects--particular; to use a\nbroader word--a little whimsical.--No matter. She will have the less to\nlearn when she becomes a countess, and a woman of fashion.\"\n\n\"Are you serious, my lord?\" said Mowbray.\n\n\"I am--and I will speak my mind still more plainly. I have good temper,\nand excellent spirits, and can endure a good deal of singularity in\nthose I live with. I have no doubt your sister and I will live happily\ntogether--But in case it should prove otherwise, arrangements may be\nmade previously, which will enable us in certain circumstances to live\nhappily apart. My own estate is large, and Nettlewood will bear\ndividing.\"\n\n\"Nay, then,\" said Mowbray, \"I have little more to say--nothing indeed\nremains for enquiry, so far as your lordship is concerned. But my sister\nmust have free liberty of choice--so far as I am concerned, your\nlordship's suit has my interest.\"\n\n\"And I trust we may consider it as a done thing?\"\n\n\"With Clara's approbation--certainly,\" answered Mowbray.\n\n\"I trust there is no chance of personal repugnance on the young lady's\npart?\" said the young peer.\n\n\"I anticipate nothing of the kind, my lord,\" answered Mowbray, \"as I\npresume there is no reason for any; but young ladies will be capricious,\nand if Clara, after I have done and said all that a brother ought to do,\nshould remain repugnant, there is a point in the exertion of my\ninfluence which it would be cruelty to pass.\"\n\nThe Earl of Etherington walked a turn through the apartment, then\npaused, and said, in a grave and doubtful tone, \"In the meanwhile, I am\nbound, and the young lady is free, Mowbray. Is this quite fair?\"\n\n\"It is what happens in every case, my lord, where a gentleman proposes\nfor a lady,\" answered Mowbray; \"he must remain, of course, bound by his\noffer, until, within a reasonable time, it is accepted or rejected. It\nis not my fault that your lordship has declared your wishes to me,\nbefore ascertaining Clara's inclination. But while as yet the matter is\nbetween ourselves--I make you welcome to draw back if you think proper.\nClara Mowbray needs not push for a catch-match.\"\n\n\"Nor do I desire,\" said the young nobleman, \"any time to reconsider the\nresolution which I have confided to you. I am not in the least fearful\nthat I shall change my mind on seeing your sister, and I am ready to\nstand by the proposal which I have made to you.--If, however, you feel\nso extremely delicately on my account,\" he continued, \"I can see and\neven converse with Miss Mowbray at this f\u00c3\u00aate of yours, without the\nnecessity of being at all presented to her--The character which I have\nassumed in a manner obliges me to wear a mask.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said the Laird of St. Ronan's, \"and I am glad, for both our\nsakes, your lordship thinks of taking a little law upon this occasion.\"\n\n\"I shall profit nothing by it,\" said the Earl; \"my doom is fixed before\nI start--but if this mode of managing the matter will save your\nconscience, I have no objection to it--it cannot consume much time,\nwhich is what I have to look to.\"\n\nThey then shook hands and parted, without any farther discourse which\ncould interest the reader.\n\nMowbray was glad to find himself alone, in order to think over what had\nhappened, and to ascertain the state of his own mind, which at present\nwas puzzling even to himself. He could not but feel that much greater\nadvantages of every kind might accrue to himself and his family from the\nalliance of the wealthy young Earl, than could have been derived from\nany share of his spoils which he had proposed to gain by superior\naddress in play, or greater skill on the turf. But his pride was hurt\nwhen he recollected that he had placed himself entirely in Lord\nEtherington's power; and the escape from absolute ruin which he had\nmade, solely by the sufferance of his opponent, had nothing in it\nconsolatory to his wounded feelings. He was lowered in his own eyes,\nwhen he recollected how completely the proposed victim of his ingenuity\nhad seen through his schemes, and only abstained from baffling them\nentirely, because to do so suited best with his own. There was a shade\nof suspicion, too, which he could not entirely eradicate from his\nmind.--What occasion had this young nobleman to preface, by the\nvoluntary loss of a brace of thousands, a proposal which must have been\nacceptable in itself, without any such sacrifice? And why should he,\nafter all, have been so eager to secure his accession to the proposed\nalliance, before he had even seen the lady who was the object of it?\nHowever hurried for time, he might have waited the event at least of the\nentertainment at Shaws-Castle, at which Clara was necessarily obliged to\nmake her appearance.--Yet such conduct, however unusual, was equally\ninconsistent with any sinister intentions; since the sacrifice of a\nlarge sum of money, and the declaration of his views upon a portionless\nyoung lady of family, could scarcely be the preface to any unfair\npractice. So that, upon the whole, Mowbray settled, that what was\nuncommon in the Earl's conduct arose from the hasty and eager\ndisposition of a rich young Englishman, to whom money is of little\nconsequence, and who is too headlong in pursuit of the favourite plan of\nthe moment, to proceed in the most rational or most ordinary manner. If,\nhowever, there should prove any thing farther in the matter than he\ncould at present discover, Mowbray promised himself that the utmost\ncircumspection on his part could not fail to discover it, and that in\nfull time to prevent any ill consequences to his sister or himself.\n\nImmersed in such cogitations, he avoided the inquisitive presence of Mr.\nMeiklewham, who, as usual, had been watching for him to learn how\nmatters were going on; and although it was now late, he mounted his\nhorse, and rode hastily to Shaws-Castle. On the way, he deliberated with\nhimself whether to mention to his sister the application which had been\nmade to him, in order to prepare her to receive the young Earl as a\nsuitor, favoured with her brother's approbation. \"But no, no, no;\" such\nwas the result of his contemplation. \"She might take it into her head\nthat his thoughts were bent less upon having her for a countess, than on\nobtaining possession of his grand-uncle's estate.--We must keep quiet,\"\nconcluded he, \"until her personal appearance and accomplishments may\nappear at least to have some influence upon his choice.--We must say\nnothing till this blessed entertainment has been given and received.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nA LETTER.\n\n    \"Has he so long held out with me untired,\n    And stops he now for breath?--Well--Be it so.\"\n\n_Richard III._\n\n\nMowbray had no sooner left the Earl's apartment, than the latter\ncommenced an epistle to a friend and associate, which we lay before the\nreader, as best calculated to illustrate the views and motives of the\nwriter. It was addressed to Captain Jekyl, of the ---- regiment of\nGuards, at the Green Dragon, Harrowgate, and was of the following\ntenor:--\n\n    \"Dear Harry,\n\n    \"I have expected you here these ten days past, anxiously as ever man\n    was looked for; and have now to charge your absence as high treason\n    to your sworn allegiance. Surely you do not presume, like one of\n    Napoleon's new-made monarchs, to grumble for independence, as if\n    your greatness were of your own making, or as if I had picked you\n    out of the whole of St. James's coffee-house to hold my back-hand,\n    for your sake, forsooth, not for my own? Wherefore, lay aside all\n    your own proper business, be it the pursuit of dowagers, or the\n    plucking of pigeons, and instantly repair to this place, where I may\n    speedily want your assistance.--_May_ want it, said I? Why, most\n    negligent of friends and allies, I _have_ wanted it already, and\n    that when it might have done me yeoman's service. Know that I have\n    had an affair since I came hither--have got hurt myself, and have\n    nearly shot my friend; and if I had, I might have been hanged for\n    it, for want of Harry Jekyl to bear witness in my favour. I was so\n    far on my road to this place, when, not choosing, for certain\n    reasons, to pass through the old village, I struck by a footpath\n    into the woods which separate it from the new Spa, leaving my\n    carriage and people to go the carriage-way. I had not walked half a\n    mile when I heard the footsteps of some one behind, and, looking\n    round, what should I behold but the face in the world which I most\n    cordially hate and abhor--I mean that which stands on the shoulders\n    of my right trusty and well-beloved cousin and counsellor, Saint\n    Francis. He seemed as much confounded as I was at our unexpected\n    meeting; and it was a minute ere he found breath to demand what I\n    did in Scotland, contrary to my promise, as he was pleased to\n    express it.--I retaliated, and charged him with being here, in\n    contradiction to his.--He justified, and said he had only come down\n    upon the express information that I was upon my road to St.\n    Ronan's.--Now, Harry, how the devil should he have known this hadst\n    thou been quite faithful? for I am sure, to no ear but thine own did\n    I breathe a whisper of my purpose.--Next, with the insolent\n    assumption of superiority, which he founds on what he calls the\n    rectitude of his purpose, he proposed we should both withdraw from a\n    neighbourhood into which we could bring nothing but wretchedness.--I\n    have told you how difficult it is to cope with the calm and resolute\n    manner that the devil gifts him with on such occasions; but I was\n    determined he should not carry the day this time. I saw no chance\n    for it, however, but to put myself into a towering passion, which,\n    thank Heaven, I can always do on short notice.--I charged him with\n    having imposed formerly on my youth, and made himself judge of my\n    rights; and I accompanied my defiance with the strongest terms of\n    irony and contempt, as well as with demand of instant satisfaction.\n    I had my travelling pistols with me, (_et pour cause_,) and, to my\n    surprise, my gentleman was equally provided.--For fair play's sake,\n    I made him take one of my pistols--right Kuchenritters--a brace of\n    balls in each, but that circumstance I forgot.--I would fain have\n    argued the matter a little longer; but I thought at the time, and\n    think still, that the best arguments which he and I can exchange,\n    must come from the point of the sword, or the muzzle of the\n    pistol.--We fired nearly together, and I think both dropped--I am\n    sure I did, but recovered in a minute, with a damaged arm and a\n    scratch on the temple--it was the last which stunned me--so much for\n    double-loaded pistols.--My friend was invisible, and I had nothing\n    for it but to walk to the Spa, bleeding all the way like a calf, and\n    tell a raw-head-and-bloody-bone story about a footpad, which, but\n    for my earldom, and my gory locks, no living soul would have\n    believed.\n\n    \"Shortly after, when I had been installed in a sick room, I had the\n    mortification to learn, that my own impatience had brought all this\n    mischief upon me, at a moment when I had every chance of getting rid\n    of my friend without trouble, had I but let him go on his own\n    errand; for it seems he had an appointment that morning with a booby\n    Baronet, who is said to be a bullet-slitter, and would perhaps have\n    rid me of Saint Francis without any trouble or risk on my part.\n    Meantime, his non-appearance at this rendezvous has placed Master\n    Francis Tyrrel, as he chooses to call himself, in the worst odour\n    possible with the gentry at the Spring, who have denounced him as a\n    coward and no gentleman.--What to think of the business myself, I\n    know not; and I much want your assistance to see what can have\n    become of this fellow, who, like a spectre of ill omen, has so often\n    thwarted and baffled my best plans. My own confinement renders me\n    inactive, though my wound is fast healing. Dead he cannot be; for,\n    had he been mortally wounded, we should have heard of him somewhere\n    or other--he could not have vanished from the earth like a bubble of\n    the elements. Well and sound he cannot be; for, besides that I am\n    sure I saw him stagger and drop, firing his pistol as he fell, I\n    know him well enough to swear, that, had he not been severely\n    wounded, he would have first pestered me with his accursed presence\n    and assistance, and then walked forward with his usual composure to\n    settle matters with Sir Bingo Binks. No--no--Saint Francis is none\n    of those who leave such jobs half finished--it is but doing him\n    justice to say, he has the devil's courage to back his own\n    deliberate impertinence. But then, if wounded severely, he must be\n    still in this neighbourhood, and probably in concealment--this is\n    what I must discover, and I want your assistance in my enquiries\n    among the natives.--Haste hither, Harry, as ever you look for good\n    at my hand.\n\n    \"A good player, Harry, always studies to make the best of bad\n    cards--and so I have endeavoured to turn my wound to some account;\n    and it has given me the opportunity to secure Monsieur le Frere in\n    my interests. You say very truly, that it is of consequence to me to\n    know the character of this new actor on the disordered scene of my\n    adventures.--Know, then, he is that most incongruous of all\n    monsters--a Scotch Buck--how far from being buck of the season you\n    may easily judge. Every point of national character is opposed to\n    the pretensions of this luckless race, when they attempt to take on\n    them a personage which is assumed with so much facility by their\n    brethren of the Isle of Saints. They are a shrewd people, indeed,\n    but so destitute of ease, grace, pliability of manners, and\n    insinuation of address, that they eternally seem to suffer actual\n    misery in their attempts to look gay and careless. Then their pride\n    heads them back at one turn, their poverty at another, their\n    pedantry at a third, their _mauvaise honte_ at a fourth; and with\n    so many obstacles to make them bolt off the course, it is positively\n    impossible they should win the plate. No, Harry, it is the grave\n    folk in Old England who have to fear a Caledonian invasion--they\n    will make no conquests in the world of fashion. Excellent bankers\n    the Scots may be, for they are eternally calculating how to add\n    interest to principal;--good soldiers, for they are, if not such\n    heroes as they would be thought, as brave, I suppose, as their\n    neighbours, and much more amenable to discipline;--lawyers they are\n    born; indeed every country gentleman is bred one, and their patient\n    and crafty disposition enables them, in other lines, to submit to\n    hardships which other natives could not bear, and avail themselves\n    of advantages which others would let pass under their noses\n    unavailingly. But assuredly Heaven did not form the Caledonian for\n    the gay world; and his efforts at ease, grace, and gaiety, resemble\n    only the clumsy gambols of the ass in the fable. Yet the Scot has\n    his sphere too, (in his own country only,) where the character which\n    he assumes is allowed to pass current. This Mowbray, now--this\n    brother-in-law of mine--might do pretty well at a Northern Meeting,\n    or the Leith races, where he could give five minutes to the sport of\n    the day, and the next half hour to county politics, or to farming;\n    but it is scarce necessary to tell you, Harry, that this half\n    fellowship will not pass on the better side of the Tweed.\n\n    \"Yet, for all I have told you, this trout was not easily tickled;\n    nor should I have made much of him, had he not, in the plenitude of\n    his northern conceit, entertained that notion of my being a good\n    subject of plunder, which you had contrived (blessings on your\n    contriving brain!) to insinuate into him by means of Wolverine. He\n    commenced this hopeful experiment, and, as you must have\n    anticipated, caught a Tartar with a vengeance. Of course, I used my\n    victory only so far as to secure his interest in accomplishing my\n    principal object; and yet, I could see my gentleman's pride was so\n    much injured in the course of the negotiation, that not all the\n    advantages which the match offered to his damned family, were able\n    entirely to subdue the chagrin arising from his defeat. He did gulp\n    it down, though, and we are friends and allies, for the present at\n    least--not so cordially so, however, as to induce me to trust him\n    with the whole of the strangely complicated tale. The circumstance\n    of the will it was necessary to communicate, as affording a\n    sufficiently strong reason for urging my suit; and this partial\n    disclosure enabled me for the present to dispense with farther\n    confidence.\n\n    \"You will observe, that I stand by no means secure; and besides the\n    chance of my cousin's reappearance--a certain event, unless he is\n    worse than I dare hope for--I have perhaps to expect the fantastic\n    repugnance of Clara herself, or some sulky freak on her brother's\n    part.--In a word--and let it be such a one as conjurers raise the\n    devil with--Harry Jekyl, I _want_ you.\n\n    \"As well knowing the nature of my friend, I can assure you that his\n    own interest, as well as mine, may be advanced by his coming hither\n    on duty. Here is a blockhead, whom I already mentioned, Sir Bingo\n    Binks, with whom something may be done worth _your_ while, though\n    scarce worth _mine_. The Baronet is a perfect buzzard, and when I\n    came here he was under Mowbray's training. But the awkward Scot had\n    plucked half-a-dozen penfeathers from his wing with so little\n    precaution, that the Baronet has become frightened and shy, and is\n    now in the act of rebelling against Mowbray, whom he both hates and\n    fears--the least backing from a knowing hand like you, and the bird\n    becomes your own, feathers and all.--Moreover,\n\n            ----'by my life,\n    This Bingo hath a mighty pretty wife.'\n\n    A lovely woman, Harry--rather plump, and above the middle\n    size--quite your taste--A Juno in beauty, looking with such scorn on\n    her husband, whom she despises and hates, and seeming, as if she\n    _could_ look so differently on any one whom she might like better,\n    that, on my faith, 'twere sin not to give her occasion. If you\n    please to venture your luck, either with the knight or the lady, you\n    shall have fair play, and no interference--that is, provided you\n    appear upon this summons; for, otherwise, I may be so placed, that\n    the affairs of the knight and the lady may fall under my own\n    immediate cognizance. And so, Harry, if you wish to profit by these\n    hints, you had best make haste, as well for your own concerns, as to\n    assist me in mine.--Yours, Harry, as you behave yourself,\n\n    \"ETHERINGTON.\"\n\nHaving finished this eloquent and instructive epistle, the young Earl\ndemanded the attendance of his own valet Solmes, whom he charged to put\nit into the post-office without delay, and with his own hand.\n\n\n\n\nAUTHOR'S NOTES.\n\n\nNote I., p. 14.--BUILDING-FEUS IN SCOTLAND.\n\nIn Scotland a village is erected upon a species of landright, very\ndifferent from the copyhold so frequent in England. Every alienation or\nsale of landed property must be made in the shape of a feudal\nconveyance, and the party who acquires it holds thereby an absolute and\nperfect right of property in the fief, while he discharges the\nstipulations of the vassal, and, above all, pays the feu-duties. The\nvassal or tenant of the site of the smallest cottage holds his\npossession as absolutely as the proprietor, of whose large estate it is\nperhaps scarce a perceptible portion. By dint of excellent laws, the\nsasines, or deeds of delivery of such fiefs, are placed on record in\nsuch order, that every burden affecting the property can be seen for\npayment of a very moderate fee; so that a person proposing to lend money\nupon it, knows exactly the nature and extent of his security.\n\nFrom the nature of these landrights being so explicit and secure, the\nScottish people have been led to entertain a jealousy of\nbuilding-leases, of however long duration. Not long ago, a great landed\nproprietor took the latter mode of disposing of some ground near a\nthriving town in the west country. The number of years in the lease was\nsettled at nine hundred and ninety-nine. All was agreed to, and the\ndeeds were ordered to be drawn. But the tenant, as he walked down the\navenue, began to reflect that the lease, though so very long as to be\nalmost perpetual, nevertheless had a termination; and that after the\nlapse of a thousand years, lacking one, the connexion of his family and\nrepresentatives with the estate would cease. He took a qualm at the\nthought of the loss to be sustained by his posterity a thousand years\nhence; and going back to the house of the gentleman who feued the\nground, he demanded, and readily obtained, the additional term of fifty\nyears to be added to the lease.\n\n\nNote II., p. 90.--DARK LADYE.\n\nThe Dark Ladye is one of those tantalizing fragments, in which Mr.\nColeridge has shown us what exquisite powers of poetry he has suffered\nto remain uncultivated. Let us be thankful for what we have received,\nhowever. The unfashioned ore, drawn from so rich a mine, is worth all to\nwhich art can add its highest decorations, when drawn from less abundant\nsources. The verses beginning the poem which are published separately,\nare said to have soothed the last hours of Mr. Fox. They are the stanzas\nentitled LOVE.\n\n\nNote III., p. 252.--MAGO-PICO.\n\nThis satire, very popular even in Scotland, at least with one party, was\ncomposed at the expense of a reverend presbyterian divine, of whom many\nstories are preserved, being Mr. Pyet, the Mago-Pico of the Tale,\nminister of Dunbar. The work is now little known in Scotland, and not at\nall in England, though written with much strong and coarse humour,\nresembling the style of Arbuthnot. It was composed by Mr. Haliburton, a\nmilitary chaplain. The distresses attending Mago-Pico's bachelor life,\nare thus stated:--\n\n    \"At the same time I desire you will only figure out to yourself his\n    situation during his celibacy in the ministerial charge--a house\n    lying all heaps upon heaps; his bed ill-made, swarming with fleas,\n    and very cold on the winter nights; his sheep's-head not to be eaten\n    for wool and hair, his broth singed, his bread mouldy, his lamb and\n    pig all scouthered, his house neither washed nor plastered; his\n    black stockings darned with white worsted above the shoes; his\n    butter made into cat's harns; his cheese one heap of mites and\n    maggots, and full of large avenues for rats and mice to play at\n    hide-and-seek and make their nests in. Frequent were the admonitions\n    he had given his maid-servants on this score, and every now and then\n    he was turning them off; but still the last was the worst, and in\n    the meanwhile the poor man was the sufferer. At any rate, therefore,\n    matrimony must turn to his account, though his wife should prove to\n    be nothing but a creature of the feminine gender, with a tongue in\n    her head, and ten fingers on her hands, to clear out the papers of\n    the housemaid, not to mention the convenience of a man's having it\n    in his power lawfully to beget sons and daughters in his own\n    house.\"--_Memoirs of Mago-Pico.

The Culdees have\ngiven rise to a world of dispute, and he would be a bold man who\npretended to understand their exact position. The name seems to be _Cele\nDe_, \"servant [gillie] of God.\" They were not Columban monks, but fill a\ngap between the expulsion of the Columbans by the Picts, and the\nAnglicising and Romanising of the Scottish Church by St. Margaret and\nher sons. Originally solitary ascetics, they clustered into groups, and,\nif we are to believe their supplanters at St. Andrews, the Canons\nRegular, they were married men, and used church property for family\nprofit. Their mass they celebrated with a rite of their own, in their\nlittle church. They were gradually merged in, and overpowered at St.\nAndrews, for example, by the Canons Regular, and are last heard of in\nprosecuting a claim to elect the Bishop, at the time of Edward the\nFirst's interference with Scottish affairs. The points on which they\ndiffered from Roman practice would probably have seemed very\ninsignificant to such a theologian as Meg Dods.\n\n[I-D] p. 47. \"Fortunio, in the fairy-tale.\" The gifted companions of\nFortunio, Keen-eye, Keen-ear, and so forth, are very old stock\ncharacters in M\u00c3\u00a4rchen: their first known appearance is in the saga of\nJason and the Fleece of Gold.\n\n[I-E] p. 169. \"The sportsman's sense of his own cruelty.\" In the\nreminiscences of Captain Basil Hall, published by Lockhart, he mentions\nthat Scott himself had a dislike of shooting, from a sentiment as to the\ncruelty of the sport. \"I was never quite at ease when I had knocked down\nmy blackcock, and going to pick him up he cast back his dying eye with a\nlook of reproach. I don't affect to be more squeamish than my\nneighbours, but I am not ashamed to say that no practice ever reconciled\nme fully to the cruelty of the affair.

RONAN'S WELL.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I.\n\nTHEATRICALS.\n\n    ----The play's the thing.\n\n_Hamlet._\n\n\nThe important day had now arrived, the arrangement for which had for\nsome time occupied all the conversation and thoughts of the good company\nat the Well of St. Ronan's. To give it, at the same time, a degree of\nnovelty and consequence, Lady Penelope Penfeather had long since\nsuggested to Mr. Mowbray, that the more gifted and accomplished part of\nthe guests might contribute to furnish out entertainment for the rest,\nby acting a few scenes of some popular drama; an accomplishment in which\nher self-conceit assured her that she was peculiarly qualified to excel.\nMr. Mowbray, who seemed on this occasion to have thrown the reins\nentirely into her ladyship's hands, made no objection to the plan which\nshe proposed, excepting that the old-fashioned hedges and walks of the\ngarden at Shaws-Castle must necessarily serve for stage and scenery, as\nthere was no time to fit up the old hall for the exhibition of the\nproposed theatricals.[II-1] But upon enquiry among the company, this plan\nwas wrecked upon the ordinary shelve, to wit, the difficulty of finding\nperformers who would consent to assume the lower characters of the\ndrama. For the first parts there were candidates more than enough; but\nmost of these were greatly too high-spirited to play the fool, except\nthey were permitted to top the part. Then amongst the few unambitious\nunderlings, who could be coaxed or cajoled to undertake subordinate\ncharacters, there were so many bad memories, and short memories, and\ntreacherous memories, that at length the plan was resigned in despair.\n\nA substitute, proposed by Lady Penelope, was next considered. It was\nproposed to act what the Italians call a Comedy of Character; that is,\nnot an exact drama, in which the actors deliver what is set down for\nthem by the author; but one, in which the plot having been previously\nfixed upon, and a few striking scenes adjusted, the actors are expected\nto supply the dialogue extempore, or, as Petruchio says, from their\nmother wit. This is an amusement which affords much entertainment in\nItaly, particularly in the state of Venice, where the characters of\ntheir drama have been long since all previously fixed, and are handed\ndown by tradition; and this species of drama, though rather belonging to\nthe mask than the theatre, is distinguished by the name of Commedia\ndell' Arte.[II-2] But the shamefaced character of Britons is still more\nalien from a species of display, where there is a constant and\nextemporaneous demand for wit, or the sort of ready small-talk which\nsupplies its place, than from the regular exhibitions of the drama,\nwhere the author, standing responsible for language and sentiment,\nleaves to the personators of the scenes only the trouble of finding\nenunciation and action.\n\nBut the ardent and active spirit of Lady Penelope, still athirst after\nnovelty, though baffled in her two first projects, brought forward a\nthird, in which she was more successful. This was the proposal to\ncombine a certain number, at least, of the guests, properly dressed for\nthe occasion, as representing some well-known historical or dramatic\ncharacters, in a group, having reference to history, or to a scene of\nthe drama. In this representation, which may be called playing a\npicture, action, even pantomimical action, was not expected; and all\nthat was required of the performers, was to throw themselves into such a\ngroup as might express a marked and striking point of an easily\nremembered scene, but where the actors are at a pause, and without\neither speech or motion. In this species of representation there was no\ntax, either on the invention or memory of those who might undertake\nparts; and, what recommended it still farther to the good company, there\nwas no marked difference betwixt the hero and heroine of the group, and\nthe less distinguished characters by whom they were attended on the\nstage; and every one who had confidence in a handsome shape and a\nbecoming dress, might hope, though standing in not quite so broad and\nfavourable a light as the principal personages, to draw, nevertheless, a\nconsiderable portion of attention and applause. This motion, therefore,\nthat the company, or such of them as might choose to appear properly\ndressed for the occasion, should form themselves into one or more\ngroups, which might be renewed and varied as often as they pleased, was\nhailed and accepted as a bright idea, which assigned to every one a\nshare of the importance attached to its probable success.\n\nMowbray, on his side, promised to contrive some arrangement which should\nseparate the actors in this mute drama from the spectators, and enable\nthe former to vary the amusement, by withdrawing themselves from the\nscene, and again appearing upon it under a different and new\ncombination. This plan of exhibition, where fine clothes and affected\nattitudes supplied all draughts upon fancy or talent, was highly\nagreeable to most of the ladies present; and even Lady Binks, whose\ndiscontent seemed proof against every effort that could be proposed to\nsoothe it, acquiesced in the project, with perfect indifference indeed,\nbut with something less of sullenness than usual.\n\nIt now only remained to rummage the circulating library, for some piece\nof sufficient celebrity to command attention, and which should be at the\nsame time suited to the execution of their project. Bell's British\nTheatre, Miller's Modern and Ancient Drama, and about twenty odd\nvolumes, in which stray tragedies and comedies were associated, like the\npassengers in a mail-coach, without the least attempt at selection or\narrangement, were all examined in the course of their researches. But\nLady Penelope declared loftily and decidedly for Shakspeare, as the\nauthor whose immortal works were fresh in every one's recollection.\nShakspeare was therefore chosen, and from his works the Midsummer\nNight's Dream was selected, as the play which afforded the greatest\nvariety of characters, and most scope of course for the intended\nrepresentation. An active competition presently occurred among the\ngreater part of the company, for such copies of the Midsummer Night's\nDream, or the volume of Shakspeare containing it, as could be got in the\nneighbourhood; for, notwithstanding Lady Penelope's declaration, that\nevery one who could read had Shakspeare's plays by heart, it appeared\nthat such of his dramas as have not kept possession of the stage, were\nvery little known at St. Ronan's, save among those people who are\nemphatically called readers.\n\nThe adjustment of the parts was the first subject of consideration, so\nsoon as those who intended to assume characters had refreshed their\nrecollection on the subject of the piece. Theseus was unanimously\nassigned to Mowbray, the giver of the entertainment, and therefore\njustly entitled to represent the Duke of Athens. The costume of an\nAmazonian crest and plume, a tucked-up vest, and a tight buskin of\nsky-blue silk, buckled with diamonds, reconciled Lady Binks to the part\nof Hippolyta. The superior stature of Miss Mowbray to Lady Penelope,\nmade it necessary that the former should perform the part of Helena, and\nher ladyship rest contented with the shrewish character of Hermia. It\nwas resolved to compliment the young Earl of Etherington with the part\nof Lysander, which, however, his lordship declined, and, preferring\ncomedy to tragedy, refused to appear in any other character than that of\nthe magnanimous Bottom; and he gave them such a humorous specimen of his\nquality in that part, that all were delighted at once with his\ncondescension in assuming, and his skill in performing, the presenter of\nPyramus.\n\nThe part of Egeus was voted to Captain MacTurk, whose obstinacy in\nrefusing to appear in any other than the full Highland garb, had nearly\ndisconcerted the whole affair. At length this obstacle was got over, on\nthe authority of Childe Harold, who remarks the similarity betwixt the\nHighland and Grecian costume,[II-3] and the company, dispensing with the\ndifference of colour, voted the Captain's variegated kilt, of the\nMacTurk tartan, to be the kirtle of a Grecian mountaineer,--Egeus to be\nan Arnout, and the Captain to be Egeus. Chatterly and the painter,\nwalking gentlemen by profession, agreed to walk through the parts of\nDemetrius and Lysander, the two Athenian lovers; and Mr. Winterblossom,\nloath and lazy, after many excuses, was bribed by Lady Penelope with an\nantique, or supposed antique cameo, to play the part of Philostratus,\nmaster of the revels, provided his gout would permit him to remain so\nlong upon the turf, which was to be their stage.\n\nMuslin trowsers, adorned with spangles, a voluminous turban of silver\ngauze, and wings of the same, together with an embroidered slipper,\nconverted at once Miss Digges into Oberon, the King of Shadows, whose\nsovereign gravity, however, was somewhat indifferently represented by\nthe silly gaiety of Miss in her Teens, and the uncontrolled delight\nwhich she felt in her fine clothes. A younger sister represented\nTitania; and two or three subordinate elves were selected, among\nfamilies attending the salutiferous fountain, who were easily persuaded\nto let their children figure in fine clothes at so juvenile an age,\nthough they shook their head at Miss Digges and her pantaloons, and no\nless at the liberal display of Lady Binks's right leg, with which the\nAmazonian garb gratified the public of St. Ronan's.\n\nDr. Quackleben was applied to to play Wall, by the assistance of such a\nwooden horse, or screen, as clothes are usually dried upon; the old\nAttorney stood for Lion; and the other characters of Bottom's drama were\neasily found among the unnamed frequenters of the Spring. Dressed\nrehearsals, and so forth, went merrily on--all voted there was a play\nfitted.\n\nBut even the Doctor's eloquence could not press Mrs. Blower into the\nscheme, although she was particularly wanted to represent Thisbe.\n\n\"Truth is,\" she replied, \"I dinna greatly like stage-plays. John Blower,\nhonest man, as sailors are aye for some spree or another, wad take me\nance to see ane Mrs. Siddons--I thought we should hae been crushed to\ndeath before we gat in--a' my things riven aff my back, forby the four\nlily-white shillings that it cost us--and then in came three frightsome\ncarlines wi' besoms, and they wad bewitch a sailor's wife--I was lang\neneugh there--and out I wad be, and out John Blower gat me, but wi' nae\nsma' fight and fend.--My Lady Penelope Penfitter, and the great folk,\nmay just take it as they like; but in my mind, Dr. Cacklehen, it's a\nmere blasphemy for folk to gar themselves look otherwise than their\nMaker made them; and then the changing the name which was given them at\nbaptism, is, I think, an awful falling away from our vows; and though\nThisby, which I take to be Greek for Tibbie, may be a very good name,\nyet Margaret was I christened, and Margaret will I die.\"\n\n\"You mistake the matter entirely, my dear Mrs. Blower,\" said the Doctor;\n\"there is nothing serious intended--a mere _placebo_--just a\ndivertisement to cheer the spirits, and assist the effect of the\nwaters--cheerfulness is a great promoter of health.\"\n\n\"Dinna tell me o' health, Dr. Kittlepin!--Can it be for the puir body\nM'Durk's health to major about in the tartans like a tobacconist's sign\nin a frosty morning, wi' his poor wizzened houghs as blue as a\nblawort?--weel I wot he is a humbling spectacle. Or can it gie ony body\nhealth or pleasure either to see your ainsell, Doctor, ganging about wi'\na claise screen tied to your back, covered wi' paper, and painted like a\nstane and lime wa'?--I'll gang to see nane o' their vanities, Dr.\nKittlehen; and if there is nae other decent body to take care o' me, as\nI dinna like to sit a haill afternoon by mysell, I'll e'en gae doun to\nMr. Sowerbrowst the maltster's--he is a pleasant, sensible man, and a\nsponsible man in the world, and his sister's a very decent woman.\"\n\n\"Confound Sowerbrowst,\" thought the Doctor; \"if I had guessed he was to\ncome across me thus, he should not have got the better of his dyspepsy\nso early.--My dear Mrs. Blower,\" he continued, but aloud, \"it is a\nfoolish affair enough, I must confess; but every person of style and\nfashion at the Well has settled to attend this exhibition; there has\nbeen nothing else talked of for this month through the whole country,\nand it will be a year before it is forgotten. And I would have you\nconsider how ill it will look, my dear Mrs. Blower, to stay away--nobody\nwill believe you had a card--no, not though you were to hang it round\nyour neck like a label round a vial of tincture, Mrs. Blower.\"\n\n\"If ye thought _that_, Doctor Kickherben,\" said the widow, alarmed at\nthe idea of losing caste, \"I wad e'en gang to the show, like other folk;\nsinful and shameful if it be, let them that make the sin bear the shame.\nBut then I will put on nane of their Popish disguises--me that has lived\nin North Leith, baith wife and lass, for I shanna say how mony years,\nand has a character to keep up baith with saint and sinner.--And then,\nwha's to take care of me, since you are gaun to make a lime-and-stane\nwa' of yoursell, Dr. Kickinben?\"\n\n\"My dear Mrs. Blower, if such is your determination, I will not make a\nwall of myself. Her ladyship must consider my profession--she must\nunderstand it is my function to look after my patients, in preference to\nall the stage-plays in this world--and to attend on a case like yours,\nMrs. Blower, it is my duty to sacrifice, were it called for, the whole\ndrama from Shakspeare to O'Keefe.\"\n\nOn hearing this magnanimous resolution, the widow's heart was greatly\ncheered; for, in fact, she might probably have considered the Doctor's\nperseverance in the plan, of which she had expressed such high\ndisapprobation, as little less than a symptom of absolute defection from\nhis allegiance. By an accommodation, therefore, which suited both\nparties, it was settled that the Doctor should attend his loving widow\nto Shaws-Castle, without mask or mantle; and that the painted screen\nshould be transferred from Quackleben's back to the broad shoulders of a\nbriefless barrister, well qualified for the part of Wall, since the\ncomposition of his skull might have rivalled in solidity the mortar and\nstone of the most approved builder.\n\nWe must not pause to dilate upon the various labours of body and spirit\nwhich preceded the intervening space, betwixt the settlement of this gay\nscheme, and the time appointed to carry it into execution. We will not\nattempt to describe how the wealthy, by letter and by commissioners,\nurged their researches through the stores of the Gallery of Fashion for\nspecimens of Oriental finery--how they that were scant of diamonds\nsupplied their place with paste and Bristol stones--how the country\ndealers were driven out of patience by the demand for goods of which\nthey had never before heard the name--and, lastly, how the busy fingers\nof the more economical damsels twisted handkerchiefs into turbans, and\nconverted petticoats into pantaloons, shaped and sewed, cut and clipped,\nand spoiled many a decent gown and petticoat, to produce something like\na Grecian habit. Who can describe the wonders wrought by active needles\nand scissors, aided by thimbles and thread, upon silver gauze, and\nsprigged muslin? or who can show how, if the fair nymphs of the Spring\ndid not entirely succeed in attaining the desired resemblance to\nheathen Greeks, they at least contrived to get rid of all similitude to\nsober Christians?\n\nNeither is it necessary to dwell upon the various schemes of conveyance\nwhich were resorted to, in order to transfer the beau monde of the Spa\nto the scene of revelry at Shaws-Castle. These were as various as the\nfortunes and pretensions of the owners; from the lordly curricle, with\nits outriders, to the humble taxed cart, nay, untaxed cart, which\nconveyed the personages of lesser rank. For the latter, indeed, the two\npost-chaises at the Inn seemed converted into hourly stages, so often\ndid they come and go between the Hotel and the Castle--a glad day for\nthe postilions, and a day of martyrdom for the poor post-horses; so\nseldom is it that every department of any society, however constituted,\ncan be injured or benefited by the same occurrence.\n\nSuch, indeed, was the penury of vehicular conveyance, that applications\nwere made in manner most humble, even to Meg Dods herself, entreating\nshe would permit her old whiskey to _ply_ (for such might have been the\nphrase) at St. Ronan's Well, for that day only, and that upon good cause\nshown. But not for sordid lucre would the undaunted spirit of Meg\ncompound her feud with her neighbours of the detested Well. \"Her\ncarriage,\" she briefly replied, \"was engaged for her ain guest and the\nminister, and deil anither body's fit should gang intill't. Let every\nherring hing by its ain head.\" And, accordingly, at the duly appointed\nhour, creaked forth, the leathern convenience, in which, carefully\nscreened by the curtain from the gaze of the fry of the village, sat\nNabob Touchwood, in the costume of an Indian merchant, or Shroff, as\nthey are termed. The clergyman would not, perhaps, have been so\npunctual, had not a set of notes and messages from his friend at the\nCleikum, ever following each other as thick as the papers which decorate\nthe tail of a schoolboy's kite, kept him so continually on the alert\nfrom daybreak till noon, that Mr. Touchwood found him completely\ndressed; and the whiskey was only delayed for about ten minutes before\nthe door of the manse, a space employed by Mr. Cargill in searching for\nthe spectacles, which at last were happily discovered upon his own nose.\n\nAt length, seated by the side of his new friend, Mr. Cargill arrived\nsafe at Shaws-Castle, the gate of which mansion was surrounded by a\nscreaming group of children, so extravagantly delighted at seeing the\nstrange figures to whom each successive carriage gave birth, that even\nthe stern brow and well-known voice of Johnie Tirlsneck, the beadle,\nthough stationed in the court on express purpose, was not equal to the\ntask of controlling them. These noisy intruders, however, who, it was\nbelieved, were somewhat favoured by Clara Mowbray, were excluded from\nthe court which opened before the house, by a couple of grooms or\nhelpers armed with their whips, and could only salute, with their shrill\nand wondering hailing, the various personages, as they passed down a\nshort avenue leading from the exterior gate.\n\nThe Cleikum nabob and the minister were greeted with shouts not the\nleast clamorous; which the former merited by the ease with which he wore\nthe white turban, and the latter, by the infrequency of his appearance\nin public, and both, by the singular association of a decent clergyman\nof the church of Scotland, in a dress more old-fashioned than could now\nbe produced in the General Assembly, walking arm in arm, and seemingly\nin the most familiar terms, with a Parsee merchant. They stopped a\nmoment at the gate of the court-yard to admire the front of the old\nmansion, which had been disturbed with so unusual a scene of gaiety.\n\nShaws-Castle, though so named, presented no appearance of defence; and\nthe present edifice had never been designed for more than the\naccommodation of a peaceful family, having a low, heavy front, loaded\nwith some of that meretricious ornament, which, uniting, or rather\nconfounding, the Gothic and Grecian architecture, was much used during\nthe reigns of James VI. of Scotland, and his unfortunate son. The court\nformed a small square, two sides of which were occupied by such\nbuildings as were required for the family, and the third by the stables,\nthe only part to which much attention had been paid, the present Mr.\nMowbray having put them into excellent order. The fourth side of the\nsquare was shut up by a screen wall, through which a door opened to the\navenue; the whole being a kind of structure, which may be still found on\nthose old Scottish properties, where a rage to render their place\n_Parkish_, as was at one time the prevailing phrase, has not induced the\nowners to pull down the venerable and sheltering appendages with which\ntheir wiser fathers had screened their mansion, and to lay the whole\nopen to the keen north-east; much after the fashion of a spinster of\nfifty, who chills herself to gratify the public by an exposure of her\nthin red elbows, and shrivelled neck and bosom.\n\nA double door, thrown hospitably open on the present occasion, admitted\nthe company into a dark and low hall, where Mowbray himself, wearing\nthe under dress of Theseus, but not having yet assumed his ducal cap and\nrobes, stood to receive his guests with due courtesy, and to indicate to\neach the road allotted to him. Those who were to take a share in the\nrepresentation of the morning, were conducted to an old saloon, destined\nfor a green-room, and which communicated with a series of apartments on\nthe right, hastily fitted with accommodations for arranging and\ncompleting their toilet; while others, who took no part in the intended\ndrama, were ushered to the left, into a large, unfurnished, and long\ndisused dining parlour, where a sashed door opened into the gardens,\ncrossed with yew and holly hedges, still trimmed and clipped by the old\ngrey-headed gardener, upon those principles which a Dutchman thought\nworthy of commemorating in a didactic poem upon the _Ars Topiaria_.\n\nA little wilderness, surrounding a beautiful piece of the smoothest\nturf, and itself bounded by such high hedges as we have described, had\nbeen selected as the stage most proper for the exhibition of the\nintended dramatic picture. It afforded many facilities; for a rising\nbank exactly in front was accommodated with seats for the spectators,\nwho had a complete view of the silvan theatre, the bushes and shrubs\nhaving been cleared away, and the place supplied with a temporary\nscreen, which, being withdrawn by the domestics appointed for that\npurpose, was to serve for the rising of the curtain. A covered trellis,\nwhich passed through another part of the garden, and terminated with a\nprivate door opening from the right wing of the building, seemed as if\nit had been planted on purpose for the proposed exhibition, as it served\nto give the personages of the drama a convenient and secret access from\nthe green-room to the place of representation. Indeed, the dramatis\nperson\u00c3\u00a6, at least those who adopted the management of the matter, were\ninduced, by so much convenience, to extend, in some measure, their\noriginal plan; and, instead of one group, as had been at first proposed,\nthey now found themselves able to exhibit to the good company a\nsuccession of three or four, selected and arranged from different parts\nof the drama; thus giving some duration, as well as some variety, to the\nentertainment, besides the advantage of separating and contrasting the\ntragic and the comic scenes.\n\nAfter wandering about amongst the gardens, which contained little to\ninterest any one, and endeavouring to recognise some characters, who,\naccommodating themselves to the humours of the day, had ventured to\nappear in the various disguises of ballad-singers, pedlars, shepherds,\nHighlanders, and so forth, the company began to draw together towards\nthe spot where the seats prepared for them, and the screen drawn in\nfront of the bosky stage, induced them to assemble, and excited\nexpectation, especially as a scroll in front of the esplanade set forth,\nin the words of the play, \"This green plot shall be our stage, this\nhawthorn brake our tiring-house, and we will do it in action.\" A delay\nof about ten minutes began to excite some suppressed murmurs of\nimpatience among the audience, when the touch of Gow's fiddle suddenly\nburst from a neighbouring hedge, behind which he had established his\nlittle orchestra. All were of course silent,\n\n    \"As through his dear strathspeys he bore with Highland rage.\"\n\nAnd when he changed his strain to an adagio, and suffered his music to\ndie away in the plaintive notes of Roslin Castle, the echoes of the old\nwalls were, after a long slumber, awakened by that enthusiastic burst of\napplause, with which the Scots usually received and rewarded their\ncountry's gifted minstrel.\n\n\"He is his father's own son,\" said Touchwood to the clergyman, for both\nhad gotten seats near about the centre of the place of audience. \"It is\nmany a long year since I listened to old Neil at Inver, and, to say\ntruth, spent a night with him over pancakes and Athole brose; and I\nnever expected to hear his match again in my lifetime. But stop--the\ncurtain rises.\"\n\nThe screen was indeed withdrawn, and displayed Hermia, Helena, and their\nlovers, in attitudes corresponding to the scene of confusion occasioned\nby the error of Puck.\n\nMessrs. Chatterly and the Painter played their parts neither better nor\nworse than amateur actors in general; and the best that could be said of\nthem was, that they seemed more than half ashamed of their exotic\ndresses, and of the public gaze.\n\nBut against this untimely weakness Lady Penelope was guarded, by the\nstrong shield of self-conceit. She minced, ambled, and, notwithstanding\nthe slight appearance of her person, and the depredations which time had\nmade on a countenance that had never been very much distinguished for\nbeauty, seemed desirous to top the part of the beautiful daughter of\nEgeus. The sullenness which was proper to the character of Hermia, was\nmuch augmented by the discovery that Miss Mowbray was so much better\ndressed than herself,--a discovery which she had but recently made, as\nthat young lady had not attended on the regular rehearsals at the Well,\nbut once, and then without her stage habit. Her ladyship, however, did\nnot permit this painful sense of inferiority, where she had expected\ntriumph, so far to prevail over her desire of shining, as to interrupt\nmaterially the manner in which she had settled to represent her portion\nof the scene. The nature of the exhibition precluded much action, but\nLady Penelope made amends by such a succession of grimaces, as might\nrival, in variety at least, the singular display which Garrick used to\ncall \"going his rounds.\" She twisted her poor features into looks of\nmost desperate love towards Lysander; into those of wonder and offended\npride, when she turned them upon Demetrius; and finally settled them on\nHelena, with the happiest possible imitation of an incensed rival, who\nfeels the impossibility of relieving her swollen heart by tears alone,\nand is just about to have recourse to her nails.\n\nNo contrast could be stronger in looks, demeanour, and figure, than that\nbetween Hermia and Helena. In the latter character, the beautiful form\nand foreign dress of Miss Mowbray attracted all eyes. She kept her place\non the stage, as a sentinel does that which his charge assigns him; for\nshe had previously told her brother, that though she consented, at his\nimportunity, to make part of the exhibition, it was as a piece of the\nscene, not as an actor, and accordingly a painted figure could scarce be\nmore immovable. The expression of her countenance seemed to be that of\ndeep sorrow and perplexity, belonging to her part, over which wandered\nat times an air of irony or ridicule, as if she were secretly scorning\nthe whole exhibition, and even herself for condescending to become part\nof it. Above all, a sense of bashfulness had cast upon her cheek a\ncolour, which, though sufficiently slight, was more than her countenance\nwas used to display; and when the spectators beheld, in the splendour\nand grace of a rich Oriental dress, her whom they had hitherto been\naccustomed to see attired only in the most careless manner, they felt\nthe additional charms of surprise and contrast; so that the bursts of\napplause which were vollied towards the stage, might be said to be\naddressed to her alone, and to vie in sincerity with those which have\nbeen forced from an audience by the most accomplished performer.\n\n\"Oh, that puir Lady Penelope!\" said honest Mrs. Blower, who, when her\nscruples against the exhibition were once got over, began to look upon\nit with particular interest,--\"I am really sorry for her puir face, for\nshe gars it work like the sails of John Blower's vesshel in a stiff\nbreeze.--Oh, Doctor Cacklehen, dinna ye think she wad need, if it were\npossible, to rin ower her face wi' a gusing iron, just to take the\nwrunkles out o't?\"\n\n\"Hush, hush! my good dear Mrs. Blower,\" said the Doctor; \"Lady Penelope\nis a woman of quality, and my patient, and such people always act\ncharmingly--you must understand there is no hissing at a private\ntheatre--Hem!\"\n\n\"Ye may say what ye like, Doctor, but there is nae fule like an auld\nfule--To be sure, if she was as young and beautiful as Miss\nMowbray--hegh me, and I didna use to think her sae bonny neither--but\ndress--dress makes an unco difference--That shawl o' hers--I daur say\nthe like o't was ne'er seen in braid Scotland--It will be real Indian,\nI'se warrant.\"\n\n\"Real Indian!\" said Mr. Touchwood, in an accent of disdain, which rather\ndisturbed Mrs. Blower's equanimity,--\"why, what do you suppose it should\nbe, madam?\"\n\n\"I dinna ken, sir,\" said she, edging somewhat nearer the Doctor, not\nbeing altogether pleased, as she afterwards allowed, with the outlandish\nappearance and sharp tone of the traveller; then pulling her own drapery\nround her shoulders, she added, courageously, \"There are braw shawls\nmade at Paisley, that ye will scarce ken frae foreign.\"\n\n\"Not know Paisley shawls from Indian, madam?\" said Touchwood; \"why, a\nblind man could tell by the slightest touch of his little finger. Yon\nshawl, now, is the handsomest I have seen in Britain--and at this\ndistance I can tell it to be a real _Tozie_.\"\n\n\"Cozie may she weel be that wears it,\" said Mrs. Blower. \"I declare, now\nI look on't again, it's a perfect beauty.\"\n\n\"It is called Tozie, ma'am, not cozie,\" continued the traveller; \"the\nShroffs at Surat told me in 1801, that it is made out of the inner coat\nof a goat.\"\n\n\"Of a sheep, sir, I am thinking ye mean, for goats has nae woo'.\"\n\n\"Not much of it, indeed, madam, but you are to understand they use only\nthe inmost coat; and then their dyes--that Tozie now will keep its\ncolour while there is a rag of it left--men bequeath them in legacies to\ntheir grandchildren.\"\n\n\"And a very bonny colour it is,\" said the dame; \"something like a\nmouse's back, only a thought redder--I wonder what they ca' that\ncolour.\"\n\n\"The colour is much admired, madam,\" said Touchwood, who was now on a\nfavourite topic; \"the Mussulmans say the colour is betwixt that of an\nelephant and the breast of the _faughta_.\"\n\n\"In troth, I am as wise as I was,\" said Mrs. Blower.\n\n\"The _faughta_, madam, so called by the Moors, (for the Hindhus call it\n_hollah_,) is a sort of pigeon, held sacred among the Moslem of India,\nbecause they think it dyed its breast in the blood of Ali.--But I see\nthey are closing the scene.--Mr. Cargill, are you composing your sermon,\nmy good friend, or what can you be thinking of?\"\n\nMr. Cargill had, during the whole scene, remained with his eyes fixed,\nin intent and anxious, although almost unconscious gaze, upon Clara\nMowbray; and when the voice of his companion startled him out of his\nreverie, he exclaimed, \"Most lovely--most unhappy--yes--I must and will\nsee her!\"\n\n\"See her?\" replied Touchwood, too much accustomed to his friend's\nsingularities to look for much reason or connexion in any thing he said\nor did; \"Why, you shall see her and talk to her too, if that will give\nyou pleasure.--They say now,\" he continued, lowering his voice to a\nwhisper, \"that this Mowbray is ruined. I see nothing like it, since he\ncan dress out his sister like a Begum. Did you ever see such a splendid\nshawl?\"\n\n\"Dearly purchased splendour,\" said Mr. Cargill, with a deep sigh; \"I\nwish that the price be yet fully paid!\"\n\n\"Very likely not,\" said the traveller; \"very likely it's gone to the\nbook; and for the price, I have known a thousand rupees given for such a\nshawl in the country.--But hush, hush, we are to have another tune from\nNathaniel--faith, and they are withdrawing the screen--Well, they have\nsome mercy--they do not let us wait long between the acts of their\nfollies at least--I love a quick and rattling fire in these\nvanities--Folly walking a funeral pace, and clinking her bells to the\ntime of a passing knell, makes sad work indeed.\"\n\nA strain of music, beginning slowly, and terminating in a light and wild\nallegro, introduced on the stage those delightful creatures of the\nrichest imagination that ever teemed with wonders, the Oberon and\nTitania of Shakspeare. The pigmy majesty of the captain of the fairy\nband had no unapt representative in Miss Digges, whose modesty was not\nso great an intruder as to prevent her desire to present him in all his\ndignity, and she moved, conscious of the graceful turn of a pretty\nankle, which, encircled with a string of pearls, and clothed in\nflesh-coloured silk, of the most cobweb texture, rose above the crimson\nsandal. Her jewelled tiara, too, gave dignity to the frown with which\nthe offended King of Shadows greeted his consort, as each entered upon\nthe scene at the head of their several attendants.\n\nThe restlessness of the children had been duly considered; and,\ntherefore, their part of the exhibition had been contrived to represent\ndumb show, rather than a stationary picture. The little Queen of Elves\nwas not inferior in action to her moody lord, and repaid, with a look of\nfemale impatience and scorn, the haughty air which seemed to express his\nsullen greeting,\n\n    \"Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.\"\n\nThe other children were, as usual, some clever and forward, some loutish\nand awkward enough; but the gambols of childhood are sure to receive\napplause, paid, perhaps, with a mixture of pity and envy, by those in\nadvanced life; and besides, there were in the company several fond papas\nand mammas, whose clamorous approbation, though given apparently to the\nwhole performers, was especially dedicated in their hearts to their own\nlittle Jackies and Marias,--for _Mary_, though the prettiest and most\nclassical of Scottish names, is now unknown in the land. The elves,\ntherefore, played their frolics, danced a measure, and vanished with\ngood approbation.\n\nThe anti-mask, as it may be called, of Bottom, and his company of\nactors, next appeared on the stage, and a thunder of applause received\nthe young Earl, who had, with infinite taste and dexterity, transformed\nhimself into the similitude of an Athenian clown; observing the Grecian\ncostume, yet so judiciously discriminated from the dress of the higher\ncharacters, as at once to fix the character of a thick-skinned mechanic\non the wearer. Touchwood, in particular, was loud in his approbation,\nfrom which the correctness of the costume must be inferred; for that\nhonest gentleman, like many other critics, was indeed not very much\ndistinguished for good taste, but had a capital memory for petty matters\nof fact; and, while the most impressive look or gesture of an actor\nmight have failed to interest him, would have censured most severely the\nfashion of a sleeve, or the colour of a shoe-tie.\n\nBut the Earl of Etherington's merits were not confined to his external\nappearance; for, had his better fortunes failed him, his deserts, like\nthose of Hamlet, might have got him a fellowship in a cry of players. He\npresented, though in dumb show, the pragmatic conceit of Bottom, to the\ninfinite amusement of all present, especially of those who were well\nacquainted with the original; and when he was \"translated\" by Puck, he\nbore the ass's head, his newly-acquired dignity, with an appearance of\nconscious greatness, which made the metamorphosis, though in itself\nsufficiently farcical, irresistibly comic. He afterwards displayed the\nsame humour in his frolics with the fairies, and the intercourse which\nhe held with Messrs. Cobweb, Mustard-seed, Pease-blossom, and the rest\nof Titania's cavaliers, who lost all command of their countenances at\nthe gravity with which he invited them to afford him the luxury of\nscratching his hairy snout. Mowbray had also found a fitting\nrepresentative for Puck in a queer-looking, small-eyed boy of the\nAultoun of St. Ronan's, with large ears projecting from his head like\nturrets from a Gothic building. This exotic animal personified the merry\nand mocking spirit of Hobgoblin with considerable power, so that the\ngroup bore some resemblance to the well-known and exquisite delineation\nof Puck by Sir Joshua, in the select collection of the Bard of Memory.\nIt was, however, the ruin of the St. Ronan's Robin Goodfellow, who did\nno good afterwards,--\"gaed an ill gate,\" as Meg Dods said, and \"took on\"\nwith a party of strolling players.\n\nThe entertainment closed with a grand parade of all the characters that\nhad appeared, during which Mowbray concluded that the young lord\nhimself, unremarked, might have time enough to examine the outward form,\nat least, of his sister Clara, whom, in the pride of his heart, he could\nnot help considering superior in beauty, dressed as she now was, with\nevery advantage of art, even to the brilliant Amazon, Lady Binks. It is\ntrue, Mowbray was not a man to give preference to the intellectual\nexpression of poor Clara's features over the sultana-like beauty of the\nhaughty dame, which promised to an admirer all the vicissitudes that can\nbe expressed by a countenance lovely in every change, and changing as\noften as an ardent and impetuous disposition, unused to constraint, and\ndespising admonition, should please to dictate. Yet, to do him justice,\nthough his preference was perhaps dictated more by fraternal partiality\nthan by purity of taste, he certainly, on the present occasion, felt the\nfull extent of Clara's superiority; and there was a proud smile on his\nlip, as, at the conclusion of the divertisement, he asked the Earl how\nhe had been pleased. The rest of the performers had separated, and the\nyoung lord remained on the stage, employed in disembarrassing himself of\nhis awkward visor, when Mowbray put this question, to which, though\ngeneral in terms, he naturally gave a particular meaning.\n\n\"I could wear my ass's head for ever,\" he said, \"on condition my eyes\nwere to be so delightfully employed as they have been during the last\nscene.--Mowbray, your sister is an angel!\"\n\n\"Have a care that that headpiece of yours has not perverted your taste,\nmy lord,\" said Mowbray. \"But why did you wear that disguise on your last\nappearance? You should, I think, have been uncovered.\"\n\n\"I am ashamed to answer you,\" said the Earl; \"but truth is, first\nimpressions are of consequence, and I thought I might do as wisely not\nto appear before your sister, for the first time, in the character of\nBully Bottom.\"\n\n\"Then you change your dress, my lord, for dinner, if we call our\nluncheon by that name?\" said Mowbray.\n\n\"I am going to my room this instant for that very purpose,\" replied the\nEarl.\n\n\"And I,\" said Mowbray, \"must step in front, and dismiss the audience;\nfor I see they are sitting gaping there, waiting for another scene.\"\n\nThey parted upon this; and Mowbray, as Duke Theseus, stepped before the\nscreen, and announcing the conclusion of the dramatic pictures which\nthey had had the honour to present before the worshipful company,\nthanked the spectators for the very favourable reception which they had\nafforded; and intimated to them, that if they could amuse themselves by\nstrolling for an hour among the gardens, a bell would summon to the\nhouse at the expiry of that time, when some refreshments would wait\ntheir acceptance. This annunciation was received with the applause due\nto the _Amphitryon ou l'on dine_; and the guests, arising from before\nthe temporary theatre, dispersed through the gardens, which were of some\nextent, to seek for or create amusement to themselves. The music greatly\naided them in this last purpose, and it was not long ere a dozen of\ncouples and upwards, were \"tripping it on the light fantastic toe,\" (I\nlove a phrase that is not hackneyed,) to the tune of Monymusk.\n\nOthers strolled through the grounds, meeting some quaint disguise at the\nend of every verdant alley, and communicating to others the surprise and\namusement which they themselves were receiving. The scene, from the\nvariety of dresses, the freedom which it gave to the display of humour\namongst such as possessed any, and the general disposition to give and\nreceive pleasure, rendered the little masquerade more entertaining than\nothers of the kind for which more ample and magnificent preparations\nhave been made. There was also a singular and pleasing contrast between\nthe fantastic figures who wandered through the gardens, and the quiet\nscene itself, to which the old clipt hedges, the formal distribution of\nthe ground, and the antiquated appearance of one or two fountains and\nartificial cascades, in which the naiads had been for the nonce\ncompelled to resume their ancient frolics, gave an appearance of unusual\nsimplicity and seclusion, and which seemed rather to belong to the last\nthan to the present generation.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[II-1] At Kilruddery, the noble seat of Lord Meath, in the county of\nWicklow, there is a situation for private theatrical exhibitions in the\nopen air, planted out with the evergreens which arise there in the most\nluxuriant magnificence. It has a wild and romantic effect, reminding one\nof the scene in which Bottom rehearsed his pageant, with a green plot\nfor a stage, and a hawthorn brake for a tiringroom.\n\n[II-2] See Mr. William Stewart Rose's very interesting Letters from the\nNorth of Italy, Vol. I.

At\nlength he caught a glimpse of the memorable shawl, which had drawn forth\nso learned a discussion from his companion; and, starting from\nTouchwood's side with a degree of anxious alertness totally foreign to\nhis usual habits, he endeavoured to join the person by whom it was worn.\n\n\"By the Lord,\" said his companion, \"the Doctor is beside himself!--the\nparson is mad!--the divine is out of his senses, that is clear; and how\nthe devil can he, who scarce can find his road from the Cleikum to his\nown manse, venture himself unprotected into such a scene of\nconfusion?--he might as well pretend to cross the Atlantic without a\npilot--I must push off in chase of him, lest worse come of it.\"\n\nBut the traveller was prevented from executing his friendly purpose by a\nsort of crowd which came rushing down the alley, the centre of which was\noccupied by Captain MacTurk, in the very act of bullying two pseudo\nHighlanders, for having presumed to lay aside their breeches before they\nhad acquired the Gaelic language. The sounds of contempt and insult with\nwhich the genuine Celt was overwhelming the unfortunate impostors, were\nnot, indeed, intelligible otherwise than from the tone and manner of the\nspeaker; but these intimated so much displeasure, that the plaided forms\nwhose unadvised choice of a disguise had provoked it--two raw lads from\na certain great manufacturing town--heartily repented their temerity,\nand were in the act of seeking for the speediest exit from the gardens;\nrather choosing to resign their share of the dinner, than to abide the\nfarther consequences that might follow from the displeasure of this\nhighland Termagant.\n\nTouchwood had scarcely extricated himself from this impediment, and\nagain commenced his researches after the clergyman, when his course was\nonce more interrupted by a sort of pressgang, headed by Sir Bingo Binks,\nwho, in order to play his character of a drunken boatswain to the life,\nseemed certainly drunk enough, however little of a seaman. His cheer\nsounded more like a view-hollo than a hail, when, with a volley of such\noaths as would have blown a whole fleet of the Bethel Union out of the\nwater, he ordered Touchwood \"to come under his lee, and be d----d; for,\nsmash his old timbers, he must go to sea again, for as weather-beaten a\nhulk as he was.\"\n\nTouchwood answered instantly, \"To sea with all my heart, but not with a\nland-lubber for commander.--Harkye, brother, do you know how much of a\nhorse's furniture belongs to a ship?\"\n\n\"Come, none of your quizzing, my old buck,\" said Sir Bingo--\"What the\ndevil has a ship to do with horse's furniture?--Do you think we belong\nto the horse-marines?--ha! ha! I think you're matched, brother.\"\n\n\"Why, you son of a fresh-water gudgeon,\" replied the traveller, \"that\nnever in your life sailed farther than the Isle of Dogs, do you pretend\nto play a sailor, and not know the bridle of the bow-line, and the\nsaddle of the boltsprit, and the bit for the cable, and the girth to\nhoist the rigging, and the whip to serve for small tackle?--There is a\ntrick for you to find out an Abram-man, and save sixpence when he begs\nof you as a disbanded seaman.--Get along with you! or the constable\nshall be charged with the whole pressgang to man the workhouse.\"\n\nA general laugh arose at the detection of the swaggering boatswain; and\nall that the Baronet had for it was to sneak off, saying, \"D--n the old\nquiz, who the devil thought to have heard so much slang from an old\nmuslin nightcap!\"\n\nTouchwood being now an object of some attention, was followed by two or\nthree stragglers, whom he endeavoured to rid himself of the best way he\ncould, testifying an impatience a little inconsistent with the decorum\nof his Oriental demeanour, but which arose from his desire to rejoin his\ncompanion, and some apprehension of inconvenience which he feared\nCargill might sustain during his absence. For, being in fact as\ngood-natured a man as any in the world, Mr. Touchwood was at the same\ntime one of the most conceited, and was very apt to suppose, that his\npresence, advice, and assistance, were of the most indispensable\nconsequence to those with whom he lived; and that not only on great\nemergencies, but even in the most ordinary occurrences of life.\n\nMeantime, Mr. Cargill, whom he sought in vain, was, on his part,\nanxiously keeping in sight of the beautiful Indian shawl, which served\nas a flag to announce to him the vessel which he held in chase. At\nlength he approached so close as to say, in an anxious whisper, \"Miss\nMowbray--Miss Mowbray--I must speak with you.\"\n\n\"And what would you have with Miss Mowbray?\" said the fair wearer of the\nbeautiful shawl, but without turning round her head.\n\n\"I have a secret--an important secret, of which to make you aware; but\nit is not for this place.--Do not turn from me!--Your happiness in this,\nand perhaps in the next life, depends on your listening to me.\"\n\nThe lady led the way, as if to give him an opportunity of speaking with\nher more privately, to one of those old-fashioned and deeply-embowered\nrecesses, which are commonly found in such gardens as that of\nShaws-Castle; and, with her shawl wrapped around her head, so as in some\ndegree to conceal her features, she stood before Mr. Cargill in the\ndoubtful light and shadow of a huge platanus tree, which formed the\ncanopy of the arbour, and seemed to await the communication he had\npromised.\n\n\"Report says,\" said the clergyman, speaking in an eager and hurried\nmanner, yet with a low voice, and like one desirous of being heard by\nher whom he addressed, and by no one else,--\"Report says that you are\nabout to be married.\"\n\n\"And is report kind enough to say to whom?\" answered the lady, with a\ntone of indifference which seemed to astound her interrogator.\n\n\"Young lady,\" he answered, with a solemn voice, \"had this levity been\nsworn to me, I could never have believed it! Have you forgot the\ncircumstances in which you stand?--Have you forgotten that my promise of\nsecrecy, sinful perhaps even in that degree, was but a conditional\npromise?--or did you think that a being so sequestered as I am was\nalready dead to the world, even while he was walking upon its\nsurface?--Know, young lady, that I am indeed dead to the pleasures and\nthe ordinary business of life, but I am even therefore the more alive to\nits duties.\"\n\n\"Upon my honour, sir, unless you are pleased to be more explicit, it is\nimpossible for me either to answer or understand you,\" said the lady;\n\"you speak too seriously for a masquerade pleasantry, and yet not\nclearly enough to make your earnest comprehensible.\"\n\n\"Is this sullenness, Miss Mowbray?\" said the clergyman, with increased\nanimation; \"Is it levity?--Or is it alienation of mind?--Even after a\nfever of the brain, we retain a recollection of the causes of our\nillness.--Come, you must and do understand me, when I say, that I will\nnot consent to your committing a great crime to attain temporal wealth\nand rank, no, not to make you an empress. My path is a clear one; and\nshould I hear a whisper breathed of your alliance with this Earl, or\nwhatever he may be, rely upon it, that I will withdraw the veil, and\nmake your brother, your bridegroom, and the whole world, acquainted with\nthe situation in which you stand, and the impossibility of your forming\nthe alliance which you propose to yourself, I am compelled to say,\nagainst the laws of God and man.\"\n\n\"But, sir--sir,\" answered the lady, rather eagerly than anxiously, \"you\nhave not yet told me what business you have with my marriage, or what\narguments you can bring against it.\"\n\n\"Madam,\" replied Mr. Cargill, \"in your present state of mind, and in\nsuch a scene as this, I cannot enter upon a topic for which the season\nis unfit, and you, I am sorry to say, are totally unprepared. It is\nenough that you know the grounds on which you stand. At a fitter\nopportunity, I will, as it is my duty, lay before you the enormity of\nwhat you are said to have meditated, with the freedom which becomes one,\nwho, however humble, is appointed to explain to his fellow-creatures the\nlaws of his Maker. In the meantime, I am not afraid that you will take\nany hasty step, after such a warning as this.\"\n\nSo saying, he turned from the lady with that dignity which a conscious\ndischarge of duty confers, yet, at the same time, with a sense of deep\npain, inflicted by the careless levity of her whom he addressed. She did\nnot any longer attempt to detain him, but made her escape from the\narbour by one alley, as she heard voices which seemed to approach it\nfrom another. The clergyman, who took the opposite direction, met in\nfull encounter a whispering and tittering pair, who seemed, at his\nsudden appearance, to check their tone of familiarity, and assume an\nappearance of greater distance towards each other. The lady was no other\nthan the fair Queen of the Amazons, who seemed to have adopted the\nrecent partiality of Titania towards Bully Bottom, being in conference\nsuch and so close as we have described, with the late representative of\nthe Athenian weaver, whom his recent visit to his chamber had\nmetamorphosed into the more gallant disguise of an ancient Spanish\ncavalier. He now appeared with cloak and drooping plume, sword, poniard,\nand guitar, richly dressed at all points, as for a serenade beneath his\nmistress's window; a silk mask at the breast of his embroidered doublet\nhung ready to be assumed in case of intrusion, as an appropriate part of\nthe national dress.\n\nIt sometimes happened to Mr. Cargill, as we believe it may chance to\nother men much subject to absence of mind, that, contrary to their wont,\nand much after the manner of a sunbeam suddenly piercing a deep mist,\nand illuminating one particular object in the landscape, some sudden\nrecollection rushes upon them, and seems to compel them to act under it,\nas under the influence of complete certainty and conviction. Mr. Cargill\nhad no sooner set eyes on the Spanish cavalier, in whom he neither knew\nthe Earl of Etherington, nor recognised Bully Bottom, than with hasty\nemotion he seized on his reluctant hand, and exclaimed, with a mixture\nof eagerness and solemnity, \"I rejoice to see you!--Heaven has sent you\nhere in its own good time.\"\n\n\"I thank you, sir,\" replied Lord Etherington, very coldly, \"I believe\nyou have the joy of the meeting entirely on your side, as I cannot\nremember having seen you before.\"\n\n\"Is not your name Bulmer?\" said the clergyman. \"I--I know--I am\nsometimes apt to make mistakes--But I am sure your name is Bulmer?\"\n\n\"Not that ever I or my godfathers heard of--my name was Bottom half an\nhour ago--perhaps that makes the confusion,\" answered the Earl, with\nvery cold and distant politeness;--\"Permit me to pass, sir, that I may\nattend the lady.\"\n\n\"Quite unnecessary,\" answered Lady Binks; \"I leave you to adjust your\nmutual recollections with your new old friend, my lord--he seems to have\nsomething to say.\" So saying, the lady walked on, not perhaps sorry of\nan opportunity to show apparent indifference for his lordship's society\nin the presence of one who had surprised them in what might seem a\nmoment of exuberant intimacy.\n\n\"You detain me, sir,\" said the Earl of Etherington to Mr. Cargill, who,\nbewildered and uncertain, still kept himself placed so directly before\nthe young nobleman, as to make it impossible for him to pass, without\nabsolutely pushing him to one side. \"I must really attend the lady,\" he\nadded, making another effort to walk on.\n\n\"Young man,\" said Mr. Cargill, \"you cannot disguise yourself from me. I\nam sure--my mind assures me, that you are that very Bulmer whom Heaven\nhath sent here to prevent crime.\"\n\n\"And you,\" said Lord Etherington, \"whom my mind assures me I never saw\nin my life, are sent hither by the devil, I think, to create confusion.\"\n\n\"I beg pardon, sir,\" said the clergyman, staggered by the calm and\npertinacious denial of the Earl--\"I beg pardon if I am in a\nmistake--that is, if I am _really_ in a mistake--but I am not--I am\nsure I am not!--That look--that smile--I am NOT mistaken. You _are_\nValentine Bulmer--the very Valentine Bulmer whom I--but I will not make\nyour private affairs any part of this exposition--enough, you _are_\nValentine Bulmer.\"\n\n\"Valentine?--Valentine?\" answered Lord Etherington, impatiently,--\"I am\nneither Valentine nor Orson--I wish you good-morning, sir.\"\n\n\"Stay, sir, stay, I charge you,\" said the clergyman; \"if you are\nunwilling to be known yourself, it may be because you have forgotten who\nI am--Let me name myself as the Reverend Josiah Cargill, minister of St.\nRonan's.\"\n\n\"If you bear a character so venerable, sir,\" replied the young\nnobleman,--\"in which, however, I am not in the least interested,--I\nthink when you make your morning draught a little too potent, it might\nbe as well for you to stay at home and sleep it off, before coming into\ncompany.\"\n\n\"In the name of Heaven, young gentleman,\" said Mr. Cargill, \"lay aside\nthis untimely and unseemly jesting! and tell me if you be not--as I\ncannot but still believe you to be--that same youth, who, seven years\nsince, left in my deposit a solemn secret, which, if I should unfold to\nthe wrong person, woe would be my own heart, and evil the consequences\nwhich might ensue!\"\n\n\"You are very pressing with me, sir,\" said the Earl; \"and, in exchange,\nI will be equally frank with you.--I am not the man whom you mistake me\nfor, and you may go seek him where you will--It will be still more lucky\nfor you if you chance to find your own wits in the course of your\nresearches; for I must tell you plainly, I think they are gone somewhat\nastray.\" So saying, with a gesture expressive of a determined purpose to\npass on, Mr. Cargill had no alternative but to make way, and suffer him\nto proceed.\n\nThe worthy clergyman stood as if rooted to the ground, and, with his\nusual habit of thinking aloud exclaimed to himself, \"My fancy has played\nme many a bewildering trick, but this is the most extraordinary of them\nall!--What can this young man think of me? It must have been my\nconversation with that unhappy young lady that has made such an\nimpression upon me as to deceive my very eyesight, and causes me to\nconnect with her history the face of the next person that I met--What\n_must_ the stranger think of me!\"\n\n\"Why, what every one thinks of thee that knows thee, prophet,\" said the\nfriendly voice of Touchwood, accompanying his speech with an awakening\nslap on the clergyman's shoulder; \"and that is, that thou art an\nunfortunate philosopher of Laputa, who has lost his flapper in the\nthrong.--Come along--having me once more by your side, you need fear\nnothing. Why, now I look at you closer, you look as if you had seen a\nbasilisk--not that there is any such thing, otherwise I must have seen\nit myself, in the course of my travels--but you seem pale and\nfrightened--What the devil is the matter?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" answered the clergyman, \"except that I have even this very\nmoment made an egregious fool of myself.\"\n\n\"Pooh, pooh, that is nothing to sigh over, prophet.--Every man does so\nat least twice in the four-and-twenty hours,\" said Touchwood.\n\n\"But I had nearly betrayed to a stranger, a secret deeply concerning the\nhonour of an ancient family.\"\n\n\"That was wrong, Doctor,\" said Touchwood; \"take care of that in future;\nand, indeed, I would advise you not to speak even to your beadle, Johnie\nTirlsneck, until you have assured yourself, by at least three pertinent\nquestions and answers, that you have the said Johnie corporeally and\nsubstantially in presence before you, and that your fancy has not\ninvested some stranger with honest Johnie's singed periwig and\nthreadbare brown joseph--Come along--come along.\"\n\nSo saying, he hurried forward the perplexed clergyman, who in vain made\nall the excuses he could think of in order to effect his escape from the\nscene of gaiety, in which he was so unexpectedly involved. He pleaded\nheadache; and his friend assured him that a mouthful of food, and a\nglass of wine, would mend it. He stated he had business; and Touchwood\nreplied that he could have none but composing his next sermon, and\nreminded him that it was two days till Sunday. At length, Mr. Cargill\nconfessed that he had some reluctance again to see the stranger, on whom\nhe had endeavoured with such pertinacity to fix an acquaintance, which\nhe was now well assured existed only in his own imagination. The\ntraveller treated his scruples with scorn, and said, that guests meeting\nin this general manner, had no more to do with each other than if they\nwere assembled in a caravansary.\n\n\"So that you need not say a word to him in the way of apology or\notherwise--or, what will be still better, I, who have seen so much of\nthe world, will make the pretty speech for you.\" As they spoke, he\ndragged the divine towards the house, where they were now summoned by\nthe appointed signal, and where the company were assembling in the old\nsaloon already noticed, previous to passing into the dining-room, where\nthe refreshments were prepared. \"Now, Doctor,\" continued the busy friend\nof Mr. Cargill, \"let us see which of all these people has been the\nsubject of your blunder. Is it yon animal of a Highlandman?--or the\nimpertinent brute that wants to be thought a boatswain?--or which of\nthem all is it?--Ay, here they come, two and two, Newgate fashion--the\nyoung Lord of the Manor with old Lady Penelope--does he set up for\nUlysses, I wonder?--The Earl of Etherington with Lady Bingo--methinks it\nshould have been with Miss Mowbray.\"\n\n\"The Earl of what, did you say?\" quoth the clergyman, anxiously. \"How is\nit you titled that young man in the Spanish dress?\"\n\n\"Oho!\" said the traveller; \"what, I have discovered the goblin that has\nscared you?--Come along--come along--I will make you acquainted with\nhim.\" So saying, he dragged him towards Lord Etherington; and before the\ndivine could make his negative intelligible, the ceremony of\nintroduction had taken place. \"My Lord Etherington, allow me to present\nMr. Cargill, minister of this parish--a learned gentleman, whose head is\noften in the Holy Land, when his person seems present among his friends.\nHe suffers extremely, my lord, under the sense of mistaking your\nlordship for the Lord knows who; but when you are acquainted with him,\nyou will find that he can make a hundred stranger mistakes than that, so\nwe hope that your lordship will take no prejudice or offence.\"\n\n\"There can be no offence taken where no offence is intended,\" said Lord\nEtherington, with much urbanity. \"It is I who ought to beg the reverend\ngentleman's pardon, for hurrying from him without allowing him to make a\ncomplete eclaircissement. I beg his pardon for an abruptness which the\nplace and the time--for I was immediately engaged in a lady's\nservice--rendered unavoidable.\"\n\nMr. Cargill gazed on the young nobleman as he pronounced these words,\nwith the easy indifference of one who apologizes to an inferior in order\nto maintain his own character for politeness, but with perfect\nindifference whether his excuses are or are not held satisfactory. And\nas the clergyman gazed, the belief which had so strongly clung to him\nthat the Earl of Etherington and young Valentine Bulmer were the same\nindividual person, melted away like frostwork before the morning sun,\nand that so completely, that he marvelled at himself for having ever\nentertained it. Some strong resemblance of features there must have been\nto have led him into such a delusion; but the person, the tone, the\nmanner of expression, were absolutely different; and his attention being\nnow especially directed towards these particulars, Mr. Cargill was\ninclined to think the two personages almost totally dissimilar.\n\nThe clergyman had now only to make his apology, and fall back from the\nhead of the table to some lower seat, which his modesty would have\npreferred, when he was suddenly seized upon by the Lady Penelope\nPenfeather, who, detaining him in the most elegant and persuasive manner\npossible, insisted that they should be introduced to each other by Mr.\nMowbray, and that Mr. Cargill should sit beside her at table.--She had\nheard so much of his learning--so much of his excellent\ncharacter--desired so much to make his acquaintance, that she could not\nthink of losing an opportunity, which Mr. Cargill's learned seclusion\nrendered so very rare--in a word, catching the Black Lion was the order\nof the day; and her ladyship having trapped her prey, soon sat\ntriumphant with him by her side.\n\nA second separation was thus effected betwixt Touchwood and his friend;\nfor the former, not being included in the invitation, or, indeed, at all\nnoticed by Lady Penelope, was obliged to find room at a lower part of\nthe table, where he excited much surprise by the dexterity with which he\ndispatched boiled rice with chop-sticks.\n\nMr. Cargill being thus exposed, without a consort, to the fire of Lady\nPenelope, speedily found it so brisk and incessant, as to drive his\ncomplaisance, little tried as it had been for many years by small talk,\nalmost to extremity. She began by begging him to draw his chair close,\nfor an instinctive terror of fine ladies had made him keep his distance.\nAt the same time, she hoped \"he was not afraid of her as an\nEpiscopalian; her father had belonged to that communion; for,\" she\nadded, with what was intended for an arch smile, \"we were somewhat\nnaughty in the forty-five, as you may have heard; but all that was over,\nand she was sure Mr. Cargill was too liberal to entertain any dislike or\nshyness on that score.--She could assure him she was far from disliking\nthe Presbyterian form--indeed she had often wished to hear it, where she\nwas sure to be both delighted and edified\" (here a gracious smile) \"in\nthe church of St. Ronan's--and hoped to do so whenever Mr. Mowbray had\ngot a stove, which he had ordered from Edinburgh, on purpose to air his\npew for her accommodation.\"\n\nAll this, which was spoken with wreathed smiles and nods, and so much\ncivility as to remind the clergyman of a cup of tea over-sweetened to\nconceal its want of strength, and flavour, required and received no\nfarther answer than an accommodating look and acquiescent bow.\n\n\"Ah, Mr. Cargill,\" continued the inexhaustible Lady Penelope, \"your\nprofession has so many demands on the heart as well as the\nunderstanding--is so much connected with the kindnesses and charities of\nour nature--with our best and purest feelings, Mr. Cargill! You know\nwhat Goldsmith says:--\n\n    ----'to his duty prompt at every call,\n    He watch'd, and wept, and felt, and pray'd for all.'\n\nAnd then Dryden has such a picture of a parish priest, so inimitable,\none would think, did we not hear now and then of some living mortal\npresuming to emulate its features,\" (here another insinuating nod and\nexpressive smile.)\n\n    \"'Refined himself to soul to curb the sense,\n    And almost made a sin of abstinence.\n    Yet had his aspect nothing of severe,\n    But such a face as promised him sincere;\n    Nothing reserved or sullen was to see,\n    But sweet regard and pleasing sanctity.'\"\n\nWhile her ladyship declaimed, the clergyman's wandering eye confessed\nhis absent mind; his thoughts travelling, perhaps, to accomplish a truce\nbetwixt Saladin and Conrade of Mountserrat, unless they chanced to be\noccupied with some occurrences of that very day, so that the lady was\nobliged to recall her indocile auditor with the leading question, \"You\nare well acquainted with Dryden, of course, Mr. Cargill?\"\n\n\"I have not the honour, madam,\" said Mr. Cargill, starting from his\nreverie, and but half understanding the question he replied to.\n\n\"Sir!\" said the lady in surprise.\n\n\"Madam!--my lady!\" answered Mr. Cargill, in embarrassment.\n\n\"I asked you if you admired Dryden;--but you learned men are so\nabsent--perhaps you thought I said Leyden.\"\n\n\"A lamp too early quenched, madam,\" said Mr Cargill; \"I knew him well.\"\n\n\"And so did I,\" eagerly replied the lady of the cerulean buskin; \"he\nspoke ten languages--how mortifying to poor me, Mr. Cargill, who could\nonly boast of five!--but I have studied a little since that time--I must\nhave you to help me in my studies, Mr. Cargill--it will be\ncharitable--but perhaps you are afraid of a female pupil?\"\n\nA thrill, arising from former recollections, passed through poor\nCargill's mind, with as much acuteness as the pass of a rapier might\nhave done through his body; and we cannot help remarking, that a forward\nprater in society, like a busy bustler in a crowd, besides all other\ngeneral points of annoyance, is eternally rubbing upon some tender\npoint, and galling men's feelings, without knowing or regarding it.\n\n\"You must assist me, besides, in my little charities, Mr. Cargill, now\nthat you and I are become so well acquainted.--There is that Anne\nHeggie--I sent her a trifle yesterday, but I am told--I should not\nmention it, but only one would not have the little they have to bestow\nlavished on an improper object--I am told she is not quite proper--an\nunwedded mother, in short, Mr. Cargill--and it would be especially\nunbecoming in me to encourage profligacy.\"\n\n\"I believe, madam,\" said the clergyman, gravely, \"the poor woman's\ndistress may justify your ladyship's bounty, even if her conduct has\nbeen faulty.\"\n\n\"O, I am no prude, neither, I assure you, Mr. Cargill,\" answered the\nLady Penelope. \"I never withdraw my countenance from any one but on the\nmost irrefragable grounds. I could tell you of an intimate friend of my\nown, whom I have supported against the whole clamour of the people at\nthe Well, because I believe, from the bottom of my soul, she is only\nthoughtless--nothing in the world but thoughtless--O Mr. Cargill, how\ncan you look across the table so intelligently?--who would have thought\nit of you?--Oh fie, to make such personal applications!\"\n\n\"Upon my word, madam, I am quite at a loss to comprehend\"----\n\n\"Oh fie, fie, Mr. Cargill,\" throwing in as much censure and surprise as\na confidential whisper can convey--\"you looked at my Lady Binks--I know\nwhat you think, but you are quite wrong, I assure you; you are entirely\nwrong.--I wish she would not flirt quite so much with that young Lord\nEtherington though, Mr. Cargill--her situation is particular.--Indeed, I\nbelieve she wears out his patience; for see he is leaving the room\nbefore we sit down--how singular!--And then, do you not think it very\nodd, too, that Miss Mowbray has not come down to us?\"\n\n\"Miss Mowbray!--what of Miss Mowbray--is she not here?\" said Mr.\nCargill, starting, and with an expression of interest which he had not\nyet bestowed on any of her ladyship's liberal communications.\n\n\"Ay, poor Miss Mowbray,\" said Lady Penelope, lowering her voice, and\nshaking her head; \"she has not appeared--her brother went up stairs a\nfew minutes since, I believe, to bring her down, and so we are all left\nhere to look at each other.--How very awkward!--But you know Clara\nMowbray.\"\n\n\"I, madam?\" said Mr. Cargill, who was now sufficiently attentive; \"I\nreally--I know Miss Mowbray--that is, I knew her some years since--but\nyour ladyship knows she has been long in bad health--uncertain health at\nleast, and I have seen nothing of the young lady for a very long time.\"\n\n\"I know it, my dear Mr. Cargill--I know it,\" continued the Lady\nPenelope, in the same tone of deep sympathy, \"I know it; and most\nunhappy surely have been the circumstances that have separated her from\nyour advice and friendly counsel.--All this I am aware of--and to say\ntruth, it has been chiefly on poor Clara's account that I have been\ngiving you the trouble of fixing an acquaintance upon you.--You and I\ntogether, Mr. Cargill, might do wonders to cure her unhappy state of\nmind--I am sure we might--that is, if you could bring your mind to\nrepose absolute confidence in me.\"\n\n\"Has Miss Mowbray desired your ladyship to converse with me upon any\nsubject which interests her?\" said the clergyman, with more cautious\nshrewdness than Lady Penelope had suspected him of possessing. \"I will\nin that case be happy to hear the nature of her communication; and\nwhatever my poor services can perform, your ladyship may command them.\"\n\n\"I--I--I cannot just assert,\" said her ladyship with hesitation, \"that I\nhave Miss Mowbray's direct instructions to speak to you, Mr. Cargill,\nupon the present subject. But my affection for the dear girl is so very\ngreat--and then, you know, the inconveniences which may arise from this\nmatch.\"\n\n\"From which match, Lady Penelope?\" said Mr. Cargill.\n\n\"Nay, now, Mr. Cargill, you really carry the privilege of Scotland too\nfar--I have not put a single question to you, but what you have answered\nby another--let us converse intelligibly for five minutes, if you can\nbut condescend so far.\"\n\n\"For any length of time which your ladyship may please to command,\" said\nMr. Cargill, \"provided the subject regard your ladyship's own affairs or\nmine,--could I suppose these last for a moment likely to interest you.\"\n\n\"Out upon you,\" said the lady, laughing affectedly; \"you should really\nhave been a Catholic priest instead of a Presbyterian. What an\ninvaluable father confessor have the fair sex lost in you, Mr. Cargill,\nand how dexterously you would have evaded any cross-examinations which\nmight have committed your penitents!\"\n\n\"Your ladyship's raillery is far too severe for me to withstand or reply\nto,\" said Mr. Cargill, bowing with more ease than her ladyship expected;\nand, retiring gently backward, he extricated himself from a conversation\nwhich he began to find somewhat embarrassing.\n\nAt that moment a murmur of surprise took place in the apartment, which\nwas just entered by Miss Mowbray, leaning on her brother's arm. The\ncause of this murmur will be best understood, by narrating what had\npassed betwixt the brother and sister.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III.\n\nEXPOSTULATION.\n\n    Seek not the feast in these irreverent robes;\n    Go to my chamber--put on clothes of mine.\n\n_The Taming of the Shrew._\n\n\nIt was with a mixture of anxiety, vexation, and resentment, that\nMowbray, just when he had handed Lady Penelope into the apartment where\nthe tables were covered, observed that his sister was absent, and that\nLady Binks was hanging on the arm of Lord Etherington, to whose rank it\nwould properly have fallen to escort the lady of the house. An anxious\nand hasty glance cast through the room, ascertained that she was absent,\nnor could the ladies present give any account of her after she had\nquitted the gardens, except that Lady Penelope had spoken a few words\nwith her in her own apartment, immediately after the scenic\nentertainment was concluded.\n\nThither Mowbray hurried, complaining aloud of his sister's laziness in\ndressing, but internally hoping that the delay was occasioned by nothing\nof a more important character.\n\nHe hastened up stairs, entered her sitting-room without ceremony, and\nknocking at the door of her dressing-room, begged her to make haste.\n\n\"Here is the whole company impatient,\" he said, assuming a tone of\npleasantry; \"and Sir Bingo Binks exclaiming for your presence, that he\nmay be let loose on the cold meat.\"\n\n\"Paddock calls,\" said Clara from within; \"anon--anon!\"\n\n\"Nay, it is no jest, Clara,\" continued her brother; \"for here is Lady\nPenelope miauling like a starved cat!\"\n\n\"I come--I come, greymalkin,\" answered Clara, in the same vein as\nbefore, and entered the parlour as she spoke, her finery entirely thrown\naside, and dressed in the riding-habit which was her usual and favourite\nattire.\n\nHer brother was both surprised and offended. \"On my soul,\" he said,\n\"Clara, this is behaving very ill. I indulge you in every freak upon\nordinary occasions, but you might surely on this day, of all others,\nhave condescended to appear something like my sister, and a gentlewoman\nreceiving company in her own house.\"\n\n\"Why, dearest John,\" said Clara, \"so that the guests have enough to eat\nand drink, I cannot conceive why I should concern myself about their\nfinery, or they trouble themselves about my plain clothes.\"\n\n\"Come, come, Clara, this will not do,\" answered Mowbray; \"you must\npositively go back into your dressing-room, and huddle your things on as\nfast as you can. You cannot go down to the company dressed as you are.\"\n\n\"I certainly can, and I certainly will, John--I have made a fool of\nmyself once this morning to oblige you, and for the rest of the day I am\ndetermined to appear in my own dress; that is, in one which shows I\nneither belong to the world, nor wish to have any thing to do with its\nfashions.\"\n\n\"By my soul, Clara, I will make you repent this!\" said Mowbray, with\nmore violence than he usually exhibited where his sister was concerned.\n\n\"You cannot, dear John,\" she coolly replied, \"unless by beating me; and\nthat I think you would repent of yourself.\"\n\n\"I do not know but what it were the best way of managing you,\" said\nMowbray, muttering between his teeth; but, commanding his violence, he\nonly said aloud, \"I am sure, from long experience, Clara, that your\nobstinacy will at the long run beat my anger. Do let us compound the\npoint for once--keep your old habit, since you are so fond of making a\nsight of yourself, and only throw the shawl round your shoulders--it has\nbeen exceedingly admired, and every woman in the house longs to see it\ncloser--they can hardly believe it genuine.\"\n\n\"Do be a man, Mowbray,\" answered his sister; \"meddle with your\nhorse-sheets, and leave shawls alone.\"\n\n\"Do you be a woman, Clara, and think a little on them, when custom and\ndecency render it necessary.--Nay, is it possible!--Will you not\nstir--not oblige me in such a trifle as this?\"\n\n\"I would indeed if I could,\" said Clara; \"but since you must know the\ntruth--do not be angry--I have not the shawl. I have given it\naway--given it up, perhaps I should say, to the rightful owner.--She has\npromised me something or other in exchange for it, however. I have given\nit to Lady Penelope.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Mowbray, \"some of the work of her own fair hands, I\nsuppose, or a couple of her ladyship's drawings, made up into\nfire-screens.--On my word--on my soul, this is too bad!--It is using me\ntoo ill, Clara--far too ill. If the thing had been of no value, my\ngiving it to you should have fixed some upon it.--Good-even to you; we\nwill do as well as we can without you.\"\n\n\"Nay, but, my dear John--stay but a moment,\" said Clara, taking his arm\nas he sullenly turned towards the door; \"there are but two of us on the\nearth--do not let us quarrel about a trumpery shawl.\"\n\n\"Trumpery!\" said Mowbray; \"It cost fifty guineas, by G--, which I can\nbut ill spare--trumpery!\"\n\n\"O, never think of the cost,\" said Clara; \"it was your gift, and that\nshould, I own, have been enough to have made me keep to my death's day\nthe poorest rag of it. But really Lady Penelope looked so very\nmiserable, and twisted her poor face into so many odd expressions of\nanger and chagrin, that I resigned it to her, and agreed to say she had\nlent it to me for the performance. I believe she was afraid that I would\nchange my mind, or that you would resume it as a seignorial waif; for,\nafter she had walked a few turns with it wrapped around her, merely by\nway of taking possession, she dispatched it by a special messenger to\nher apartment at the Well.\"\n\n\"She may go to the devil,\" said Mowbray, \"for a greedy unconscionable\njade, who has varnished over a selfish, spiteful heart, that is as hard\nas a flint, with a fine glossing of taste and sensibility!\"\n\n\"Nay, but, John,\" replied his sister, \"she really had something to\ncomplain of in the present case. The shawl had been bespoken on her\naccount, or very nearly so--she showed me the tradesman's letter--only\nsome agent of yours had come in between with the ready money, which no\ntradesman can resist.--Ah, John! I suspect half of your anger is owing\nto the failure of a plan to mortify poor Lady Pen, and that she has more\nto complain of than you have.--Come, come, you have had the advantage of\nher in the first display of this fatal piece of finery, if wearing it on\nmy poor shoulders can be called a display--e'en make her welcome to the\nrest for peace's sake, and let us go down to these good folks, and you\nshall see how pretty and civil I shall behave.\"\n\nMowbray, a spoiled child, and with all the petted habits of indulgence,\nwas exceedingly fretted at the issue of the scheme which he had formed\nfor mortifying Lady Penelope; but he saw at once the necessity of saying\nnothing more to his sister on the subject. Vengeance he privately\nmuttered against Lady Pen, whom he termed an absolute harpy in\nblue-stockings; unjustly forgetting, that in the very important affair\nat issue, he himself had been the first to interfere with and defeat her\nladyship's designs on the garment in question.\n\n\"But I will blow her,\" he said, \"I will blow her ladyship's conduct in\nthe business! She shall not outwit a poor whimsical girl like Clara,\nwithout hearing it on more sides than one.\"\n\nWith this Christian and gentlemanlike feeling towards Lady Penelope, he\nescorted his sister into the eating-room, and led her to her proper\nplace at the head of the table. It was the negligence displayed in her\ndress, which occasioned the murmur of surprise that greeted Clara on her\nentrance. Mowbray, as he placed his sister in her chair, made her\ngeneral apology for her late appearance, and her riding-habit. \"Some\nfairies,\" he supposed, \"Puck, or such like tricksy goblin, had been in\nher wardrobe, and carried off whatever was fit for wearing.\"\n\nThere were answers from every quarter--that it would have been too much\nto expect Miss Mowbray to dress for their amusement a second time--that\nnothing she chose to wear could misbecome Miss Mowbray--that she had set\nlike the sun, in her splendid scenic dress, and now rose like the full\nmoon in her ordinary attire, (this flight was by the Reverend Mr.\nChatterly,)--and that \"Miss Mowbray being at hame, had an unco gude\nright to please hersell;\" which last piece of politeness, being at least\nas much to the purpose as any that had preceded it, was the contribution\nof honest Mrs. Blower; and was replied to by Miss Mowbray with a\nparticular and most gracious bow.\n\nMrs. Blower ought to have rested her colloquial fame, as Dr. Johnson\nwould have said, upon a compliment so evidently acceptable, but no one\nknows where to stop. She thrust her broad, good-natured, delighted\ncountenance forward, and sending her voice from the bottom to the top of\nthe table, like her umquhile husband when calling to his mate during a\nbreeze, wondered \"why Miss Clara Moubrie didna wear that grand shawl she\nhad on at the play-making, and her just sitting upon the wind of a door.\nNae doubt it was for fear of the soup, and the butter-boats, and the\nlike;--but _she_ had three shawls, which she really fand was ane ower\nmony--if Miss Moubrie wad like to wear ane o' them--it was but\nimitashion, to be sure--but it wad keep her shouthers as warm as if it\nwere real Indian, and if it were dirtied it was the less matter.\"\n\n\"Much obliged, Mrs. Blower,\" said Mowbray unable to resist the\ntemptation which this speech offered; \"but my sister is not yet of\nquality sufficient, to entitle her to rob her friends of their shawls.\"\n\nLady Penelope coloured to the eyes, and bitter was the retort that arose\nto her tongue; but she suppressed it, and nodding to Miss Mowbray in the\nmost friendly way in the world, yet with a very particular expression,\nshe only said, \"So you have told your brother of the little transaction\nwhich we have had this morning?--_Tu me lo pagherai_--I give you fair\nwarning, take care none of your secrets come into my keeping--that's\nall.\"\n\nUpon what mere trifles do the important events of human life sometimes\ndepend! If Lady Penelope had given way to her first movements of\nresentment, the probable issue would have been some such half-comic\nhalf-serious skirmish, as her ladyship and Mr. Mowbray had often amused\nthe company withal. But revenge which is suppressed and deferred, is\nalways most to be dreaded; and to the effects of the deliberate\nresentment which Lady Penelope cherished upon this trifling occasion,\nmust be traced the events which our history has to record. Secretly did\nshe determine to return the shawl, which she had entertained hopes of\nmaking her own upon very reasonable terms; and as secretly did she\nresolve to be revenged both upon brother and sister, conceiving herself\nalready possessed, to a certain degree, of a clew to some part of their\nfamily history, which might serve for a foundation on which to raise her\nprojected battery. The ancient offences and emulation of importance of\nthe Laird of St. Ronan's, and the superiority which had been given to\nClara in the exhibition of the day, combined with the immediate cause of\nresentment; and it only remained for her to consider how her revenge\nshould be most signally accomplished.\n\nWhilst such thoughts were passing through Lady Penelope's mind, Mowbray\nwas searching with his eyes for the Earl of Etherington, judging that it\nmight be proper, in the course of the entertainment, or before the\nguests had separated, to make him formally acquainted with his sister,\nas a preface to the more intimate connexion which must, in prosecution\nof the plan agreed upon, take place betwixt them. Greatly to his\nsurprise, the young Earl was no where visible, and the place which he\nhad occupied by the side of Lady Binks had been quietly appropriated by\nWinterblossom, as the best and softest chair in the room, and nearest to\nthe head of the table, where the choicest of the entertainment is\nusually arranged. This honest gentleman, after a few insipid compliments\nto her ladyship upon her performance as Queen of the Amazons, had\nbetaken himself to the much more interesting occupation of ogling the\ndishes, through the glass which hung suspended at his neck by a gold\nchain of Maltese workmanship. After looking and wondering for a few\nseconds, Mowbray addressed himself to the old beau-gar\u00c3\u00a7on, and asked him\nwhat had become of Etherington.\n\n\"Retreated,\" said Winterblossom, \"and left but his compliments to you\nbehind him--a complaint, I think, in his wounded arm.--Upon my word,\nthat soup has a most appetizing flavour!--Lady Penelope, shall I have\nthe honour to help you?--no!--nor you, Lady Binks?--you are too\ncruel!--I must comfort myself, like a heathen priest of old, by eating\nthe sacrifice which the deities have scorned to accept of.\"\n\nHere he helped himself to the plate of soup which he had in vain offered\nto the ladies, and transferred the further duty of dispensing it to Mr.\nChatterly; \"it is your profession, sir, to propitiate the\ndivinities--ahem!\"\n\n\"I did not think Lord Etherington would have left us so soon,\" said\nMowbray; \"but we must do the best we can without his countenance.\"\n\nSo saying, he assumed his place at the bottom of the table, and did his\nbest to support the character of a hospitable and joyous landlord, while\non her part, with much natural grace, and delicacy of attention\ncalculated to set every body at their ease, his sister presided at the\nupper end of the board. But the vanishing of Lord Etherington in a\nmanner so sudden and unaccountable--the obvious ill-humour of Lady\nPenelope--and the steady, though passive, sullenness of Lady Binks,\nspread among the company a gloom like that produced by an autumnal mist\nupon a pleasing landscape. The women were low-spirited, dull, nay,\npeevish, they did not well know why; and the men could not be joyous,\nthough the ready resource of old hock and champagne made some of them\ntalkative.--Lady Penelope broke up the party by well-feigned\napprehension of the difficulties, nay, dangers, of returning by so rough\na road. Lady Binks begged a seat with her ladyship, as Sir Bingo, she\nsaid, judging from his devotion to the green flask, was likely to need\ntheir carriage home. From the moment of their departure, it became bad\ntone to remain behind; and all, as in a retreating army, were eager to\nbe foremost, excepting MacTurk and a few stanch topers, who, unused to\nmeet with such good cheer every day of their lives, prudently determined\nto make the most of the opportunity.\n\nWe will not dwell on the difficulties attending the transportation of a\nlarge company by few carriages, though the delay and disputes thereby\noccasioned were of course more intolerable than in the morning, for the\nparties had no longer the hopes of a happy day before them, as a bribe\nto submit to temporary inconvenience. The impatience of many was so\ngreat, that, though the evening was raw, they chose to go on foot rather\nthan await the dull routine of the returning carriages; and as they\nretired they agreed, with one consent, to throw the blame of whatever\ninconvenience they might sustain on their host and hostess, who had\ninvited so large a party before getting a shorter and better road made\nbetween the Well and Shaws-Castle.\n\n\"It would have been so easy to repair the path by the Buck-stane!\"\n\nAnd this was all the thanks which Mr. Mowbray received for an\nentertainment which had cost him so much trouble and expense, and had\nbeen looked forward to by the good society at the Well with such\nimpatient expectation.\n\n\"It was an unco pleasant show,\" said the good-natured Mrs. Blower, \"only\nit was a pity it was sae tediousome; and there was surely an awfu' waste\nof gauze and muslin.\"\n\nBut so well had Dr. Quackleben improved his numerous opportunities, that\nthe good lady was much reconciled to affairs in general, by the prospect\nof coughs, rheumatisms, and other maladies acquired upon the occasion,\nwhich were likely to afford that learned gentleman, in whose prosperity\nshe much interested herself, a very profitable harvest.\n\nMowbray, somewhat addicted to the service of Bacchus, did not find\nhimself freed, by the secession of so large a proportion of the company,\nfrom the service of the jolly god, although, upon the present occasion,\nhe could well have dispensed with his orgies. Neither the song, nor the\npun, nor the jest, had any power to kindle his heavy spirit, mortified\nas he was by the event of his party being so different from the\nbrilliant consummation which he had anticipated. The guests, stanch boon\ncompanions, suffered not, however, their party to flag for want of the\nlandlord's participation, but continued to drink bottle after bottle,\nwith as little regard for Mr. Mowbray's grave looks, as if they had been\ncarousing at the Mowbray Arms, instead of the Mowbray mansion-house.\nMidnight at length released him, when, with an unsteady step, he sought\nhis own apartment; cursing himself and his companions, consigning his\nown person with all dispatch to his bed, and bequeathing those of the\ncompany to as many mosses and quagmires, as could be found betwixt\nShaws-Castle and St. Ronan's Well.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nTHE PROPOSAL.\n\n    Oh! you would be a vestal maid, I warrant,\n    The bride of Heaven--Come--we may shake your purpose;\n    For here I bring in hand a jolly suitor\n    Hath ta'en degrees in the seven sciences\n    That ladies love best--He is young and noble,\n    Handsome and valiant, gay, and rich, and liberal.\n\n_The Nun._\n\n\nThe morning after a debauch is usually one of reflection, even to the\nmost determined boon companion; and, in the retrospect of the preceding\nday, the young Laird of St. Ronan's saw nothing very consolatory, unless\nthat the excess was not, in the present case, of his own seeking, but\nhad arisen out of the necessary duties of a landlord, or what were\nconsidered as such by his companions.\n\nBut it was not so much his dizzy recollections of the late carouse which\nhaunted him on awakening, as the inexplicability which seemed to shroud\nthe purposes and conduct of his new ally, the Earl of Etherington.\n\nThat young nobleman had seen Miss Mowbray, had declared his high\nsatisfaction, had warmly and voluntarily renewed the proposal which he\nhad made ere she was yet known to him--and yet, far from seeking an\nopportunity to be introduced to her, he had even left the party\nabruptly, in order to avoid the necessary intercourse which must there\nhave taken place between them. His lordship's flirtation with Lady\nBinks had not escaped the attention of the sagacious Mowbray--her\nladyship also had been in a hurry to leave Shaws-Castle; and Mowbray\npromised to himself to discover the nature of this connexion through\nMrs. Gingham, her ladyship's attendant, or otherwise; vowing deeply at\nthe same time, that no peer in the realm should make an affectation of\naddressing Miss Mowbray a cloak for another and more secret intrigue.\nBut his doubts on this subject were in great measure removed by the\narrival of one of Lord Etherington's grooms with the following letter:--\n\n    \"My Dear Mowbray,--You would naturally be surprised at my escape\n    from the table yesterday before you returned to it, or your lovely\n    sister had graced it with her presence. I must confess my folly; and\n    I may do so the more boldly, for, as the footing on which I first\n    opened this treaty was not a very romantic one, you will scarce\n    suspect me of wishing to render it such. But I did in reality feel,\n    during the whole of yesterday, a reluctance which I cannot express,\n    to be presented to the lady on whose favour the happiness of my\n    future life is to depend, upon such a public occasion, and in the\n    presence of so promiscuous a company. I had my mask, indeed, to wear\n    while in the promenade, but, of course, that was to be laid aside at\n    table, and, consequently, I must have gone through the ceremony of\n    introduction; a most interesting moment, which I was desirous to\n    defer till a fitter season. I trust you will permit me to call upon\n    you at Shaws-Castle this morning, in the hope--the anxious hope--of\n    being allowed to pay my duty to Miss Mowbray, and apologize for not\n    waiting upon her yesterday. I expect your answer with the utmost\n    impatience, being always yours, &c. &c. &c.\n\n\"ETHERINGTON.\"\n\n\"This,\" said St. Ronan's to himself, as he folded the letter\ndeliberately, after having twice read it over, \"seems all fair and above\nboard; I could not wish any thing more explicit; and, moreover, it puts\ninto black and white, as old Mick would say, what only rested before on\nour private conversation. An especial cure for the headache, such a\nbillet as this in a morning.\"\n\nSo saying, he sat him down and wrote an answer, expressing the pleasure\nhe should have in seeing his lordship as soon as he thought proper. He\nwatched even the departure of the groom, and beheld him gallop off, with\nthe speed of one who knows that his quick return was expected by an\nimpatient master.\n\nMowbray remained for a few minutes by himself, and reflected with\ndelight upon the probable consequences of this match;--the advancement\nof his sister--and, above all, the various advantages which must\nnecessarily accrue to himself, by so close an alliance with one whom he\nhad good reason to think deep _in the secret_, and capable of rendering\nhim the most material assistance in his speculations on the turf and in\nthe sporting world. He then sent a servant to let Miss Mowbray know that\nhe intended to breakfast with her.\n\n\"I suppose, John,\" said Clara, as her brother entered the apartment,\n\"you are glad of a weaker cup this morning than those you were drinking\nlast night--you were carousing till after the first cock.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mowbray, \"that sandbed, old MacTurk, upon whom whole\nhogsheads make no impression, did make a bad boy of me--but the day is\nover, and they will scarce catch me in such another scrape.--What did\nyou think of the masks?\"\n\n\"Supported as well,\" said Clara, \"as such folk support the disguise of\ngentlemen and ladies during life; and that is, with a great deal of\nbustle, and very little propriety.\"\n\n\"I saw only one good mask there, and that was a Spaniard,\" said her\nbrother.\n\n\"O, I saw him too,\" answered Clara; \"but he wore his visor on. An old\nIndian merchant, or some such thing, seemed to me a better\ncharacter--the Spaniard did nothing but stalk about and twangle his\nguitar, for the amusement of my Lady Binks, as I think.\"\n\n\"He is a very clever fellow, though, that same Spaniard,\" rejoined\nMowbray--\"Can you guess who he is?\"\n\n\"No, indeed; nor shall I take the trouble of trying. To set to guessing\nabout it, were as bad as seeing the whole mummery over again.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied her brother, \"you will allow one thing at least--Bottom\nwas well acted--you cannot deny that.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" replied Clara, \"that worthy really deserved to wear his ass's\nhead to the end of the chapter--but what of him?\"\n\n\"Only conceive that he should be the very same person with that handsome\nSpaniard,\" replied Mowbray.\n\n\"Then there is one fool fewer than I thought there was,\" replied Clara,\nwith the greatest indifference.\n\nHer brother bit his lip.\n\n\"Clara,\" he said, \"I believe you are an excellent good girl, and clever\nto boot, but pray do not set up for wit and oddity; there is nothing in\nlife so intolerable as pretending to think differently from other\npeople.--That gentleman was the Earl of Etherington.\"\n\nThis annunciation, though made in what was meant to be an imposing tone,\nhad no impression on Clara.\n\n\"I hope he plays the peer better than the Fidalgo,\" she replied,\ncarelessly.\n\n\"Yes,\" answered Mowbray, \"he is one of the handsomest men of the time,\nand decidedly fashionable--you will like him much when you see him in\nprivate.\"\n\n\"It is of little consequence whether I do or no,\" answered Clara.\n\n\"You mistake the matter,\" said Mowbray, gravely; \"it may be of\nconsiderable consequence.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\" said Clara, with a smile; \"I must suppose myself, then, too\nimportant a person not to make my approbation necessary to one of your\nfirst-rates? He cannot pretend to pass muster at St. Ronan's without\nit?--Well, I will depute my authority to Lady Binks, and she shall pass\nyour new recruits instead of me.\"\n\n\"This is all nonsense, Clara,\" said Mowbray. \"Lord Etherington calls\nhere this very morning, and wishes to be made known to you. I expect you\nwill receive him as a particular friend of mine.\"\n\n\"With all my heart--so you will engage, after this visit, to keep him\ndown with your other particular friends at the Well--you know it is a\nbargain that you bring neither buck nor pointer into my parlour--the one\nworries my cat, and the other my temper.\"\n\n\"You mistake me entirely, Clara--this is a very different visitor from\nany I have ever introduced to you--I expect to see him often here, and\nI hope you and he will be better friends than you think of. I have more\nreasons for wishing this, than I have now time to tell you.\"\n\nClara remained silent for an instant, then looked at her brother with an\nanxious and scrutinizing glance, as if she wished to penetrate into his\ninmost purpose.\n\n\"If I thought,\"--she said, after a minute's consideration, and with an\naltered and disturbed tone; \"but no--I will not think that Heaven\nintends me such a blow--least of all, that it should come from your\nhands.\" She walked hastily to the window, and threw it open--then shut\nit again, and returned to her seat, saying, with a constrained smile,\n\"May Heaven forgive you, brother, but you frightened me heartily.\"\n\n\"I did not mean to do so, Clara,\" said Mowbray, who saw the necessity of\nsoothing her; \"I only alluded in joke to those chances that are never\nout of other girls' heads, though you never seem to calculate on them.\"\n\n\"I wish you, my dear John,\" said Clara, struggling to regain entire\ncomposure, \"I wish _you_ would profit by my example, and give up the\nscience of chance also--it will not avail you.\"\n\n\"How d'ye know that?--I'll show you the contrary, you silly wench,\"\nanswered Mowbray--\"Here is a banker's bill, payable to your own order,\nfor the cash you lent me, and something over--don't let old Mick have\nthe fingering, but let Bindloose manage it for you--he is the honester\nman between two d----d knaves.\"\n\n\"Will not you, brother, send it to the man Bindloose yourself?\"\n\n\"No,--no,\" replied Mowbray--\"he might confuse it with some of my\ntransactions, and so you forfeit your stake.\"\n\n\"Well, I am glad you are able to pay me, for I want to buy Campbell's\nnew work.\"\n\n\"I wish you joy of your purchase--but don't scratch me for not caring\nabout it--I know as little of books as you of the long odds. And come\nnow, be serious, and tell me if you will be a good girl--lay aside your\nwhims, and receive this English young nobleman like a lady as you are?\"\n\n\"That were easy,\" said Clara--\"but--but--Pray, ask no more of me than\njust to see him.--Say to him at once, I am a poor creature in body, in\nmind, in spirits, in temper, in understanding--above all, say that I can\nreceive him only once.\"\n\n\"I shall say no such thing,\" said Mowbray, bluntly; \"it is good to be\nplain with you at once--I thought of putting off this discussion--but\nsince it must come, the sooner it is over the better.--You are to\nunderstand, Clara Mowbray, that Lord Etherington has a particular view\nin this visit, and that his view has my full sanction and approbation.\"\n\n\"I thought so,\" said Clara, in the same altered tone of voice in which\nshe had before spoken; \"my mind foreboded this last of misfortunes!--But,\nMowbray, you have no child before you--I neither will nor can see this\nnobleman.\"\n\n\"How!\" exclaimed Mowbray, fiercely; \"do you dare return me so peremptory\nan answer?--Think better of it, for, if we differ, you will find you\nwill have the worst of the game.\"\n\n\"Rely upon it,\" she continued, with more vehemence, \"I will see him nor\nno man upon the footing you mention--my resolution is taken, and\nthreats and entreaties will prove equally unavailing.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, madam,\" said Mowbray, \"you have, for a modest and retired\nyoung lady, plucked up a goodly spirit of your own!--But you shall find\nmine equals it. If you do not agree to see my friend Lord Etherington,\nay, and to receive him with the politeness due to the consideration I\nentertain for him, by Heaven! Clara, I will no longer regard you as my\nfather's daughter. Think what you are giving up--the affection and\nprotection of a brother--and for what?--merely for an idle point of\netiquette.--You cannot, I suppose, even in the workings of your romantic\nbrain, imagine that the days of Clarissa Harlowe and Harriet Byron are\ncome back again, when women were married by main force? and it is\nmonstrous vanity in you to suppose that Lord Etherington, since he has\nhonoured you with any thoughts at all, will not be satisfied with a\nproper and civil refusal--You are no such prize, methinks, that the days\nof romance are to come back for you.\"\n\n\"I care not what days they are,\" said Clara--\"I tell you I will not see\nLord Etherington, or any one else, upon such preliminaries as you have\nstated--I cannot--I will not--and I ought not.--Had you meant me to\nreceive him, which can be a matter of no consequence whatever, you\nshould have left him on the footing of an ordinary visitor--as it is, I\nwill not see him.\"\n\n\"You _shall_ see and hear him both,\" said Mowbray; \"you shall find me as\nobstinate as you are--as willing to forget I am a brother, as you to\nforget that you have one.\"\n\n\"It is time, then,\" replied Clara, \"that this house, once our father's,\nshould no longer hold us both. I can provide for myself, and may God\nbless you!\"\n\n\"You take it coolly, madam,\" said her brother, walking through the\napartment with much anxiety both of look and gesture.\n\n\"I do,\" she answered, \"for it is what I have often foreseen--Yes,\nbrother, I have often foreseen that you would make your sister the\nsubject of your plots and schemes, so soon as other stakes failed you.\nThat hour is come, and I am, as you see, prepared to meet it.\"\n\n\"And where may you propose to retire to?\" said Mowbray. \"I think that I,\nyour only relation and natural guardian, have a right to know that--my\nhonour and that of my family is concerned.\"\n\n\"Your honour!\" she retorted, with a keen glance at him; \"your interest,\nI suppose you mean, is somehow connected with the place of my\nabode.--But keep yourself patient--the den of the rock, the linn of the\nbrook, should be my choice, rather than a palace without my freedom.\"\n\n\"You are mistaken, however,\" said Mowbray, sternly, \"if you hope to\nenjoy more freedom than I think you capable of making a good use of. The\nlaw authorizes, and reason, and even affection, require, that you should\nbe put under restraint for your own safety, and that of your character.\nYou roamed the woods a little too much in my father's time, if all\nstories be true.\"\n\n\"I did--I did indeed, Mowbray,\" said Clara, weeping; \"God pity me, and\nforgive you for upbraiding me with my state of mind--I know I cannot\nsometimes trust my own judgment; but is it for you to remind me of\nthis?\"\n\nMowbray was at once softened and embarrassed.\n\n\"What folly is this?\" he said; \"you say the most cutting things to\nme--are ready to fly from my house--and when I am provoked to make an\nangry answer, you burst into tears!\"\n\n\"Say you did not mean what you said, my dearest brother!\" exclaimed\nClara; \"O say you did not mean it!--Do not take my liberty from me--it\nis all I have left, and, God knows, it is a poor comfort in the sorrows\nI undergo. I will put a fair face on every thing--will go down to the\nWell--will wear what you please, and say what you please--but O! leave\nme the liberty of my solitude here--let me weep alone in the house of my\nfather--and do not force a broken-hearted sister to lay her death at\nyour door.--My span must be a brief one, but let not your hand shake the\nsand-glass!--Disturb me not--let me pass quietly--I do not ask this so\nmuch for my sake as for your own. I would have you think of me,\nsometimes, Mowbray, after I am gone, and without the bitter reflections\nwhich the recollection of harsh usage will assuredly bring with it. Pity\nme, were it but for your own sake.--I have deserved nothing but\ncompassion at your hand--There are but two of us on earth, why should we\nmake each other miserable?\"\n\nShe accompanied these entreaties with a flood of tears, and the most\nheart-bursting sobs. Mowbray knew not what to determine. On the one\nhand, he was bound by his promise to the Earl; on the other, his sister\nwas in no condition to receive such a visitor; nay, it was most\nprobable, that if he adopted the strong measure of compelling her to\nreceive him, her behaviour would probably be such as totally to break\noff the projected match, on the success of which he had founded so many\ncastles in the air. In this dilemma, he had again recourse to argument.\n\n\"Clara,\" he said, \"I am, as I have repeatedly said, your only relation\nand guardian--if there be any real reason why you ought not to receive,\nand, at least, make a civil reply to such a negotiation as the Earl of\nEtherington has thought fit to open, surely I ought to be intrusted with\nit. You enjoyed far too much of that liberty which you seem to prize so\nhighly during my father's lifetime--in the last years of it at\nleast--have you formed any foolish attachment during that time, which\nnow prevents you from receiving such a visit as Lord Etherington has\nthreatened?\"\n\n\"Threatened!--the expression is well chosen,\" said Miss Mowbray; \"and\nnothing can be more dreadful than such a threat, excepting its\naccomplishment.\"\n\n\"I am glad your spirits are reviving,\" replied her brother; \"but that is\nno answer to my question.\"\n\n\"Is it necessary,\" said Clara, \"that one must have actually some\nengagement or entanglement, to make them unwilling to be given in\nmarriage, or even to be pestered upon such a subject?--Many young men\ndeclare they intend to die bachelors, why may not I be permitted to\ncommence old maid at three-and-twenty?--Let me do so, like a kind\nbrother, and there were never nephews and nieces so petted and so\nscolded, so nursed and so cuffed by a maiden aunt, as your children,\nwhen you have them, shall be by aunt Clara.\"\n\n\"And why not say all this to Lord Etherington?\" said Mowbray; \"wait\nuntil he propose such a terrible bugbear as matrimony, before you refuse\nto receive him. Who knows, the whim that he hinted at may have passed\naway--he was, as you say, flirting with Lady Binks, and her ladyship has\na good deal of address, as well as beauty.\"\n\n\"Heaven improve both, (in an honest way,) if she will but keep his\nlordship to herself!\" said Clara.\n\n\"Well, then,\" continued her brother, \"things standing thus, I do not\nthink you will have much trouble with his lordship--no more, perhaps,\nthan just to give him a civil denial. After having spoken on such a\nsubject to a man of my condition, he cannot well break off without you\ngive him an apology.\"\n\n\"If that is all,\" said Clara, \"he shall, as soon as he gives me an\nopportunity, receive such an answer as will leave him at liberty to woo\nany one whatsoever of Eve's daughters, excepting Clara Mowbray. Methinks\nI am so eager to set the captive free, that I now wish as much for his\nlordship's appearance as I feared it a little while since.\"\n\n\"Nay, nay, but let us go fair and softly,\" said her brother. \"You are\nnot to refuse him before he asks the question.\"\n\n\"Certainly,\" said Clara; \"but I well know how to manage that--he shall\nnever ask the question at all. I will restore Lady Binks's admirer,\nwithout accepting so much as a civility in ransom.\"\n\n\"Worse and worse, Clara,\" answered Mowbray; \"you are to remember he is\nmy friend and guest, and he must not be affronted in my house. Leave\nthings to themselves.--Besides, consider an instant, Clara--had you not\nbetter take a little time for reflection in this case? The offer is a\nsplendid one--title--fortune--and, what is more, a fortune which you\nwill be well entitled to share largely in.\"\n\n\"This is beyond our implied treaty,\" said Clara. \"I have yielded more\nthan ever I thought I should have done, when I agreed that this Earl\nshould be introduced to me on the footing of a common visitor; and now\nyou talk favourably of his pretensions. This is an encroachment,\nMowbray, and now I shall relapse into my obstinacy, and refuse to see\nhim at all.\"\n\n\"Do as you will,\" replied Mowbray, sensible that it was only by working\non her affections that he had any chance of carrying a point against her\ninclination,--\"Do as you will, my dear Clara; but, for Heaven's sake,\nwipe your eyes.\"\n\n\"And behave myself,\" said she, trying to smile as she obeyed\nhim,--\"behave myself, you would say, like folks of this world; but the\nquotation is lost on you, who never read either Prior or Shakspeare.\"\n\n\"I thank Heaven for that,\" said Mowbray. \"I have enough to burden my\nbrain, without carrying such a lumber of rhymes in it as you and Lady\nPen do.--Come, that is right; go to the mirror, and make yourself\ndecent.\"\n\nA woman must be much borne down indeed by pain and suffering, when she\nloses all respect for her external appearance. The madwoman in Bedlam\nwears her garland of straw with a certain air of pretension; and we have\nseen a widow whom we knew to be most sincerely affected by a recent\ndeprivation, whose weeds, nevertheless, were arranged with a dolorous\ndegree of grace, which amounted almost to coquetry. Clara Mowbray had\nalso, negligent as she seemed to be of appearances, her own art of the\ntoilet, although of the most rapid and most simple character. She took\noff her little riding-hat, and, unbinding a lace of Indian gold which\nretained her locks, shook them in dark and glossy profusion over her\nvery handsome form, which they overshadowed down to her slender waist;\nand while her brother stood looking on her with a mixture of pride,\naffection, and compassion, she arranged them with a large comb, and,\nwithout the assistance of any _femme d'atours_, wove them, in the course\nof a few minutes, into such a natural head-dress as we see on the\nstatues of the Grecian nymphs.\n\n\"Now let me but find my best muff,\" she said, \"come prince and peer, I\nshall be ready to receive them.\"\n\n\"Pshaw! your muff--who has heard of such a thing these twenty years?\nMuffs were out of fashion before you were born.\"\n\n\"No matter, John,\" replied his sister; \"when a woman wears a muff,\nespecially a determined old maid like myself, it is a sign she has no\nintentions to scratch; and therefore the muff serves all the purposes of\na white flag, and prevents the necessity of drawing on a glove, so\nprudentially recommended by the motto of our cousins, the\nM'Intoshes.\"[II-4]\n\n\"Be it as you will, then,\" said Mowbray; \"for other than you do will it,\nyou will not suffer it to be.--But how is this!--another billet?--We are\nin request this morning.\"\n\n\"Now, Heaven send his lordship may have judiciously considered all the\nrisks which he is sure to encounter on this charmed ground, and resolved\nto leave his adventure unattempted,\" said Miss Mowbray.\n\nHer brother glanced a look of displeasure at her, as he broke the seal\nof the letter, which was addressed to him with the words, \"Haste and\nsecrecy,\" written on the envelope. The contents, which greatly surprised\nhim, we remit to the commencement of the next chapter.\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[II-4] The well known crest of this ancient race, is a cat rampant with a\nmotto bearing the caution--\"Touch not the cat, but [_i.e._ _be out_, or\nwithout] the glove.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V.\n\nPRIVATE INFORMATION.\n\n    ----Ope this letter;\n    I can produce a champion that will prove\n    What is avouched there.----\n\n_King Lear._\n\n\nThe billet which Mowbray received, and read in his sister's presence,\ncontained these words:--\n\n    \"Sir,--Clara Mowbray has few friends--none, perhaps, excepting\n    yourself, in right of blood, and the writer of this letter, by right\n    of the fondest, truest, and most disinterested attachment, that ever\n    man bore to woman. I am thus explicit with you, because, though it\n    is unlikely that I should ever again see or speak to your sister, I\n    am desirous that you should be clearly acquainted with the cause of\n    that interest, which I must always, even to my dying breath, take in\n    her affairs.\n\n    \"The person, calling himself Lord Etherington, is, I am aware, in\n    the neighbourhood of Shaws-Castle, with the intention of paying his\n    addresses to Miss Mowbray; and it is easy for me to foresee, arguing\n    according to the ordinary views of mankind, that he may place his\n    proposals in such a light as may make them seem highly desirable.\n    But ere you give this person the encouragement which his offers may\n    seem to deserve, please to enquire whether his fortune is certain,\n    or his rank indisputable; and be not satisfied with light evidence\n    on either point. A man may be in possession of an estate and title,\n    to which he has no better right than his own rapacity and\n    forwardness of assumption; and supposing Mr. Mowbray jealous, as he\n    must be, of the honour of his family, the alliance of such a one\n    cannot but bring disgrace. This comes from one who will make good\n    what he has written.\"\n\nOn the first perusal of a billet so extraordinary, Mowbray was inclined\nto set it down to the malice of some of the people at the Well,\nanonymous letters being no uncommon resource of the small wits who\nfrequent such places of general resort, as a species of deception safely\nand easily executed, and well calculated to produce much mischief and\nconfusion. But upon closer consideration, he was shaken in this opinion,\nand, starting suddenly from the reverie into which he had fallen, asked\nfor the messenger who had brought the letter. \"He was in the hall,\" the\nservant thought, and Mowbray ran to the hall. No--the messenger was not\nthere, but Mowbray might see his back as he walked up the avenue.--He\nhollo'd--no answer was returned--he ran after the fellow, whose\nappearance was that of a countryman. The man quickened his pace as he\nsaw himself pursued, and when he got out of the avenue, threw himself\ninto one of the numerous bypaths which wanderers, who strayed in quest\nof nuts, or for the sake of exercise, had made in various directions\nthrough the extensive copse which surrounded the Castle, and were\ndoubtless the reason of its acquiring the name of Shaws, which\nsignifies, in the Scottish dialect, a wood of this description.\n\nIrritated by the man's obvious desire to avoid him, and naturally\nobstinate in all his resolutions, Mowbray pursued for a considerable\nway, until he fairly lost breath; and the flier having been long out of\nsight, he recollected at length that his engagement with the Earl of\nEtherington required his attendance at the Castle.\n\nThe young lord, indeed, had arrived at Shaws-Castle, so few minutes\nafter Mowbray's departure, that it was wonderful they had not met in the\navenue. The servant to whom he applied, conceiving that his master must\nreturn instantly, as he had gone out without his hat, ushered the Earl,\nwithout farther ceremony, into the breakfast-room, where Clara was\nseated upon one of the window-seats, so busily employed with a book, or\nperhaps with her own thoughts while she held a book in her hands, that\nshe scarce raised her head, until Lord Etherington, advancing,\npronounced the words, \"Miss Mowbray.\" A start, and a loud scream,\nannounced her deadly alarm, and these were repeated as he made one pace\nnearer, and in a firmer accent said, \"Clara.\"\n\n\"No nearer--no nearer,\" she exclaimed, \"if you would have me look upon\nyou and live!\" Lord Etherington remained standing, as if uncertain\nwhether to advance or retreat, while with incredible rapidity she poured\nout her hurried entreaties that he would begone, sometimes addressing\nhim as a real personage, sometimes, and more frequently, as a delusive\nphantom, the offspring of her own excited imagination. \"I knew it,\" she\nmuttered, \"I knew what would happen, if my thoughts were forced into\nthat fearful channel.--Speak to me, brother! speak to me while I have\nreason left, and tell me that what stands before me is but an empty\nshadow! But it is no shadow--it remains before me in all the lineaments\nof mortal substance!\"\n\n\"Clara,\" said the Earl, with a firm, yet softened voice, \"collect and\ncompose yourself. I am, indeed, no shadow--I am a much-injured man, come\nto demand rights which have been unjustly withheld from me. I am now\narmed with power as well as justice, and my claims shall be heard.\"\n\n\"Never--never!\" replied Clara Mowbray; \"since extremity is my portion,\nlet extremity give me courage.--You have no rights--none--I know you\nnot, and I defy you.\"\n\n\"Defy me not, Clara Mowbray,\" answered the Earl, in a tone, and with a\nmanner how different from those which delighted society! for now he was\nsolemn, tragic, and almost stern, like the judge when he passes sentence\nupon a criminal. \"Defy me not,\" he repeated. \"I am your Fate, and it\nrests with you to make me a kind or severe one.\"\n\n\"Dare you speak thus?\" said Clara, her eyes flashing with anger, while\nher lips grew white, and quivered for fear--\"Dare you speak thus, and\nremember that the same heaven is above our heads, to which you so\nsolemnly vowed you would never see me more without my own consent?\"\n\n\"That vow was conditional--Francis Tyrrel, as he calls himself, swore\nthe same--hath _he_ not seen you?\" He fixed a piercing look on her; \"He\nhas--you dare not disown it!--And shall an oath, which to him is but a\ncobweb, be to me a shackle of iron?\"\n\n\"Alas! it was but for a moment,\" said Miss Mowbray, sinking in courage,\nand drooping her head as she spoke.\n\n\"Were it but the twentieth part of an instant--the least conceivable\nspace of subdivided time--still, you _did_ meet--he saw you--you spoke\nto him. And me also you must see--me also you must hear! Or I will first\nclaim you for my own in the face of the world; and, having vindicated my\nrights, I will seek out and extinguish the wretched rival who has dared\nto interfere with them.\"\n\n\"Can you speak thus?\" said Clara--\"can you so burst through the ties of\nnature?--Have you a heart!\"\n\n\"I have; and it shall be moulded like wax to your slightest wishes, if\nyou agree to do me justice; but not granite, nor aught else that nature\nhas of hardest, will be more inflexible if you continue an useless\nopposition!--Clara Mowbray, I am your Fate.\"\n\n\"Not so, proud man,\" said Clara, rising, \"God gave not one potsherd the\npower to break another, save by his divine permission--my fate is in the\nwill of Him, without whose will even a sparrow falls not to the\nground.--Begone--I am strong in faith of heavenly protection.\"\n\n\"Do you speak thus in sincerity?\" said the Earl of Etherington;\n\"consider first what is the prospect before you. I stand here in no\ndoubtful or ambiguous character--I offer not the mere name of a\nhusband--propose to you not a humble lot of obscurity and hardship, with\nfears for the past and doubts for the future; yet there _was_ a time\nwhen to a suit like this you could listen favourably.--I stand high\namong the nobles of the country, and offer you, as my bride, your share\nin my honours, and in the wealth which becomes them.--Your brother is my\nfriend, and favours my suit. I will raise from the ground, and once more\nrender illustrious, your ancient house--your motions shall be regulated\nby your wishes, even by your caprices--I will even carry my self-denial\nso far, that you shall, should you insist on so severe a measure, have\nyour own residence, your own establishment, and without intrusion on my\npart, until the most devoted love, the most unceasing attentions, shall\nmake way on your inflexible disposition.--All this I will consent to for\nthe future--all that is past shall be concealed from the public.--But\nmine, Clara Mowbray, you must be.\"\n\n\"Never--never!\" she said with increasing vehemence. \"I can but repeat a\nnegative, but it shall have all the force of an oath.--Your rank is\nnothing to me--your fortune I scorn--my brother has no right, by the law\nof Scotland, or of nature, to compel my inclinations.--I detest your\ntreachery, and I scorn the advantage you propose to attain by\nit.--Should the law give you my hand, it would but award you that of a\ncorpse.\"\n\n\"Alas! Clara,\" said the Earl, \"you do but flutter in the net; but I will\nurge you no farther, now--there is another encounter before me.\"\n\nHe was turning away, when Clara, springing forward, caught him by the\narm, and repeated, in a low and impressive voice, the commandment,--\"Thou\nshalt do no murder!\"\n\n\"Fear not any violence,\" he said, softening his voice, and attempting to\ntake her hand, \"but what may flow from your own severity.--Francis is\nsafe from me, unless you are altogether unreasonable.--Allow me but what\nyou cannot deny to any friend of your brother, the power of seeing you\nat times--suspend at least the impetuosity of your dislike to me, and I\nwill, on my part, modify the current of my just and otherwise\nuncontrollable resentment.\"\n\nClara, extricating herself, and retreating from him, only replied,\n\"There is a Heaven above us, and THERE shall be judged our actions\ntowards each other! You abuse a power most treacherously obtained--you\nbreak a heart that never did you wrong--you seek an alliance with a\nwretch who only wishes to be wedded to her grave.--If my brother brings\nyou hither, I cannot help it--and if your coming prevents bloody and\nunnatural violence, it is so far well.--But by my consent you come\n_not_; and, were the choice mine, I would rather be struck with\nlife-long blindness, than that my eyes should again open on your\nperson--rather that my ears were stuffed with the earth of the grave,\nthan that they should again hear your voice!\"\n\nThe Earl of Etherington smiled proudly, and replied, \"Even this, madam,\nI can hear without resentment. Anxious and careful as you are to deprive\nyour compliance of every grace and of every kindness, I receive the\npermission to wait on you, as I interpret your words.\"\n\n\"Do not so interpret them,\" she replied; \"I do but submit to your\npresence as an unavoidable evil. Heaven be my witness, that, were it not\nto prevent greater and more desperate evil, I would not even so far\nacquiesce.\"\n\n\"Let acquiescence, then, be the word,\" he said; \"and so thankful will I\nbe, even for your acquiescence, Miss Mowbray, that all shall remain\nprivate, which I conceive you do not wish to be disclosed; and, unless\nabsolutely compelled to it in self-defence, you may rely, no violence\nwill be resorted to by me in any quarter.--I relieve you from my\npresence.\"\n\nSo saying, he withdrew from the apartment.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI.\n\nEXPLANATORY.\n\n    ----By your leave, gentle wax.\n\nSHAKSPEARE.\n\n\nIn the hall of Shaws-Castle the Earl of Etherington met Mowbray,\nreturned from his fruitless chase after the bearer of the anonymous\nepistle before recited; and who had but just learned, on his return,\nthat the Earl of Etherington was with his sister. There was a degree of\nmutual confusion when they met; for Mowbray had the contents of the\nanonymous letter fresh in his mind, and Lord Etherington,\nnotwithstanding all the coolness which he had endeavoured to maintain,\nhad not gone through the scene with Clara without discomposure. Mowbray\nasked the Earl whether he had seen his sister, and invited him, at the\nsame time, to return to the parlour; and his lordship replied, in a tone\nas indifferent as he could assume, that he had enjoyed the honour of the\nlady's company for several minutes, and would not now intrude farther\nupon Miss Mowbray's patience.\n\n\"You have had such a reception as was agreeable, my lord, I trust?\" said\nMowbray. \"I hope Clara did the honours of the house with propriety\nduring my absence?\"\n\n\"Miss Mowbray seemed a little fluttered with my sudden appearance,\" said\nthe Earl; \"the servant showed me in rather abruptly; and, circumstanced\nas we were, there is always awkwardness in a first meeting, where there\nis no third party to act as master of the ceremonies.--I suspect, from\nthe lady's looks, that you have not quite kept my secret, my good\nfriend. I myself, too, felt a little consciousness in approaching Miss\nMowbray--but it is over now; and, the ice being fairly broken, I hope to\nhave other and more convenient opportunities to improve the advantage I\nhave just gained in acquiring your lovely sister's personal\nacquaintance.\"\n\n\"So be it,\" said Mowbray; \"but, as you declare for leaving the castle\njust now, I must first speak a single word with your lordship, for which\nthis place is not altogether convenient.\"\n\n\"I can have no objections, my dear Jack,\" said Etherington, following\nhim with a thrill of conscious feeling, somewhat perhaps like that of\nthe spider when he perceives his deceitful web is threatened with\ninjury, and sits balanced in the centre, watching every point, and\nuncertain which he may be called upon first to defend. Such is one part,\nand not the slightest part, of the penance which never fails to wait on\nthose, who, abandoning the \"fair play of the world,\" endeavour to work\nout their purposes by a process of deception and intrigue.\n\n\"My lord,\" said Mowbray, when they had entered a little apartment, in\nwhich the latter kept his guns, fishing-tackle, and other implements of\nsport, \"you have played on the square with me; nay, more--I am bound to\nallow you have given me great odds. I am therefore not entitled to hear\nany reports to the prejudice of your lordship's character, without\ninstantly communicating them. There is an anonymous letter which I have\njust received. Perhaps your lordship may know the hand, and thus be\nenabled to detect the writer.\"\n\n\"I do know the hand,\" said the Earl, as he received the note from\nMowbray; \"and, allow me to say, it is the only one which could have\ndared to frame any calumny to my prejudice. I hope, Mr. Mowbray, it is\nimpossible for you to consider this infamous charge as any thing but a\nfalsehood?\"\n\n\"My placing it in your lordship's hands, without farther enquiry, is a\nsufficient proof that I hold it such, my lord; at the same time that I\ncannot doubt for a moment that your lordship has it in your power to\noverthrow so frail a calumny by the most satisfactory evidence.\"\n\n\"Unquestionably I can, Mr. Mowbray,\" said the Earl; \"for, besides my\nbeing in full possession of the estate and title of my father, the late\nEarl of Etherington, I have my father's contract of marriage, my own\ncertificate of baptism, and the evidence of the whole country, to\nestablish my right. All these shall be produced with the least delay\npossible. You will not think it surprising that one does not travel with\nthis sort of documents in one's post-chaise.\"\n\n\"Certainly not, my lord,\" said Mowbray; \"it is sufficient they are\nforthcoming when called for. But, may I enquire, my lord, who the writer\nof this letter is, and whether he has any particular spleen to gratify\nby this very impudent assertion, which is so easily capable of being\ndisproved?\"\n\n\"He is,\" said Etherington, \"or, at least, has the reputation of being, I\nam sorry to say, a near--a very near relation of my own--in fact, a\nbrother by the father's side, but illegitimate.--My father was fond of\nhim--I loved him also, for he has uncommonly fine parts, and is\naccounted highly accomplished. But there is a strain of something\nirregular in his mind--a vein, in short, of madness, which breaks out in\nthe usual manner, rendering the poor young man a dupe to vain\nimaginations of his own dignity and grandeur, which is perhaps the most\nordinary effect of insanity, and inspiring the deepest aversion against\nhis nearest relatives, and against myself in particular. He is a man\nextremely plausible, both in speech and manners; so much so, that many\nof my friends think there is more vice than insanity in the\nirregularities which he commits; but I may, I hope, be forgiven, if I\nhave formed a milder judgment of one supposed to be my father's son.\nIndeed, I cannot help being sorry for poor Frank, who might have made a\nvery distinguished figure in the world.\"\n\n\"May I ask the gentleman's name, my lord?\" said Mowbray.\n\n\"My father's indulgence gave him our family name of Tyrrel, with his own\nChristian name Francis; but his proper name, to which alone he has a\nright, is Martigny.\"\n\n\"Francis Tyrrel!\" exclaimed Mowbray; \"why, that is the name of the very\nperson who made some disturbance at the Well just before your lordship\narrived.--You may have seen an advertisement--a sort of placard.\"\n\n\"I have, Mr. Mowbray,\" said the Earl. \"Spare me on that subject, if you\nplease--it has formed a strong reason why I did not mention my connexion\nwith this unhappy man before; but it is no unusual thing for persons,\nwhose imaginations are excited, to rush into causeless quarrels, and\nthen to make discreditable retreats from them.\"\n\n\"Or,\" said Mr. Mowbray, \"he may have, after all, been prevented from\nreaching the place of rendezvous--it was that very day on which your\nlordship, I think, received your wound; and, if I mistake not, you hit\nthe man from whom you got the hurt.\"\n\n\"Mowbray,\" said Lord Etherington, lowering his voice, and taking him by\nthe arm, \"it is true that I did so--and truly glad I am to observe,\nthat, whatever might have been the consequences of such an accident,\nthey cannot have been serious.--It struck me afterwards, that the man by\nwhom I was so strangely assaulted, had some resemblance to the\nunfortunate Tyrrel--but I had not seen him for years.--At any rate, he\ncannot have been much hurt, since he is now able to resume his intrigues\nto the prejudice of my character.\"\n\n\"Your lordship views the thing with a firm eye,\" said Mowbray; \"firmer\nthan I think most people would be able to command, who had so narrow a\nchance of a scrape so uncomfortable.\"\n\n\"Why, I am, in the first place, by no means sure that the risk existed,\"\nsaid the Earl of Etherington; \"for, as I have often told you, I had but\na very transient glimpse of the ruffian; and, in the second place, I\n_am_ sure that no permanent bad consequences have ensued. I am too old a\nfox-hunter to be afraid of a leap after it is cleared, as they tell of\nthe fellow who fainted in the morning at the sight of the precipice he\nhad clambered over when he was drunk on the night before. The man who\nwrote that letter,\" touching it with his finger, \"is alive, and able to\nthreaten me; and if he did come to any hurt from my hand, it was in the\nact of attempting my life, of which I shall carry the mark to my\ngrave.\"\n\n\"Nay, I am far from blaming your lordship,\" said Mowbray, \"for what you\ndid in self-defence, but the circumstance might have turned out very\nunpleasant.--May I ask what you intend to do with this unfortunate\ngentleman, who is in all probability in the neighbourhood?\"\n\n\"I must first discover the place of his retreat,\" said Lord Etherington,\n\"and then consider what is to be done both for his safety, poor fellow,\nand my own. It is probable, too, that he may find sharpers to prey upon\nwhat fortune he still possesses, which, I assure you, is sufficient to\nattract a set of folk, who may ruin while they humour him.--May I beg\nthat you, too, will be on the outlook, and let me know if you hear or\nsee more of him?\"\n\n\"I shall, most certainly, my lord,\" answered Mowbray; \"but the only one\nof his haunts which I know, is the old Cleikum Inn, where he chose to\ntake up his residence. He has now left it, but perhaps the old crab-fish\nof a landlady may know something of him.\"\n\n\"I will not fail to enquire,\" said Lord Etherington; and, with these\nwords, he took a kind farewell of Mowbray, mounted his horse, and rode\nup the avenue.\n\n\"A cool fellow,\" said Mowbray, as he looked after him, \"a d--d cool\nfellow, this brother-in-law of mine, that is to be--takes a shot at his\nfather's son with as little remorse as at a blackcock--what would he do\nwith me, were we to quarrel?--Well, I can snuff a candle, and strike out\nthe ace of hearts; and so, should things go wrong, he has no Jack Raw to\ndeal with, but Jack Mowbray.\"\n\nMeanwhile the Earl of Etherington hastened home to his own apartments at\nthe Hotel; and, not entirely pleased with the events of the day,\ncommenced a letter to his correspondent, agent, and confidant, Captain\nJekyl, which we have fortunately the means of presenting to our\nreaders.--\n\n    \"Friend Harry,--They say a falling house is best known by the rats\n    leaving it--a falling state, by the desertion of confederates and\n    allies--and a falling man, by the desertion of his friends. If this\n    be true augury; your last letter may be considered as ominous of my\n    breaking down. Methinks, you have gone far enough, and shared deep\n    enough with me, to have some confidence in my _savoir faire_--some\n    little faith both in my means and management. What crossgrained\n    fiend has at once inspired you with what I suppose you wish me to\n    call politic doubts and scruples of conscience, but which I can only\n    regard as symptoms of fear and disaffection? You can have no idea of\n    'duels betwixt relations so nearly connected'--and 'the affair seems\n    very delicate and intricate'--and again, 'the matter has never been\n    fully explained to you'--and, moreover, 'if you are expected to take\n    an active part in the business, it must be when you are honoured\n    with my full and unreserved confidence, otherwise how could you be\n    of the use to me which I might require?' Such are your expressions.\n\n    \"Now, as to scruples of conscience about near relations, and so\n    forth, all that has blown by without much mischief, and certainly is\n    not likely to occur again--besides, did you never hear of friends\n    quarrelling before? And are they not to exercise the usual\n    privileges of gentlemen when they do? Moreover, how am I to know\n    that this plaguy fellow _is_ actually related to me?--They say it is\n    a wise child knows its own father; and I cannot be expected wise\n    enough to know to a certainty my father's son.--So much for\n    relationship.--Then, as to full and unreserved confidence--why,\n    Harry, this is just as if I were to ask you to look at a watch, and\n    tell what it was o'clock, and you were to reply, that truly you\n    could not inform me, because you had not examined the springs, the\n    counter-balances, the wheels, and the whole internal machinery of\n    the little timepiece.--But the upshot of the whole is this. Harry\n    Jekyl, who is as sharp a fellow as any other, thinks he has his\n    friend Lord Etherington at a dead lock, and that he knows already so\n    much of the said noble lord's history as to oblige his lordship to\n    tell him the whole. And perhaps he not unreasonably concludes, that\n    the custody of a whole secret is more creditable, and probably more\n    lucrative, than that of a half one; and, in short,--he is resolved\n    to make the most of the cards in his hand. Another, mine honest\n    Harry, would take the trouble to recall to your mind past times and\n    circumstances, and conclude with expressing a humble opinion, that\n    if Harry Jekyl were asked _now_ to do any service for the noble lord\n    aforesaid, Harry had got his reward in his pocket aforehand. But I\n    do not argue thus, because I would rather be leagued with a friend\n    who assists me with a view to future profit, than from respect to\n    benefits already received. The first lies like the fox's scent when\n    on his last legs, increasing every moment; the other is a\n    back-scent, growing colder the longer you follow it, until at last\n    it becomes impossible to puzzle it out. I will, therefore, submit to\n    circumstances, and tell you the whole story, though somewhat\n    tedious, in hopes that I can conclude with such a trail as you will\n    open upon breast-high.\n\n    \"Thus then it was.--Francis, fifth Earl of Etherington, and my\n    much-honoured father, was what is called a very eccentric man--that\n    is, he was neither a wise man nor a fool--had too much sense to walk\n    into a well, and yet in some of the furious fits which he was\n    visited with, I have seen him quite mad enough to throw any one\n    else into it.--Men said there was a lurking insanity--but it is an\n    ill bird, &c., and I will say no more about it. This shatterbrained\n    peer was, in other respects, a handsome accomplished man, with an\n    expression somewhat haughty, yet singularly pleasing when he chose\n    it--a man, in short, who might push his fortune with the fair sex.\n\n    \"Lord Etherington, such as I have described him, being upon his\n    travels in France, formed an attachment of the heart--ay, and some\n    have pretended, of the hand also, with a certain beautiful orphan,\n    Marie de Martigny. Of this union is said to have sprung (for I am\n    determined not to be certain on that point) that most incommodious\n    person, Francis Tyrrel, as he calls himself, but as I would rather\n    call him, Francis Martigny; the latter suiting my views, as perhaps\n    the former name agrees better with his pretensions. Now, I am too\n    good a son to subscribe to the alleged regularity of the marriage\n    between my right honourable and very good lord father, because my\n    said right honourable and very good lord did, on his return to\n    England, become wedded, in the face of the church, to my very\n    affectionate and well-endowed mother, Ann Bulmer of Bulmer-hall,\n    from which happy union sprung I, Francis Valentine Bulmer Tyrrel,\n    lawful inheritor of my father and mother's joint estates, as I was\n    the proud possessor of their ancient names. But the noble and\n    wealthy pair, though blessed with such a pledge of love as myself,\n    lived mighty ill together, and the rather, when my right honourable\n    father, sending for this other Sosia, this unlucky Francis Tyrrel,\n    senior, from France, insisted, in the face of propriety, that he\n    should reside in his house, and share, in all respects, in the\n    opportunities of education by which the real Sosia, Francis\n    Valentine Bulmer Tyrrel, then commonly called Lord Oakendale, hath\n    profited in such an uncommon degree.\n\n    \"Various were the matrimonial quarrels which arose between the\n    honoured lord and lady, in consequence of this unseemly conjunction\n    of the legitimate and illegitimate; and to these, we, the subjects\n    of the dispute, were sometimes very properly, as well as decorously,\n    made the witnesses. On one occasion, my right honourable mother, who\n    was a free-spoken lady, found the language of her own rank quite\n    inadequate to express the strength of her generous feelings, and\n    borrowing from the vulgar two emphatic words, applied them to Marie\n    de Martigny, and her son Francis Tyrrel. Never did Earl that ever\n    wore coronet fly into a pitch of more uncontrollable rage, than did\n    my right honourable father: and in the ardour of his reply, he\n    adopted my mother's phraseology, to inform her, that if there _was_\n    a whore and bastard connected with his house, it was herself and her\n    brat.\n\n    \"I was even then a sharp little fellow, and was incredibly struck\n    with the communication, which, in this hour of ungovernable\n    irritation, had escaped my right honourable father. It is true, he\n    instantly gathered himself up again; and, he perhaps recollecting\n    such a word as _bigamy_, and my mother, on her side, considering the\n    consequences of such a thing as a descent from the Countess of\n    Etherington into Mrs. Bulmer, neither wife, maid, nor widow, there\n    was an apparent reconciliation between them, which lasted for some\n    time. But the speech remained deeply imprinted on my remembrance;\n    the more so, that once, when I was exerting over my friend Francis\n    Tyrrel, the authority of a legitimate brother, and Lord Oakendale,\n    old Cecil, my father's confidential valet, was so much scandalized,\n    as to intimate a possibility that we might one day change\n    conditions. These two accidental communications seemed to me a key\n    to certain long lectures, with which my father used to regale us\n    boys, but me in particular, upon the extreme mutability of human\n    affairs,--the disappointment of the best-grounded hopes and\n    expectations,--and the necessity of being so accomplished in all\n    useful branches of knowledge, as might, in case of accidents, supply\n    any defalcation in our rank and fortune;--as if any art or science\n    could make amends for the loss of an Earldom, and twelve thousand\n    a-year! All this prosing seemed to my anxious mind designed to\n    prepare me for some unfortunate change; and when I was old enough to\n    make such private enquiries as lay in my power, I became still more\n    persuaded that my right honourable father nourished some thoughts of\n    making an honest woman of Marie de Martigny, and a legitimate elder\n    brother of Francis, after his death at least, if not during his\n    life. I was the more convinced of this, when a little affair, which\n    I chanced to have with the daughter of my Tu----, drew down my\n    father's wrath upon me in great abundance, and occasioned my being\n    banished to Scotland, along with my brother, under a very poor\n    allowance, without introductions, except to one steady, or call it\n    rusty, old Professor, and with the charge that I should not assume\n    the title of Lord Oakendale, but content myself with my maternal\n    grandfather's name of Valentine Bulmer, that of Francis Tyrrel being\n    pre-occupied.\n\n    \"Upon this occasion, notwithstanding the fear which I entertained of\n    my father's passionate temper, I did venture to say, that since I\n    was to resign my title, I thought I had a right to keep my family\n    name, and that my brother might take his mother's. I wish you had\n    seen the look of rage with which my father regarded me when I gave\n    him this spirited hint. 'Thou art,' he said, and paused, as if to\n    find out the bitterest epithet to supply the blank--'thou art thy\n    mother's child, and her perfect picture'--(this seemed the severest\n    reproach that occurred to him.)--'Bear her name then, and bear it\n    with patience and in secrecy; or, I here give you my word, you shall\n    never bear another the whole days of your life.' This sealed my\n    mouth with a witness; and then, in allusion to my flirtation with\n    the daughter of my Tu---- aforesaid, he enlarged on the folly and\n    iniquity of private marriages, warned me that in the country I was\n    going to, the matrimonial noose often lies hid under flowers, and\n    that folks find it twitched round their neck when they least expect\n    such a cravat; assured me, that he had very particular views for\n    settling Francis and me in life, and that he would forgive neither\n    of us who should, by any such rash entanglements, render them\n    unavailing.\n\n    \"This last minatory admonition was the more tolerable, that my rival\n    had his share of it; and so we were bundled off to Scotland, coupled\n    up like two pointers in a dog-cart, and--I can speak for one at\n    least--with much the same uncordial feelings towards each other. I\n    often, indeed, detected Francis looking at me with a singular\n    expression, as of pity and anxiety, and once or twice he seemed\n    disposed to enter on something respecting the situation in which we\n    stood towards each other; but I felt no desire to encourage his\n    confidence. Meantime, as we were called, by our father's directions,\n    not brothers, but cousins, so we came to bear towards each other the\n    habits of companionship, though scarcely of friendship. What Francis\n    thought, I know not; for my part, I must confess, that I lay by on\n    the watch for some opportunity when I might mend my own situation\n    with my father, though at the prejudice of my rival. And Fortune,\n    while she seemed to prevent such an opportunity, involved us both in\n    one of the strangest and most entangled mazes that her capricious\n    divinityship ever wove, and out of which I am even now struggling,\n    by sleight or force, to extricate myself. I can hardly help\n    wondering, even yet, at the odd conjunction, which has produced such\n    an intricacy of complicated incidents.\n\n    \"My father was a great sportsman, and Francis and I had both\n    inherited his taste for field-sports; but I in a keener and more\n    ecstatic degree. Edinburgh, which is a tolerable residence in winter\n    and spring, becomes disagreeable in summer, and in autumn is the\n    most melancholy _sejour_ that ever poor mortals were condemned to.\n    No public places are open, no inhabitant of any consideration\n    remains in the town; those who cannot get away, hide themselves in\n    obscure corners, as if ashamed to be seen in the streets. The gentry\n    go to their country-houses--the citizens to their sea-bathing\n    quarters--the lawyers to their circuits--the writers to visit their\n    country clients--and all the world to the moors to shoot grouse. We,\n    who felt the indignity of remaining in town during this deserted\n    season, obtained, with some difficulty, permission from the Earl to\n    betake ourselves to any obscure corner, and shoot grouse, if we\n    could get leave to do so on our general character of English\n    students at the University of Edinburgh, without quoting any thing\n    more.\n\n    \"The first year of our banishment we went to the neighbourhood of\n    the Highlands; but finding our sport interrupted by gamekeepers and\n    their gillies, on the second occasion we established ourselves at\n    this little village of St. Ronan's, where there were then no Spa, no\n    fine people, no card tables, no quizzes, excepting the old quiz of a\n    landlady with whom we lodged. We found the place much to our mind;\n    the old landlady had interest with some old fellow, agent of a\n    non-residing nobleman, who gave us permission to sport over his\n    moors, of which I availed myself keenly, and Francis with more\n    moderation. He was, indeed, of a grave musing sort of habit, and\n    often preferred solitary walks, in the wild and beautiful scenery\n    with which the village is surrounded, to the use of the gun. He was\n    attached to fishing, moreover, that dullest of human amusements, and\n    this also tended to keep us considerably apart. This gave me rather\n    pleasure than concern;--not that I hated Francis at that time; nay,\n    not that I greatly disliked his society; but merely because it was\n    unpleasant to be always with one, whose fortunes I looked upon as\n    standing in direct opposition to my own. I also rather despised the\n    indifference about sport, which indeed seemed to grow upon him; but\n    my gentleman had better taste than I was aware of. If he sought no\n    grouse on the hill, he had flushed a pheasant in the wood.\n\n    \"Clara Mowbray, daughter of the Lord of the more picturesque than\n    wealthy domain of St. Ronan's, was at that time scarce sixteen years\n    old, and as wild and beautiful a woodland nymph as the imagination\n    can fancy--simple as a child in all that concerned the world and its\n    ways, acute as a needle in every point of knowledge which she had\n    found an opportunity of becoming acquainted with; fearing harm from\n    no one, and with, a lively and natural strain of wit, which brought\n    amusement and gaiety wherever she came. Her motions were under no\n    restraint, save that of her own inclination; for her father, though\n    a cross, peevish, old man, was confined to his chair with the gout,\n    and her only companion, a girl of somewhat inferior caste, bred up\n    in the utmost deference to Miss Mowbray's fancies, served for\n    company indeed in her strolls through the wild country on foot and\n    on horseback, but never thought of interfering with her will and\n    pleasure.\n\n    \"The extreme loneliness of the country, (at that time,) and the\n    simplicity of its inhabitants, seemed to render these excursions\n    perfectly safe. Francis, happy dog, became the companion of the\n    damsels on such occasions through the following accident. Miss\n    Mowbray had dressed herself and her companion like country wenches,\n    with a view to surprise the family of one of their better sort of\n    farmers. They had accomplished their purpose greatly to their\n    satisfaction, and were hying home after sunset, when they were\n    encountered by a country fellow--a sort of Harry Jekyl in his\n    way--who, being equipped with a glass or two of whisky, saw not the\n    nobility of blood through her disguise, and accosted the daughter of\n    a hundred sires as he would have done a ewe-milker. Miss Mowbray\n    remonstrated--her companion screamed--up came cousin Francis with a\n    fowlingpiece on his shoulder, and soon put the sylvan to flight.\n\n    \"This was the beginning of an acquaintance, which had gone great\n    lengths before I found it out. The fair Clara, it seems, found it\n    safer to roam in the woods with an escort than alone, and my\n    studious and sentimental relative was almost her constant companion.\n    At their age, it was likely that some time might pass ere they came\n    to understand each other; but full confidence and intimacy was\n    established between them ere I heard of their amour.\n\n    \"And here, Harry, I must pause till next morning, and send you the\n    conclusion under a separate cover. The rap which I had over the\n    elbow the other day, is still tingling at the end of my fingers, and\n    you must not be critical with my manuscript.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII.\n\nLETTER CONTINUED.\n\n    --------Must I then ravel out\n    My weaved-up follies?--------\n\nSHAKSPEARE.\n\n\n    \"I resume my pen, Harry, to mention, without attempting to describe\n    my surprise, that Francis, compelled by circumstances, made me the\n    confidant of his love-intrigue. My grave cousin in love, and very\n    much in the mind of approaching the perilous verge of clandestine\n    marriage--he who used every now and then, not much to the\n    improvement of our cordial regard, to lecture me upon filial duty,\n    just upon the point of slipping the bridle himself! I could not for\n    my life tell whether surprise, or a feeling of mischievous\n    satisfaction, was predominant. I tried to talk to him as he used to\n    talk to me; but I had not the gift of persuasion, or he the power of\n    understanding the words of wisdom. He insisted our situation was\n    different--that his unhappy birth, as he termed it, freed him at\n    least from dependence on his father's absolute will--that he had, by\n    bequest from some relative of his mother, a moderate competence,\n    which Miss Mowbray had consented to share with him; in fine, that he\n    desired not my counsel but my assistance. A moment's consideration\n    convinced me, that I should be unkind, not to him only, but to\n    myself, unless I gave him all the backing I could in this his most\n    dutiful scheme. I recollected our right honourable father's\n    denunciations against Scottish marriages, and secret marriages of\n    all sorts,--denunciations perhaps not the less vehement, that he\n    might feel some secret prick of conscience on the subject himself. I\n    remembered that my grave brother had always been a favourite, and I\n    forgot not--how was it possible I could forget--those ominous\n    expressions, which intimated a possibility of the hereditary estate\n    and honours being transferred to the elder, instead of the younger\n    son. Now, it required no conjurer to foresee, that should Francis\n    commit this inexpiable crime of secretly allying himself with a\n    Scottish beauty, our sire would lose all wish to accomplish such a\n    transference in his favour; and while my brother's merits were\n    altogether obscured by such an unpardonable act of disobedience, my\n    own, no longer overshadowed by prejudice or partiality, would shine\n    forth in all their natural brilliancy. These considerations, which\n    flashed on me with the rapidity of lightning, induced me to consent\n    to hold Frank's back-hand, during the perilous game he proposed to\n    play. I had only to take care that my own share in the matter should\n    not be so prominent as to attract my father's attention; and this I\n    was little afraid of, for his wrath was usually of that vehement and\n    forcible character, which, like lightning, is attracted to one\n    single point, there bursting with violence as undivided as it was\n    uncontrollable.\n\n    \"I soon found the lovers needed my assistance more than I could have\n    supposed; for they were absolute novices in any sort of intrigue,\n    which to me seemed as easy and natural as lying. Francis had been\n    detected by some tattling spy in his walks with Clara, and the news\n    had been carried to old Mowbray, who was greatly incensed at his\n    daughter, though little knowing that her crime was greater than\n    admitting an unknown English student to form a personal acquaintance\n    with her. He prohibited farther intercourse--resolved, in\n    justice-of-peace phrase, to rid the country of us; and, prudently\n    sinking all mention of his daughter's delinquency, commenced an\n    action against Francis, under pretext of punishing him as an\n    encroacher upon his game, but in reality to scare him from the\n    neighbourhood. His person was particularly described to all the\n    keepers and satellites about Shaws-Castle, and any personal\n    intercourse betwixt him and Clara became impossible, except under\n    the most desperate risks. Nay, such was their alarm, that Master\n    Francis thought it prudent, for Miss Mowbray's sake, to withdraw as\n    far as a town called Marchthorn, and there to conceal himself,\n    maintaining his intercourse with Clara only by letter.\n\n    \"It was then I became the sheet-anchor of the hope of the lovers; it\n    was then my early dexterity and powers of contrivance were first put\n    to the test; and it would be too long to tell you in how many\n    shapes, and by how many contrivances, I acted as agent,\n    letter-carrier, and go-between, to maintain the intercourse of these\n    separated turtles. I have had a good deal of trouble in that way on\n    my own account, but never half so much as I took on account of this\n    brace of lovers. I scaled walls and swam rivers, set bloodhounds,\n    quarterstaves, and blunderbusses at defiance; and, excepting the\n    distant prospect of self-interest which I have hinted at, I was\n    neither to have honour nor reward for my pains. I will own to you,\n    that Clara Mowbray was so very beautiful--so absolutely confiding in\n    her lover's friend--and thrown into such close intercourse with me,\n    that there were times when I thought that, in conscience, she ought\n    not to have scrupled to have contributed a mite to reward the\n    faithful labourer. But then, she looked like purity itself; and I\n    was such a novice at that time of day, that I did not know how it\n    might have been possible for me to retreat, if I had made too bold\n    an advance--and, in short, I thought it best to content myself with\n    assisting true love to run smooth, in the hope that its course\n    would assure me, in the long-run, an Earl's title, and an Earl's\n    fortune.\n\n    \"Nothing was, therefore, ventured on my part which could raise\n    suspicion, and, as the confidential friend of the lovers, I prepared\n    every thing for their secret marriage. The pastor of the parish\n    agreed to perform the ceremony, prevailed upon by an argument which\n    I used to him, and which Clara, had she guessed it, would have\n    little thanked me for. I led the honest man to believe, that, in\n    declining to do his office, he might prevent a too successful lover\n    from doing justice to a betrayed maiden; and the parson, who, I\n    found, had a spice of romance in his disposition, resolved, under\n    such pressing circumstances, to do them the kind office of binding\n    them together, although the consequence might be a charge of\n    irregularity against himself. Old Mowbray was much confined to his\n    room, his daughter less watched since Frank had removed from the\n    neighbourhood--the brother (which, by the by, I should have said\n    before) not then in the country--and it was settled that the lovers\n    should meet at the Old Kirk of Saint Ronan's when the twilight\n    became deep, and go off in a chaise for England so soon as the\n    ceremony was performed.\n\n    \"When all this was arranged save the actual appointment of the day,\n    you cannot conceive the happiness and the gratitude of my sage\n    brother. He looked upon himself as approaching to the seventh\n    heaven, instead of losing his chance of a good fortune, and\n    encumbering himself at nineteen with a wife, and all the\n    probabilities of narrow circumstances, and an increasing family.\n    Though so much younger myself, I could not help wondering at his\n    extreme want of knowledge of the world, and feeling ashamed that I\n    had ever allowed him to take the airs of a tutor with me; and this\n    conscious superiority supported me against the thrill of jealousy\n    which always seized me when I thought of his carrying off the\n    beautiful prize, which, without my address, he could never have\n    made his own.--But at this important crisis, I had a letter from my\n    father, which, by some accident, had long lain at our lodgings in\n    Edinburgh; and then visited our former quarters in the Highlands;\n    again returned to Edinburgh, and at length reached me at Marchthorn\n    in a most critical time.\n\n    \"It was in reply to a letter of mine, in which, among other matters,\n    such as good boys send to their papas, descriptions of the country,\n    accounts of studies, exercises, and so forth, I had, to fill up the\n    sheet to a dutiful length, thrown in something about the family of\n    St. Ronan's, in the neighbourhood of which I was writing. I had no\n    idea what an effect the name would produce on the mind of my right\n    honourable father, but his letter sufficiently expressed it. He\n    charged me to cultivate the acquaintance of Mr. Mowbray as fast and\n    as intimately as possible; and, if need were, to inform him candidly\n    of our real character and situation in life. Wisely considering, at\n    the same time, that his filial admonition might be neglected if not\n    backed by some sufficient motive, his lordship frankly let me into\n    the secret of my granduncle by the mother's side, Mr. S. Mowbray of\n    Nettlewood's last will and testament, by which I saw, to my\n    astonishment and alarm, that a large and fair estate was bequeathed\n    to the eldest son and heir of the Earl of Etherington, on condition\n    of his forming a matrimonial alliance with a lady of the house of\n    Mowbray, of St. Ronan's.--Mercy of Heaven! how I stared! Here had I\n    been making every preparation for wedding Francis to the very girl,\n    whose hand would insure to myself wealth and independence!--And even\n    the first loss, though great, was not likely to be the last. My\n    father spoke of the marriage like a land-surveyor, but of the estate\n    of Nettlewood like an impassioned lover. He seemed to dote on every\n    acre of it, and dwelt on its contiguity to his own domains as a\n    circumstance which rendered the union of the estates not desirable\n    merely, but constituted an arrangement, pointed out by the hand of\n    nature. And although he observed, that, on account of the youth of\n    the parties, treaty of marriage could not be immediately undertaken,\n    it was yet clear he would approve at heart of any bold stroke which\n    would abolish the interval of time that might otherwise intervene,\n    ere Oakendale and Nettlewood became one property.\n\n    \"Here, then, were shipwrecked my fair hopes. It was clear as\n    sunshine, that a private marriage, unpardonable in the abstract,\n    would become venial, nay, highly laudable, in my father's eyes, if\n    it united his heir with Clara Mowbray; and if he really had, as my\n    fears suggested, the means of establishing legitimacy on my\n    brother's part, nothing was so likely to tempt him to use them, as\n    the certainty that, by his doing so, Nettlewood and Oakendale would\n    be united into one. The very catastrophe which I had prepared, as\n    sure to exclude my rival from his father's favour, was thus likely,\n    unless it could be prevented, to become a strong motive and argument\n    for the Earl placing his rights above mine.\n\n    \"I shut myself up in my bedroom; locked the door; read, and again\n    read my father's letter; and, instead of giving way to idle passion,\n    (beware of that, Harry, even in the most desperate circumstances,) I\n    considered, with keen investigation, whether some remedy could not\n    yet be found.--To break off the match for the time, would have been\n    easy--a little private information to Mr. Mowbray would have done\n    that with a vengeance--But then the treaty might be renewed under my\n    father's auspices;--at all events, the share which I had taken in\n    the intrigue between Clara and my brother, rendered it almost\n    impossible for me to become a suitor in my own person.--Amid these\n    perplexities, it suddenly occurred to my adventurous heart and\n    contriving brain--what if I should personate the bridegroom?--This\n    strange thought, you will recollect, occurred to a very youthful\n    brain--it was banished--it returned--returned again and again--was\n    viewed under every different shape--became familiar--was\n    adopted.--It was easy to fix the appointment with Clara and the\n    clergyman for I managed the whole correspondence--the resemblance\n    between Francis and me in stature and in proportion--the disguise\n    which we were to assume--the darkness of the church--the hurry of\n    the moment--might, I trusted, prevent Clara from recognising me. To\n    the minister I had only to say, that though I had hitherto talked of\n    a friend, I myself was the happy man. My first name was Francis as\n    well as his; and I had found Clara so gentle, so confiding, so\n    flatteringly cordial in her intercourse with me, that, once within\n    my power, and prevented from receding by shame, and a thousand\n    contradictory feelings, I had, with the vanity of an _amoureux de\n    seize ans_, the confidence to believe I could reconcile the fair\n    lady to the exchange.\n\n    \"There certainly never came such a thought into a madcap's brain;\n    and, what is more extraordinary--but that you already know--it was\n    so far successful, that the marriage ceremony was performed between\n    us in the presence of a servant of mine, Clara's accommodating\n    companion, and the priest.--We got into the carriage, and were a\n    mile from the church, when my unlucky or lucky brother stopped the\n    chaise by force--through what means he had obtained knowledge of my\n    little trick, I never have been able to learn. Solmes has been\n    faithful to me in too many instances, that I should suspect him in\n    this important crisis. I jumped out of the carriage, pitched\n    fraternity to the devil, and, betwixt desperation and something very\n    like shame, began to cut away with a couteau de chasse, which I had\n    provided in case of necessity.--All was in vain--I was hustled down\n    under the wheel of the carriage, and, the horses taking fright, it\n    went over my body.\n\n    \"Here ends my narrative; for I neither heard not saw more until I\n    found myself stretched on a sick-bed many miles from the scene of\n    action, and Solmes engaged in attending on me. In answer to my\n    passionate enquiries, he briefly informed me, that Master Francis\n    had sent back the young lady to her own dwelling, and that she\n    appeared to be extremely ill in consequence of the alarm she had\n    sustained. My own health, he assured me, was considered as very\n    precarious, and added, that Tyrrel, who was in the same house, was\n    in the utmost perturbation on my account. The very mention of his\n    name brought on a crisis in which I brought up much blood; and it is\n    singular that the physician who attended me--a grave gentleman, with\n    a wig--considered that this was of service to me. I know it\n    frightened me heartily, and prepared me for a visit from Master\n    Frank, which I endured with a tameness he would not have\n    experienced, had the usual current of blood flowed in my veins. But\n    sickness and the lancet make one very tolerant of sermonizing.--At\n    last, in consideration of being relieved from his accursed presence,\n    and the sound of his infernally calm voice, I slowly and reluctantly\n    acquiesced in an arrangement, by which he proposed that we should\n    for ever bid adieu to each other, and to Clara Mowbray. I would have\n    hesitated at this last stipulation. 'She was,' I said, 'my wife, and\n    I was entitled to claim her as such.'\n\n    \"This drew down a shower of most moral reproaches, and an assurance\n    that Clara disowned and detested my alliance; and that where there\n    had been an essential error in the person, the mere ceremony could\n    never be accounted binding by the law of any Christian country. I\n    wonder this had not occurred to me; but my ideas of marriage were\n    much founded on plays and novels, where such devices as I had\n    practised are often resorted to for winding up the plot, without any\n    hint of their illegality; besides, I had confided, as I mentioned\n    before, a little too rashly perhaps, in my own powers of persuading\n    so young a bride as Clara to be contented with one handsome fellow\n    instead of another.\n\n    \"Solmes took up the argument, when Francis released me by leaving\n    the room. He spoke of my father's resentment, should this enterprise\n    reach his ears--of the revenge of Mowbray of St. Ronan's, whose\n    nature was both haughty and rugged--of risk from the laws of the\n    country, and God knows what bugbears besides, which, at a more\n    advanced age, I would have laughed at. In a word, I sealed the\n    capitulation, vowed perpetual absence, and banished myself, as they\n    say in this country, forth of Scotland.\n\n    \"And here, Harry, observe and respect my genius. Every circumstance\n    was against me in this negotiation. I had been the aggressor in the\n    war; I was wounded, and, it might be said, a prisoner in my\n    antagonist's hands; yet I could so far avail myself of Monsieur\n    Martigny's greater eagerness for peace, that I clogged the treaty\n    with a condition highly advantageous to myself, and equally\n    unfavourable to him.--Said Mr. Francis Martigny was to take upon\n    himself the burden of my right honourable father's displeasure; and\n    our separation, which was certain to give immense offence, was to be\n    represented as his work, not as mine. I insisted, tender-hearted,\n    dutiful soul, as I was, that I would consent to no measure which was\n    to bring down papa's displeasure. This was a _sine qua non_ in our\n    negotiation.\n\n        'Voila ce que c'est d'avoir des talens!'\n\n    \"Monsieur Francis would, I suppose, have taken the world on his\n    shoulders, to have placed an eternal separation betwixt his\n    turtledove and the falcon who had made so bold a pounce at\n    her.--What he wrote to my father, I know not; as for myself, in all\n    duty, I represented the bad state of my health from an accident, and\n    that my brother and companion having been suddenly called from me\n    by some cause which he had not explained, I had thought it necessary\n    to get to London for the best advice, and only waited his lordship's\n    permission to return to the paternal mansion. This I soon received,\n    and found, as I expected, that he was in towering wrath against my\n    brother for his disobedience; and, after some time, I even had\n    reason to think, (as how could it be otherwise, Harry?) that, on\n    becoming better acquainted with the merits and amiable manners of\n    his apparent heir, he lost any desire which he might formerly have\n    entertained, of accomplishing any change in my circumstances in\n    relation to the world. Perhaps the old peer turned a little ashamed\n    of his own conduct, and dared not aver to the congregation of the\n    righteous, (for he became saintly in his latter days,) the very\n    pretty frolics which he seems to have been guilty of in his youth.\n    Perhaps, also, the death of my right honourable mother operated in\n    my favour, since, while she lived, my chance was the worse--there is\n    no saying what a man will do to spite his wife.--Enough, he\n    died--slept with his right honourable fathers, and I became, without\n    opposition, Right Honourable in his stead.\n\n    \"How I have borne my new honours, thou, Harry, and our merry set,\n    know full well. Newmarket and Tattersal's may tell the rest. I think\n    I have been as lucky as most men where luck is most prized, and so I\n    shall say no more on that subject.\n\n    \"And now, Harry, I will suppose thee in a moralizing mood; that is,\n    I will fancy the dice have run wrong--or your double-barrel has hung\n    fire--or a certain lady has looked cross--or any such weighty cause\n    of gravity has occurred, and you give me the benefit of your\n    seriousness.--'My dear Etherington,' say you pithily, 'you are a\n    precious fool!--Here you are, stirring up a business rather\n    scandalous in itself, and fraught with mischief to all concerned--a\n    business which might sleep for ever, if you let it alone, but which\n    is sure, like a sea-coal fire, to burst into a flame if you go on\n    poking it. I would like to ask your lordship only two\n    questions,'--say you, with your usual graceful attitude of adjusting\n    your perpendicular shirt-collar, and passing your hand over the knot\n    of your cravat, which deserves a peculiar place in the\n    _Tietania_[II-A][II-5]--'only two questions--that is, Whether you do\n    not repent the past, and whether you do not fear the future?' Very\n    comprehensive queries, these of yours, Harry; for they respect both\n    the time past and the time to come--one's whole life, in short.\n    However, I shall endeavour to answer them as well as I may.\n\n    \"Repent the past, said you?--Yes, Harry, I think I do repent the\n    past--that is, not quite in the parson's style of repentance, which\n    resembles yours when you have a headache, but as I would repent a\n    hand at cards which I had played on false principles. I should have\n    begun with the young lady--availed myself in a very different manner\n    of Monsieur Martigny's absence, and my own intimacy with her, and\n    thus superseded him, if possible, in the damsel's affections. The\n    scheme I adopted, though there was, I think, both boldness and\n    dexterity in it, was that of a novice of premature genius, who could\n    not calculate chances. So much for repentance.--Do I not fear the\n    future?--Harry, I will not cut your throat for supposing you to have\n    put the question, but calmly assure you, that I never feared any\n    thing in my life. I was born without the sensation, I believe; at\n    least, it is perfectly unknown to me. When I felt that cursed wheel\n    pass across my breast, when I felt the pistol-ball benumb my arm, I\n    felt no more agitation than at the bounce of a champagne-cork. But I\n    would not have you think that I am fool enough to risk plague,\n    trouble, and danger, all of which, besides considerable expense, I\n    am now prepared to encounter, without some adequate motive,--and\n    here it is.\n\n    \"From various quarters, hints, rumours, and surmises have reached\n    me, that an attack will be made on my rank and status in society,\n    which can only be in behalf of this fellow Martigny, (for I will not\n    call him by his stolen name of Tyrrel.) Now, this I hold to be a\n    breach of the paction betwixt us, by which--that is, by that which I\n    am determined to esteem its true meaning and purport--he was to\n    leave my right honourable father and me to settle our own matters\n    without his interference, which amounted to a virtual resignation of\n    his rights, if the scoundrel ever had any. Can he expect I am to\n    resign my wife, and what is a better thing, old Scrogie Mowbray's\n    estate of Nettlewood, to gratify the humour of a fellow who sets up\n    claims to my title and whole property? No, by ----! If he assails me\n    in a point so important, I will retaliate upon him in one where he\n    will feel as keenly; and that he may depend upon.--And now,\n    methinks, you come upon me with a second edition of your grave\n    remonstrances, about family feuds, unnatural rencontres, offence to\n    all the feelings of all the world, et cetera, et cetera, which you\n    might usher in most delectably with the old stave about brethren\n    dwelling together in unity. I will not stop to enquire, whether all\n    these delicate apprehensions are on account of the Earl of\n    Etherington, his safety, and his reputation; or whether my friend\n    Harry Jekyl be not considering how far his own interference with\n    such a naughty business will be well taken at Head-quarters; and so,\n    without pausing on that question, I shall barely and briefly say,\n    that you cannot be more sensible than I am of the madness of\n    bringing matters to such an extremity--I have no such intention, I\n    assure you, and it is with no such purpose that I invite you\n    here.--Were I to challenge Martigny, he would refuse me the\n    meeting; and all less ceremonious ways of arranging such an affair\n    are quite old-fashioned.\n\n    \"It is true, at our first meeting, I was betrayed into the scrape I\n    told you of--just as you may have shot (or shot _at_, for I think\n    you are no downright hitter) a hen-pheasant, when flushed within\n    distance, by a sort of instinctive movement, without reflecting on\n    the enormity you are about to commit. The truth is, there is an\n    ignis fatuus influence, which seems to govern our house--it poured\n    its wildfire through my father's veins--it has descended to me in\n    full vigour, and every now and then its impulse is irresistible.\n    There was my enemy, and here were my pistols, was all I had time to\n    think about the matter. But I will be on my guard in future, the\n    more surety, as I cannot receive any provocation from him; on the\n    contrary, if I must confess the truth, though I was willing to gloss\n    it a little in my first account of the matter, (like the Gazette,\n    when recording a defeat,) I am certain he would never voluntarily\n    have fired at me, and that his pistol went off as he fell. You know\n    me well enough to be assured, that I will never be again in the\n    scrape of attacking an unresisting antagonist, were he ten times my\n    brother.\n\n    \"Then, as to this long tirade about hating my brother--Harry, I do\n    not hate him more than the first-born of Egypt are in general hated\n    by those whom they exclude from entailed estates, and so forth--not\n    one lauded man in twenty of us that is not hated by his younger\n    brothers, to the extent of wishing him quiet in his grave, as an\n    abominable stumbling-block in their path of life; and so far only do\n    I hate Monsieur Martigny. But for the rest, I rather like him as\n    otherwise; and would he but die, would give my frank consent to his\n    being canonized: and while he lives, I am not desirous that he\n    should be exposed to any temptation from rank and riches, those\n    main obstacles to the self-denying course of life, by which the\n    odour of sanctity is attained.\n\n    \"Here again you break in with your impertinent queries--If I have no\n    purpose of quarrelling personally with Martigny, why do I come into\n    collision with him at all?--why not abide by the treaty of\n    Marchthorn, and remain in England, without again approaching Saint\n    Ronan's, or claiming my maiden bride?\n\n    \"Have I not told you, I want him to cease all threatened attempts\n    upon my fortune and dignity? Have I not told you, that I want to\n    claim my wife, Clara Mowbray, and my estate of Nettlewood, fairly\n    won by marrying her?--And, to let you into the whole secret, though\n    Clara is a very pretty woman, yet she goes for so little in the\n    transaction with me, her animpassioned bridegroom, that I hope to\n    make some relaxation of my rights over her the means of obtaining\n    the concessions which I think most important.\n\n    \"I will not deny, that an aversion to awakening bustle, and\n    encountering reproach, has made me so slow in looking after my\n    interest, that the period will shortly expire, within which I ought,\n    by old Scrog Mowbray's will, to qualify myself for becoming his\n    heir, by being the accepted husband of Miss Mowbray of St. Ronan's.\n    Time was--time is--and, if I catch it not by the forelock as it\n    passes, time will be no more--Nettlewood will be forfeited--and if I\n    have in addition a lawsuit for my title, and for Oakendale, I run a\n    risk of being altogether capotted. I must, therefore, act at all\n    risks, and act with vigour--and this is the general plan of my\n    campaign, subject always to be altered according to circumstances. I\n    have obtained--I may say purchased--Mowbray's consent to address his\n    sister. I have this advantage, that if she agrees to take me, she\n    will for ever put a stop to all disagreeable reports and\n    recollections, founded on her former conduct. In that case I secure\n    the Nettlewood property, and am ready to wage war for my paternal\n    estate. Indeed, I firmly believe, that should this happy\n    consummation take place, Monsieur Martigny will be too much\n    heart-broken to make further fight, but will e'en throw helve after\n    hatchet, and run to hide himself, after the fashion of a true lover,\n    in some desert beyond seas.\n\n    \"But supposing the lady has the bad taste to be obstinate, and will\n    none of me, I still think that her happiness, or her peace of mind,\n    will be as dear to Martigny, as Gibraltar is to the Spaniards, and\n    that he will sacrifice a great deal to induce me to give up my\n    pretensions. Now, I shall want some one to act as my agent in\n    communicating with this fellow; for I will not deny that my old\n    appetite for cutting his throat may awaken suddenly, were I to hold\n    personal intercourse with him. Come thou, therefore, without delay,\n    and hold my back-hand--Come, for you know me, and that I never left\n    a kindness unrewarded. To be specific, you shall have means to pay\n    off a certain inconvenient mortgage, without troubling the tribe of\n    Issachar, if you will be but true to me in this matter--Come,\n    therefore, without further apologies or further delay. There shall,\n    I give you my word, neither be risk or offence in the part of the\n    drama which I intend to commit to your charge.\n\n    \"Talking of the drama, we had a miserable attempt at a sort of\n    bastard theatricals, at Mowbray's rat-gnawed mansion. There were two\n    things worth noticing--One, that I lost all the courage on which I\n    pique myself, and fairly fled from the pit, rather than present\n    myself before Miss Clara Mowbray, when it came to the push. And upon\n    this I pray you to remark, that I am a person of singular delicacy\n    and modesty, instead of being the Drawcansir and Daredevil that you\n    would make of me. The other memorabile is of a more delicate nature,\n    respecting the conduct of a certain fair lady, who seemed determined\n    to fling herself at my head. There is a wonderful degree of\n    freemasonry among us folk of spirit; and it is astonishing how soon\n    we can place ourselves on a footing with neglected wives and\n    discontented daughters. If you come not soon, one of the rewards\n    held out to you in my former letter, will certainly not be\n    forthcoming. No schoolboy keeps gingerbread, for his comrade,\n    without feeling a desire to nibble at it; so, if you appear not to\n    look after your own interest, say you had fair warning. For my own\n    part, I am rather embarrassed than gratified by the prospect of such\n    an affair, when I have on the tapis another of a different nature.\n    This enigma I will explain at meeting.\n\n    \"Thus finishes my long communication. If my motives of action do not\n    appear explicit, think in what a maze fortune has involved me, and\n    how much must necessarily depend on the chapter of accidents.\n\n    \"Yesterday I may be said to have opened my siege, for I presented\n    myself before Clara. I had no very flattering reception--that was of\n    little consequence, for I did not expect one. By alarming her fears,\n    I made an impression thus far, that she acquiesces in my appearing\n    before her as her brother's guest, and this is no small point\n    gained. She will become accustomed to look on me, and will remember\n    with less bitterness the trick which I played her formerly; while I,\n    on the other hand, by a similar force of habit, will get over\n    certain awkward feelings with which I have been compunctiously\n    visited whenever I look upon her.--Adieu! Health and brotherhood.\n\n    \"Thine,\n        \"ETHERINGTON.\"\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[II-5] See Editor's Notes at the end of the Volume.

The Ignis Fatuus which, you\n    say, governed your father, seems to have ruled the fortunes of your\n    whole house, there is so much eccentricity in all that you have told\n    me. But _n'importe_, Etherington, you were my friend--you held me up\n    when I was completely broken down; and, whatever you may think, my\n    services are at your command much more from reflections on the past,\n    than hopes for the future. I am no speechmaker, but this you may\n    rely on while I continue to be Harry Jekyl. You have deserved some\n    love at my hands, Etherington, and you have it.\n\n    \"Perhaps I love you the better since your perplexities have become\n    known to me; for, my dear Etherington, you were before too much an\n    object of envy to be entirely an object of affection. What a happy\n    fellow! was the song of all who named you. Bank, and a fortune to\n    maintain it--luck sufficient to repair all the waste that you could\n    make in your income, and skill to back that luck, or supply it\n    should it for a moment fail you.--The cards turning up as if to\n    your wish--the dice rolling, it almost seemed, at your wink--it was\n    rather your look than the touch of your cue that sent the ball into\n    the pocket. You seemed to have fortune in chains, and a man of less\n    honour would have been almost suspected of helping his luck by a\n    little art.--You won every bet; and the instant that you were\n    interested, one might have named the winning horse--it was always\n    that which you were to gain most by.--You never held out your piece\n    but the game went down--and then the women!--with face, manners,\n    person, and, above all, your tongue--what wild work have you made\n    among them!--Good heaven! and have you had the old sword hanging\n    over your head by a horsehair all this while?--Has your rank been\n    doubtful?--Your fortune unsettled?--And your luck, so constant in\n    every thing else, has that, as well as your predominant influence\n    with the women, failed you, when you wished to form a connexion for\n    life, and when the care of your fortune required you to do\n    so?--Etherington, I am astonished!--The Mowbray scrape I always\n    thought an inconvenient one, as well as the quarrel with this same\n    Tyrrel, or Martigny; but I was far from guessing the complicated\n    nature of your perplexities.\n\n    \"But I must not run on in a manner which, though it relieves my own\n    marvelling mind, cannot be very pleasant to you. Enough, I look on\n    my obligations to you as more light to be borne, now I have some\n    chance of repaying them to a certain extent; but, even were the full\n    debt paid, I would remain as much attached to you as ever. It is\n    your friend who speaks, Etherington; and, if he offers his advice in\n    somewhat plain language, do not, I entreat you, suppose that your\n    confidence has encouraged an offensive familiarity, but consider me\n    as one who, in a weighty matter, writes plainly, to avoid the least\n    chance of misconstruction.\n\n    \"Etherington, your conduct hitherto has resembled anything rather\n    than the coolness and judgment which are so peculiarly your own\n    when you choose to display them. I pass over the masquerade of your\n    marriage--it was a boy's trick, which could hardly have availed you\n    much, even if successful; for what sort of a wife would you have\n    acquired, had this same Clara Mowbray proved willing to have\n    accepted the change which you had put upon her, and transferred\n    herself, without repugnance, from one bridegroom to another?--Poor\n    as I am, I know that neither Nettlewood nor Oakendale should have\n    bribed me to marry such a ---- I cannot decorously fill up the\n    blank.\n\n    \"Neither, my dear Etherington, can I forgive you the trick you put\n    on the clergyman, in whose eyes you destroyed the poor girl's\n    character to induce him to consent to perform the ceremony, and have\n    thereby perhaps fixed an indelible stain on her for life--this was\n    not a fair _ruse de guerre_.--As it is, you have taken little by\n    your stratagem--unless, indeed, it should be difficult for the young\n    lady to prove the imposition put upon her--for that being admitted,\n    the marriage certainly goes for nothing. At least, the only use you\n    can make of it, would be to drive her into a more formal union, for\n    fear of having this whole unpleasant discussion brought into a court\n    of law; and in this, with all the advantages you possess, joined to\n    your own arts of persuasion, and her brother's influence, I should\n    think you very likely to succeed. All women are necessarily the\n    slaves of their reputation. I have known some who have given up\n    their virtue to preserve their character, which is, after all, only\n    the shadow of it. I therefore would not conceive it difficult for\n    Clara Mowbray to persuade herself to become a countess, rather than\n    be the topic of conversation for all Britain, while a lawsuit\n    betwixt you is in dependence; and that may be for the greater part\n    of both your lives.\n\n    \"But, in Miss Mowbray's state of mind, it may require time to bring\n    her to such a conclusion; and I fear you will be thwarted in your\n    operations by your rival--I will not offend you by calling him your\n    brother. Now, it is here that I think with pleasure I may be of some\n    use to you,--under this special condition, that there shall be no\n    thoughts of farther violence taking place between you. However you\n    may have smoothed over your rencontre to yourself, there is no doubt\n    that the public would have regarded any accident which might have\n    befallen on that occasion, as a crime of the deepest dye, and that\n    the law would have followed it with the most severe punishment. And\n    for all that I have said of my serviceable disposition, I would fain\n    stop short on this side of the gallows--my neck is too long already.\n    Without a jest, Etherington, you must be ruled by counsel in this\n    matter. I detect your hatred to this man in every line of your\n    letter, even when you write with the greatest coolness; even where\n    there is an affectation of gaiety, I read your sentiments on this\n    subject; and they are such as--I will not preach to you--I will not\n    say a good man--but such as every wise man--every man who wishes to\n    live on fair terms with the world, and to escape general\n    malediction, and perhaps a violent death, where all men will clap\n    their hands and rejoice at the punishment of the fratricide,--would,\n    with all possible speed, eradicate from his breast. My services\n    therefore, if they are worth your acceptance, are offered on the\n    condition that this unholy hatred be subdued with the utmost force\n    of your powerful mind, and that you avoid every thing which can\n    possibly lead to such a catastrophe as you have twice narrowly\n    escaped. I do not ask you to like this man, for I know well the deep\n    root which your prejudices hold in your mind; I merely ask you to\n    avoid him, and to think of him as one, who, if you do meet him, can\n    never be the object of personal resentment.\n\n    \"On these conditions, I will instantly join you at your Spa, and\n    wait but your answer to throw myself into the post-chaise. I will\n    seek out this Martigny for you, and I have the vanity to think I\n    shall be able to persuade him to take the course which his own true\n    interest, as well as yours, so plainly points out--and that is, to\n    depart and make us free of him. You must not grudge a round sum of\n    money, should that prove necessary--we must make wings for him to\n    fly with, and I must be empowered by you to that purpose. I cannot\n    think you have any thing serious to fear from a lawsuit. Your father\n    threw out this sinister hint at a moment when he was enraged at his\n    wife, and irritated by his son; and I have little doubt that his\n    expressions were merely flashes of anger at the moment, though I see\n    they have made a deep impression on you. At all events, he spoke of\n    a preference to his illegitimate son, as something which it was in\n    his own power to give or to withhold; and he has died without\n    bestowing it. The family seem addicted to irregular matrimony, and\n    some left-handed marriage there may have been used to propitiate the\n    modesty, and save the conscience, of the French lady; but, that any\n    thing of the nature of a serious and legal ceremony took place,\n    nothing but the strongest proof can make me believe.\n\n    \"I repeat, then, that I have little doubt that the claims of\n    Martigny, whatever they are, may be easily compounded, and England\n    made clear of him. This will be more easily done, if he really\n    entertains such a romantic passion, as you describe, for Miss Clara\n    Mowbray. It would be easy to show him, that whether she is disposed\n    to accept your lordship's hand or not, her quiet and peace of mind\n    must depend on his leaving the country. Rely on it, I shall find out\n    the way to smooth him down, and whether distance or the grave divide\n    Martigny and you, is very little to the purpose; unless in so far as\n    the one point can be attained with honour and safety, and the other,\n    if attempted, would only make all concerned the subject of general\n    execration and deserved punishment.--Speak the word, and I attend\n    you, as your truly grateful and devoted\n\n    \"HENRY JEKYL.\"\n\nTo this admonitory epistle, the writer received, in the course of post,\nthe following answer:--\n\n    \"My truly grateful and devoted Henry Jekyl has adopted a tone, which\n    seems to be exalted without any occasion. Why, thou suspicious\n    monitor, have I not repeated a hundred times that I repent sincerely\n    of the foolish rencontre, and am determined to curb my temper, and\n    be on my guard in future--And what need you come upon me, with your\n    long lesson about execration, and punishment, and fratricide, and so\n    forth?--You deal with an argument as a boy does with the first hare\n    he shoots, which he never thinks dead till he has fired the second\n    barrel into her. What a fellow you would have been for a lawyer! how\n    long you would have held forth upon the plainest cause, until the\n    poor bothered judge was almost willing to decide against justice,\n    that he might be revenged on you. If I must repeat what I have said\n    twenty times, I tell you I have no thoughts of proceeding with this\n    fellow as I would with another. If my father's blood be in his\n    veins, it shall save the skin his mother gave him. And so come,\n    without more parade, either of stipulation or argument. Thou art,\n    indeed, a curious animal! One would think, to read your\n    communication, that you had yourself discovered the propriety of\n    acting as a negotiator, and the reasons which might, in the course\n    of such a treaty, be urged with advantage to induce this fellow to\n    leave the country--Why, this is the very course chalked out in my\n    last letter! You are bolder than the boldest gipsy, for you not only\n    steal my ideas, and disfigure them that they may pass for yours, but\n    you have the assurance to come a-begging with them to the door of\n    the original parent! No man like you for stealing other men's\n    inventions, and cooking them up in your own way. However, Harry,\n    bating a little self-conceit and assumption, thou art as honest a\n    fellow as ever man put faith in--clever, too, in your own style,\n    though not quite the genius you would fain pass for.--Come on thine\n    own terms, and come as speedily as thou canst. I do not reckon the\n    promise I made the less binding, that you very generously make no\n    allusion to it.\n\n    \"Thine,\n        \"ETHERINGTON.\n\n    \"P.S. One single caution I must add--do not mention my name to any\n    one at Harrowgate, or your prospect of meeting me, or the route\n    which you are about to take. On the purpose of your journey, it is\n    unnecessary to recommend silence. I know not whether such doubts are\n    natural to all who have secret measures to pursue, or whether nature\n    has given me an unusual share of anxious suspicion; but I cannot\n    divest myself of the idea, that I am closely watched by some one\n    whom I cannot discover. Although I concealed my purpose of coming\n    hither from all mankind but you, whom I do not for an instant\n    suspect of blabbing, yet it was known to this Martigny, and he is\n    down here before me. Again, I said not a word--gave not a hint to\n    any one of my views towards Clara, yet the tattling people here had\n    spread a report of a marriage depending between us, even before I\n    could make the motion to her brother. To be sure, in such society\n    there is nothing talked of but marrying and giving in marriage; and\n    this, which alarms me, as connected with my own private purposes,\n    may be a bare rumour, arising out of the gossip of the place--Yet I\n    feel like the poor woman in the old story, who felt herself watched\n    by an eye that glared upon her from behind the tapestry.\n\n    \"I should have told you in my last, that I had been recognised at a\n    public entertainment by the old clergyman, who pronounced the\n    matrimonial blessing on Clara and me, nearly eight years ago. He\n    insisted upon addressing me by the name of Valentine Bulmer, under\n    which I was then best known. It did not suit me at present to put\n    him into my confidence, so I cut him, Harry, as I would an old\n    pencil. The task was the less difficult, that I had to do with one\n    of the most absent men that ever dreamed with his eyes open. I\n    verily believe he might be persuaded that the whole transaction was\n    a vision, and that he had never in reality seen me before. Your\n    pious rebuke, therefore, about what I told him formerly concerning\n    the lovers, is quite thrown away. After all, if what I said was not\n    accurately true, as I certainly believe it was an exaggeration, it\n    was all Saint Francis of Martigny's fault, I suppose. I am sure he\n    had love and opportunity on his side.\n\n    \"Here you have a postscript, Harry, longer than the letter, but it\n    must conclude with the same burden--Come, and come quickly.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX.\n\nTHE FRIGHT.\n\n    As shakes the bough of trembling leaf,\n      When sudden whirlwinds rise;\n    As stands aghast the warrior chief,\n      When his base army flies.\n     . . . . . .\n\n\nIt had been settled by all who took the matter into consideration, that\nthe fidgety, fiery, old Nabob would soon quarrel with his landlady, Mrs.\nDods, and become impatient of his residence at St. Ronan's. A man so\nkind to himself, and so inquisitive about the affairs of others, could\nhave, it was supposed, a limited sphere for gratification either of his\ntastes or of his curiosity, in the Aultoun of St. Ronan's: and many a\ntime the precise day and hour of his departure were fixed by the idlers\nat the Spa. But still old Touchwood appeared amongst them when the\nweather permitted, with his nut-brown visage, his throat carefully\nwrapped up in an immense Indian kerchief, and his gold-headed cane,\nwhich he never failed to carry over his shoulder; his short, but stout\nlimbs, and his active step, showing plainly that he bore it rather as a\nbadge of dignity than a means of support. There he stood, answering\nshortly and gruffly to all questions proposed to him, and making his\nremarks aloud upon the company, with great indifference as to the\noffence which plight be taken; and as soon as the ancient priestess had\nhanded him his glass of the salutiferous water, turned on his heel with\na brief good-morning, and either marched back to hide himself in the\nManse, with his crony Mr. Cargill, or to engage in some hobby-horsical\npursuit connected with his neighbours in the Aultoun.\n\nThe truth was, that the honest gentleman having, so far as Mrs. Dods\nwould permit, put matters to rights within her residence, wisely\nabstained from pushing his innovations any farther, aware that it is not\nevery stone which is capable of receiving the last degree of polish. He\nnext set himself about putting Mr. Cargill's house into order; and\nwithout leave asked or given by that reverend gentleman, he actually\naccomplished as wonderful a reformation in the Manse, as could have been\neffected by a benevolent Brownie. The floors were sometimes swept--the\ncarpets were sometimes shaken--the plates and dishes were cleaner--there\nwas tea and sugar in the tea-chest, and a joint of meat at proper times\nwas to be found in the larder. The elder maid-servant wore a good stuff\ngown--the younger snooded up her hair, and now went about the house a\ndamsel so trig and neat, that some said she was too handsome for the\nservice of a bachelor divine; and others, that they saw no business so\nold a fool as the Nabob had to be meddling with a lassie's busking. But\nfor such evil bruits Mr. Touchwood cared not, even if he happened to\nhear of them, which was very doubtful. Add to all these changes, that\nthe garden was weeded, and the glebe was regularly laboured.\n\nThe talisman by which all this desirable alteration was wrought,\nconsisted partly in small presents, partly in constant attention. The\nliberality of the singular old gentleman gave him a perfect right to\nscold when he saw things wrong; the domestics, who had fallen into total\nsloth and indifference, began to exert themselves under Mr. Touchwood's\nnew system of rewards and surveillance; and the minister, half\nunconscious of the cause, reaped the advantage of the exertions of his\nbusy friend. Sometimes he lifted his head, when he heard workmen\nthumping and bouncing in the neighbourhood of his study, and demanded\nthe meaning of the clatter which annoyed him; but on receiving for\nanswer that it was by order of Mr. Touchwood, he resumed his labours,\nunder the persuasion that all was well.\n\nBut even the Augean task of putting the Manse in order, did not satisfy\nthe gigantic activity of Mr. Touchwood. He aspired to universal dominion\nin the Aultoun of St. Ronan's; and, like most men of an ardent temper,\nhe contrived, in a great measure, to possess himself of the authority\nwhich he longed after. Then was there war waged by him with all the\npetty, but perpetual nuisances, which infest a Scottish town of the old\nstamp--then was the hereditary dunghill, which had reeked before the\nwindow of the cottage for fourscore years, transported behind the\nhouse--then was the broken wheelbarrow, or unserviceable cart, removed\nout of the footpath--the old hat, or blue petticoat, taken from the\nwindow into which it had been stuffed, to \"expel the winter's flaw,\" was\nconsigned to the gutter, and its place supplied by good perspicuous\nglass. The means by which such reformation was effected, were the same\nas resorted to in the Manse--money and admonition. The latter given\nalone would have met little attention--perhaps would have provoked\nopposition--but, softened and sweetened by a little present to assist\nthe reform recommended, it sunk into the hearts of the hearers, and in\ngeneral overcame their objections. Besides, an opinion of the Nabob's\nwealth was high among the villagers; and an idea prevailed amongst them,\nthat, notwithstanding his keeping no servants or equipage, he was able\nto purchase, if he pleased, half the land in the country. It was not\ngrand carriages and fine liveries that made heavy purses, they rather\nhelped to lighten them; and they said, who pretended to know what they\nwere talking about, that old Turnpenny, and Mr. Bindloose to boot, would\ntell down more money on Mr. Touchwood's mere word, than upon the joint\nbond of half the fine folk at the Well. Such an opinion smoothed every\nthing before the path of one, who showed himself neither averse to give\nnor to lend; and it by no means diminished the reputation of his wealth,\nthat in transactions of business he was not carelessly negligent of his\ninterest, but plainly showed he understood the value of what he was\nparting with. Few, therefore, cared to withstand the humours of a\nwhimsical old gentleman, who had both the will and the means of obliging\nthose disposed to comply with his fancies; and thus the singular\nstranger contrived, in the course of a brief space of days or weeks, to\nplace the villagers more absolutely at his devotion, than they had been\nto the pleasure of any individual since their ancient lords had left the\nAultoun. The power of the baron-bailie himself, though the office was\nvested in the person of old Meiklewham, was a subordinate jurisdiction,\ncompared to the voluntary allegiance which the inhabitants paid to Mr.\nTouchwood.\n\nThere were, however, recusants, who declined the authority thus set up\namongst them, and, with the characteristic obstinacy of their\ncountrymen, refused to hearken to the words of the stranger, whether\nthey were for good or for evil. These men's dunghills were not removed,\nnor the stumbling-blocks taken from the footpath, where it passed the\nfront of their houses. And it befell, that while Mr. Touchwood was most\neager in abating the nuisances of the village, he had very nearly\nexperienced a frequent fate of great reformers--that of losing his life\nby means of one of those enormities which as yet had subsisted in spite\nof all his efforts.\n\nThe Nabob finding his time after dinner hang somewhat heavy on his hand,\nand the moon being tolerably bright, had, one harvest evening, sought\nhis usual remedy for dispelling ennui by a walk to the Manse, where he\nwas sure, that, if he could not succeed in engaging the minister himself\nin some disputation, he would at least find something in the\nestablishment to animadvert upon and to restore to order.\n\nAccordingly, he had taken the opportunity to lecture the younger of the\nminister's lasses upon the duty of wearing shoes and stockings; and, as\nhis advice came fortified by a present of six pair of white cotton hose,\nand two pair of stout leathern shoes, it was received, not with respect\nonly, but with gratitude, and the chuck under the chin that rounded up\nthe oration, while she opened the outer door for his honour, was\nacknowledged with a blush and a giggle. Nay, so far did Grizzy carry her\nsense of Mr. Touchwood's kindness, that, observing the moon was behind a\ncloud, she very carefully offered to escort him to the Cleikum Inn with\na lantern, in case he should come to some harm by the gate. This the\ntraveller's independent spirit scorned to listen to; and, having briefly\nassured her that he had walked the streets of Paris and of Madrid whole\nnights without such an accommodation, he stoutly strode off on his\nreturn to his lodgings.\n\nAn accident, however, befell him, which, unless the police of Madrid and\nParis be belied, might have happened in either of those two splendid\ncapitals, as well as in the miserable Aultoun of St. Ronan's. Before the\ndoor of Saunders Jaup, a feuar of some importance, \"who held his land\nfree, and caredna a bodle for any one,\" yawned that odoriferous gulf,\nycleped, in Scottish phrase, the jawhole; in other words, an uncovered\ncommon sewer. The local situation of this receptacle of filth was well\nknown to Mr. Touchwood; for Saunders Jaup was at the very head of those\nwho held out for the practices of their fathers, and still maintained\nthose ancient and unsavoury customs which our traveller had in so many\ninstances succeeded in abating. Guided, therefore, by his nose, the\nNabob made a considerable circuit to avoid the displeasure and danger of\npassing this filthy puddle at the nearest, and by that means fell upon\nScylla as he sought to avoid Charybdis. In plain language, he approached\nso near the bank of a little rivulet, which in that place passed betwixt\nthe footpath and the horse-road, that he lost his footing, and fell into\nthe channel of the streamlet from a height of three or four feet. It was\nthought that the noise of his fall, or at least his call for assistance,\nmust have been heard in the house of Saunders Jaup; but that honest\nperson was, according to his own account, at that time engaged in the\nexercise of the evening; an excuse which passed current, although\nSaunders was privately heard to allege, that the town would have been\nthe quieter, \"if the auld, meddling busybody had bidden still in the\nburn for gude and a'.\"\n\nBut Fortune had provided better for poor Touchwood, whose foibles, as\nthey arose out of the most excellent motives, would have ill deserved so\nsevere a fate. A passenger, who heard him shout for help, ventured\ncautiously to the side of the bank, down which he had fallen; and, after\nascertaining the nature of the ground as carefully as the darkness\npermitted, was at length, and not without some effort, enabled to assist\nhim out of the channel of the rivulet.\n\n\"Are you hurt materially?\" said this good Samaritan to the object of his\ncare.\n\n\"No--no--d--n it--no,\" said Touchwood, extremely angry at his disaster,\nand the cause of it. \"Do you think I, who have been at the summit of\nMount Athos, where the precipice sinks a thousand feet on the sea, care\na farthing about such a fall as this is?\"\n\nBut, as he spoke, he reeled, and his kind assistant caught him by the\narm to prevent his falling.\n\n\"I fear you are more hurt than you suppose, sir,\" said the stranger:\n\"permit me to go home along with you.\"\n\n\"With all my heart,\" said Touchwood; \"for though it is impossible I can\nneed help in such a foolish matter, yet I am equally obliged to you,\nfriend; and if the Cleikum Inn be not out of your road, I will take your\narm so far, and thank you to the boot.\"\n\n\"It is much at your service, sir,\" said the stranger; \"indeed, I was\nthinking to lodge there for the night.\"\n\n\"I am glad to hear it,\" resumed Touchwood; \"you shall be my guest, and I\nwill make them look after you in proper fashion--You seem to be a very\ncivil sort of fellow, and I do not find your arm inconvenient--it is the\nrheumatism makes me walk so ill--the pest of all that have been in hot\nclimates when they settle among these d--d fogs.\"\n\n\"Lean as hard and walk as slow as you will, sir,\" said the benevolent\nassistant--\"this is a rough street.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir--and why is it rough?\" answered Touchwood. \"Why, because the\nold pig-headed fool, Saunders Jaup, will not allow it to be made smooth.\nThere he sits, sir, and obstructs all rational improvement; and, if a\nman would not fall into his infernal putrid gutter, and so become an\nabomination to himself and odious to others, for his whole life to come,\nhe runs the risk of breaking his neck, as I have done to-night.\"\n\n\"I am afraid, sir,\" said his companion, \"you have fallen on the most\ndangerous side.--You remember Swift's proverb, 'The more dirt, the less\nhurt.'\"\n\n\"But why should there be either dirt or hurt in a well-regulated place?\"\nanswered Touchwood--\"Why should not men be able to go about their\naffairs at night, in such a hamlet as this, without either endangering\nnecks or noses?--Our Scottish magistrates are worth nothing, sir--nothing\nat all. Oh for a Turkish Cadi, now, to trounce the scoundrel--or the\nMayor of Calcutta to bring him into his court--or were it but an English\nJustice of the Peace that is newly included in the commission, they\nwould abate the villain's nuisance with a vengeance on him!--But here we\nare--this is the Cleikum Inn.--Hallo--hilloa--house!--Eppie\nAnderson!--Beenie Chambermaid!--boy Boots!--Mrs. Dods!--are you all of\nyou asleep and dead?--Here have I been half murdered, and you let me\nstand bawling at the door!\"\n\nEppie Anderson came with a light, and so did Beenie Chambermaid with\nanother; but no sooner did they look upon the pair who stood in the\nporch under the huge sign that swung to and fro with heavy creaking,\nthan Beenie screamed, flung away her candle, although a four in the\npound, and in a newly japanned candlestick, and fled one way, while\nEppie Anderson, echoing the yell, brandished her light round her head\nlike a Bacchante flourishing her torch, and ran off in another\ndirection.\n\n\"Ay--I must be a bloody spectacle,\" said Mr. Touchwood, letting himself\nfall heavily upon his assistant's shoulder, and wiping his face, which\ntrickled with wet--\"I did not think I had been so seriously hurt; but I\nfind my weakness now--I must have lost much blood.\"\n\n\"I hope you are still mistaken,\" said the stranger; \"but here lies the\nway to the kitchen--we shall find light there, since no one chooses to\nbring it to us.\"\n\n[Illustration]\n\nHe assisted the old gentleman into the kitchen, where a lamp, as well as\na bright fire, was burning, by the light of which he could easily\ndiscern that the supposed blood was only water of the rivulet, and,\nindeed, none of the cleanest, although much more so than the sufferer\nwould have found it a little lower, where the stream is joined by the\nsuperfluities of Saunders Jaup's palladium. Relieved by his new\nfriend's repeated assurances that such was the case, the Senior began to\nbustle up a little, and his companion, desirous to render him every\nassistance, went to the door of the kitchen to call for a basin and\nwater. Just as he was about to open the door, the voice of Mrs. Dods was\nheard as she descended the stairs, in a tone of indignation by no means\nunusual to her, yet mingled at the same time with a few notes that\nsounded like unto the quaverings of consternation.\n\n\"Idle limmers--silly sluts--I'll warrant nane o' ye will ever see ony\nthing waur than yoursell, ye silly tawpies--Ghaist, indeed!--I'll\nwarrant it's some idle dub-skelper frae the Waal, coming after some o'\nyoursells on nae honest errand--Ghaist, indeed!--Haud up the candle,\nJohn Ostler--I'se warrant it a twa-handed ghaist, and the door left on\nthe sneck. There's somebody in the kitchen--gang forward wi' the\nlantern, John Ostler.\"\n\nAt this critical moment the stranger opened the door of the kitchen, and\nbeheld the Dame advancing at the head of her household troops. The\nostler and humpbacked postilion, one bearing a stable-lantern and a\nhay-fork, the other a rushlight and a broom, constituted the advanced\nguard; Mrs. Dods herself formed the centre, talking loud and brandishing\na pair of tongs; while the two maids, like troops not to be much trusted\nafter their recent defeat, followed, cowering in the rear. But\nnotwithstanding this admirable disposition, no sooner had the stranger\nshown his face, and pronounced the words \"Mrs. Dods!\" than a panic\nseized the whole array. The advanced guard recoiled in consternation,\nthe ostler upsetting Mrs. Dods in the confusion of his retreat; while\nshe, grappling with him in her terror, secured him by the ears and\nhair, and they joined their cries together in hideous chorus. The two\nmaidens resumed their former flight, and took refuge in the darksome\nden, entitled their bedroom, while the humpbacked postilion fled like\nthe wind into the stable, and, with professional instinct, began, in the\nextremity of his terror, to saddle a horse.\n\nMeanwhile, the guest whose appearance had caused this combustion,\nplucked the roaring ostler from above Mrs. Dods, and pushing him away\nwith a hearty slap on the shoulder, proceeded to raise and encourage the\nfallen landlady, enquiring, at the same time, \"What, in the devil's\nname, was the cause of all this senseless confusion?\"\n\n\"And what is the reason, in Heaven's name,\" answered the matron, keeping\nher eyes firmly shut, and still shrewish in her expostulation, though in\nthe very extremity of terror, \"what is the reason that you should come\nand frighten a decent house, where you met naething, when ye was in the\nbody, but the height of civility?\"\n\n\"And why should I frighten you, Mrs. Dods? or, in one word, what is the\nmeaning of all this nonsensical terror?\"\n\n\"Are not you,\" said Mrs. Dods, opening her eyes a little as she spoke,\n\"the ghaist of Francis Tirl?\"\n\n\"I am Francis Tyrrel, unquestionably, my old friend.\"\n\n\"I kend it! I kend it!\" answered the honest woman, relapsing into her\nagony; \"and I think ye might be ashamed of yourself, that are a ghaist,\nand have nae better to do than to frighten a puir auld alewife.\"\n\n\"On my word, I am no ghost, but a living man,\" answered Tyrrel.\n\n\"Were ye no murdered than?\" demanded Mrs. Dods, still in an uncertain\nvoice, and only partially opening her eyes--\"Are ye very sure ye werena\nmurdered?\"\n\n\"Why, not that ever I heard of, certainly, dame,\" replied Tyrrel.\n\n\"But _I_ shall be murdered presently,\" said old Touchwood from the\nkitchen, where he had hitherto remained a mute auditor of this\nextraordinary scene--\"_I_ shall be murdered, unless you fetch me some\nwater without delay.\"\n\n\"Coming, sir, coming,\" answered Dame Dods, her professional reply being\nas familiar to her as that of poor Francis's \"Anon, anon, sir.\" \"As I\nlive by honest reckonings,\" said she, fully collecting herself, and\ngiving a glance of more composed temper at Tyrrel, \"I believe it _is_\nyoursell, Maister Frank, in blood and body after a'--And see if I dinna\ngie a proper sorting to yon twa silly jauds that gard me mak a bogle of\nyou, and a fule of mysell--Ghaists! my certie, I sall ghaist them--If\nthey had their heads as muckle on their wark as on their daffing, they\nwad play nae sic pliskies--it's the wanton steed that scaurs at the\nwindle-strae--Ghaists! wha e'er heard of ghaists in an honest house?\nNaebody need fear bogles that has a conscience void of offence.--But I\nam blithe that MacTurk hasna murdered ye when a' is done, Maister\nFrancie.\"\n\n\"Come this way, Mother Dods, if you would not have me do a mischief!\"\nexclaimed Touchwood, grasping a plate which stood on the dresser, as if\nhe were about to heave it at the landlady, by way of recalling her\nattention.\n\n\"For the love of Heaven, dinna break it!\" exclaimed the alarmed\nlandlady, knowing that Touchwood's effervescence of impatience sometimes\nexpended itself at the expense of her crockery, though it was afterwards\nliberally atoned for. \"Lord, sir, are ye out of your wits!--it breaks a\nset, ye ken--Godsake, put doun the cheeny plate, and try your hand on\nthe delf-ware!--it will just make as good a jingle--But, Lord haud a\ngrip o' us! now I look at ye, what can hae come ower ye, and what sort\nof a plight are ye in!--Wait till I fetch water and a towel.\"\n\nIn fact, the miserable guise of her new lodger now overcame the dame's\ncuriosity to enquire after the fate of her earlier acquaintance, and she\ngave her instant and exclusive attention to Mr. Touchwood, with many\nexclamations, while aiding him to perform the task of ablution and\nabstersion. Her two fugitive handmaidens had by this time returned to\nthe kitchen, and endeavoured to suppress a smuggled laugh at the\nrecollection of their mistress's panic, by acting very officiously in\nMr. Touchwood's service. By dint of washing and drying, the token of the\nsable stains was at length removed, and the veteran became, with some\ndifficulty, satisfied that he had been more dirtied and frightened than\nhurt.\n\nTyrrel, in the meantime, stood looking on with wonder, imagining that he\nbeheld in the features which emerged from a mask of mud, the countenance\nof an old friend. After the operation was ended, he could not help\naddressing himself to Mr. Touchwood, to demand whether he had not the\npleasure to see a friend, to whom he had been obliged when at Smyrna,\nfor some kindness respecting his money matters?\n\n\"Not worth speaking of--not worth speaking of,\" said Touchwood, hastily.\n\"Glad to see you, though--glad to see you.--Yes, here I am; you will\nfind me the same good-natured old fool that I was at Smyrna--never look\nhow I am to get in money again--always laying it out. Never mind--it was\nwritten in my forehead, as the Turk says.--I will go up now and change\nmy dress--you will sup with me when I come back--Mrs. Dods will toss us\nup something--a brandered fowl will be best, Mrs. Dods, with some\nmushrooms, and get us a jug of mulled wine--plottie, as you call it--to\nput the recollection of the old Presbyterian's common sewer out of my\nhead.\"\n\nSo saying, up stairs marched the traveller to his own apartment, while\nTyrrel, seizing upon a candle, was about to do the same.\n\n\"Mr. Touchwood is in the blue room, Mrs. Dods; I suppose I may take\npossession of the yellow one?\"\n\n\"Suppose naething about the matter, Maister Francis Tirl, till ye tell\nme downright where ye have been a' this time, and whether ye hae been\nmurdered or no?\"\n\n\"I think you may be pretty well satisfied of that, Mrs. Dods?\"\n\n\"Trot! and so I am in a sense; and yet it gars me grue to look upon ye,\nsae mony days and weeks it has been since I thought ye were rotten in\nthe moulds. And now to see ye standing before me hale and feir, and\ncrying for a bedroom like ither folk!\"\n\n\"One would almost suppose, my good friend,\" said Tyrrel, \"that you were\nsorry at my having come alive again.\"\n\n\"It's no for that,\" replied Mrs. Dods, who was peculiarly ingenious in\nthe mode of framing and stating what she conceived to be her grievances;\n\"but is it no a queer thing for a decent man like yoursell, Maister\nTirl, to be leaving your lodgings without a word spoken, and me put to\na' these charges in seeking for your dead body, and very near taking my\nbusiness out of honest Maister Bindloose's hands, because he kend the\ncantrips of the like of you better than I did?--And than they hae putten\nup an advertisement down at the Waal yonder, wi' a' their names at it,\nsetting ye forth, Maister Francie, as are of the greatest blackguards\nunhanged; and wha, div ye think, is to keep ye in a creditable house, if\nthat's the character ye get?\"\n\n\"You may leave that to me, Mrs. Dods--I assure you that matter shall be\nput to rights to your satisfaction; and I think, so long as we have\nknown each other, you may take my word that I am not undeserving the\nshelter of your roof for a single night, (I shall ask it no longer,)\nuntil my character is sufficiently cleared. It was for that purpose\nchiefly I came back again.\"\n\n\"Came back again!\" said Mrs. Dods.--\"I profess ye made me start, Maister\nTirl, and you looking sae pale, too.--But I think,\" she added, straining\nafter a joke, \"if ye were a ghaist, seeing we are such auld\nacquaintance, ye wadna wish to spoil my custom, but would just walk\ndecently up and down the auld castle wa's, or maybe down at the kirk\nyonder--there have been awfu' things done in that kirk and kirkyard--I\nwhiles dinna like to look that way, Maister Francie.\"\n\n\"I am much of your mind, mistress,\" said Tyrrel, with a sigh; \"and,\nindeed, I do in one resemble the apparitions you talk of; for, like\nthem, and to as little purpose, I stalk about scenes where my happiness\ndeparted.--But I speak riddles to you, Mrs. Dods--the plain truth is,\nthat I met with an accident on the day I last left your house, the\neffects of which detained me at some distance from St. Ronan's till this\nvery day.\"\n\n\"Hegh, sirs, and ye were sparing of your trouble, that wadna write a bit\nline, or send a bit message!--Ye might hae thought folk wad hae been\nvexed eneugh about ye, forby undertaking journeys, and hiring folk to\nseek for your dead body.\"\n\n\"I shall willingly pay all reasonable charges which my disappearance may\nhave occasioned,\" answered her guest; \"and I assure you, once for all,\nthat my remaining for some time quiet at Marchthorn, arose partly from\nillness, and partly from business of a very pressing and particular\nnature.\"\n\n\"At Marchthorn!\" exclaimed Dame Dods, \"heard ever man the like o'\nthat!--And where did ye put up in Marchthorn, an ane may mak' bauld to\nspeer?\"\n\n\"At the Black Bull,\" replied Tyrrel.\n\n\"Ay, that's auld Tam Lowrie's--a very decent man, Thamas--and a douce\ncreditable house--nane of your flisk-ma-hoys--I am glad ye made choice\nof sic gude quarters, neighbour; for I am beginning to think ye are but\na queer ane--ye look as if butter wadna melt in your mouth, but I sall\nwarrant cheese no choke ye.--But I'll thank ye to gang your ways into\nthe parlour, for I am no like to get muckle mair out o' ye, it's like;\nand ye are standing here just in the gate, when we hae the supper to\ndish.\"\n\nTyrrel, glad to be released from the examination to which his landlady's\ncuriosity had without ceremony subjected him, walked into the parlour,\nwhere he was presently joined by Mr. Touchwood, newly attired, and in\nhigh spirits.\n\n\"Here comes our supper!\" he exclaimed.--\"Sit ye down, and let us see\nwhat Mrs. Dods has done for us.--I profess, mistress, your plottie is\nexcellent, ever since I taught you to mix the spices in the right\nproportion.\"\n\n\"I am glad the plottie pleases ye, sir--but I think I kend gay weel how\nto make it before I saw your honour--Maister Tirl can tell that, for\nmony a browst of it I hae brewed lang syne for him and the callant\nValentine Bulmer.\"\n\nThis ill-timed observation extorted a groan from Tyrrel; but the\ntraveller, running on with his own recollections, did not appear to\nnotice his emotion.\n\n\"You are a conceited old woman,\" said Mr. Touchwood; \"how the devil\nshould any one know how to mix spices so well as he who has been where\nthey grow?--I have seen the sun ripening nutmegs and cloves, and here,\nit can hardly fill a peasecod, by Jupiter. Ah, Tyrrel, the merry nights\nwe have had at Smyrna!--Gad, I think the gammon and the good wine taste\nall the better in a land where folks hold them to be sinful\nindulgences--Gad, I believe many a good Moslem is of the same\nopinion--that same prohibition of their prophet's gives a flavour to the\nham, and a relish to the Cyprus.--Do you remember old Cogia Hassein,\nwith his green turban?--I once played him a trick, and put a pint of\nbrandy into his sherbet. Egad, the old fellow took care never to\ndiscover the cheat until he had got to the bottom of the flagon, and\nthen he strokes his long white beard, and says, 'Ullah Kerim,'--that\nis, 'Heaven is merciful,' Mrs. Dods, Mr. Tyrrel knows the meaning of\nit.--Ullah Kerim, says he, after he had drunk about a gallon of\nbrandy-punch!--Ullah Kerim, says the hypocritical old rogue, as if he\nhad done the finest thing in the world!\"\n\n\"And what for no? What for shouldna the honest man say a blessing after\nhis drap punch?\" demanded Mrs. Dods; \"it was better, I ween, than\nblasting, and blawing, and swearing, as if folks shouldna be thankful\nfor the creature comforts.\"\n\n\"Well said, old Dame Dods,\" replied the traveller; \"that is a right\nhostess's maxim, and worthy of Mrs. Quickly herself. Here is to thee,\nand I pray ye to pledge me before ye leave the room.\"\n\n\"Troth, I'll pledge naebody the night, Maister Touchwood; for, what wi'\nthe upcast and terror that I got a wee while syne, and what wi' the bit\ntaste that I behoved to take of the plottie while I was making it, my\nhead is sair eneugh distressed the night already.--Maister Tirl, the\nyellow room is ready for ye when ye like; and, gentlemen, as the morn is\nthe Sabbath, I canna be keeping the servant queans out of their beds to\nwait on ye ony langer, for they will mak it an excuse for lying till\naught o'clock on the Lord's day. So, when your plottie is done, I'll be\nmuckle obliged to ye to light the bedroom candles, and put out the\ndouble moulds, and e'en show yoursells to your beds; for douce folks,\nsic as the like of you, should set an example by ordinary.--And so,\ngude-night to ye baith.\"\n\n\"By my faith,\" said Touchwood, as she withdrew, \"our dame turns as\nobstinate as a Pacha with three tails!--We have her gracious permission\nto finish our mug, however; so here is to your health once more, Mr.\nTyrrel, wishing you a hearty welcome to your own country.\"\n\n\"I thank you, Mr. Touchwood,\" answered Tyrrel; \"and I return you the\nsame good wishes, with, as I sincerely hope, a much greater chance of\ntheir being realized.--You relieved me, sir, at a time when the villainy\nof an agent, prompted, as I have reason to think, by an active and\npowerful enemy, occasioned my being, for a time, pressed for funds.--I\nmade remittances to the _Ragion_ you dealt with, to acquit myself at\nleast of the pecuniary part of my obligation; but the bills were\nreturned, because, it was stated, you had left Smyrna.\"\n\n\"Very true--very true--left Smyrna, and here I am in Scotland--as for\nthe bills, we will speak of them another time--something due for picking\nme out of the gutter.\"\n\n\"I shall make no deduction on that account,\" said Tyrrel, smiling,\nthough in no jocose mood; \"and I beg you not to mistake me. The\ncircumstances of embarrassment, under which you found me at Smyrna, were\nmerely temporary--I am most able and willing to pay my debt; and, let me\nadd, I am most desirous to do so.\"\n\n\"Another time--another time,\" said Mr. Touchwood--\"time enough before\nus, Mr. Tyrrel--besides, at Smyrna, you talked of a lawsuit--law is a\nlick-penny, Mr. Tyrrel--no counsellor like the pound in purse.\"\n\n\"For my lawsuit,\" said Tyrrel, \"I am fully provided.\"\n\n\"But have you good advice?--Have you good advice?\" said Touchwood;\n\"answer me that.\"\n\n\"I have advised with my lawyers,\" answered Tyrrel, internally vexed to\nfind that his friend was much disposed to make his generosity upon the\nformer occasion a pretext for prying farther into his affairs now than\nhe thought polite or convenient.\n\n\"With your counsel learned in the law--eh, my dear boy? But the advice\nyou should take is of some travelled friend, well acquainted with\nmankind and the world--some one that has lived double your years, and is\nmaybe looking out for some bare young fellow that he may do a little\ngood to--one that might be willing to help you farther than I can\npretend to guess--for, as to your lawyer, you get just your guinea's\nworth from him--not even so much as the baker's bargain, thirteen to the\ndozen.\"\n\n\"I think I should not trouble myself to go far in search of a friend\nsuch as you describe,\" said Tyrrel, who could not affect to\nmisunderstand the senior's drift, \"when I was near Mr. Peregrine\nTouchwood; but the truth is, my affairs are at present so much\ncomplicated with those of others, whose secrets I have no right to\ncommunicate, that I cannot have the advantage of consulting you, or any\nother friend. It is possible I may be soon obliged to lay aside this\nreserve, and vindicate myself before the whole public. I will not fail,\nwhen that time shall arrive, to take an early opportunity of\nconfidential communication with you.\"\n\n\"That is right--confidential is the word--No person ever made a\nconfidant of me who repented it--Think what the Pacha might have made of\nit, had he taken my advice, and cut through the Isthmus of Suez.--Turk\nand Christian, men of all tongues and countries, used to consult old\nTouchwood, from the building of a mosque down to the settling of an\n_agio_.--But come--Good-night--good-night.\"\n\nSo saying, he took up his bedroom light, and extinguished one of those\nwhich stood on the table, nodded to Tyrrel to discharge his share of the\nduty imposed by Mrs. Dods with the same punctuality, and they withdrew\nto their several apartments, entertaining very different sentiments of\neach other.\n\n\"A troublesome, inquisitive old gentleman,\" said Tyrrel to himself; \"I\nremember him narrowly escaping the bastinado at Smyrna, for thrusting\nhis advice on the Turkish cadi--and then I lie under a considerable\nobligation to him, giving him a sort of right to annoy me--Well, I must\nparry his impertinence as I can.\"\n\n\"A shy cock this Frank Tyrrel,\" thought the traveller; \"a very complete\ndodger!--But no matter--I shall wind him, were he to double like a\nfox--I am resolved to make his matters my own, and if _I_ cannot carry\nhim through, I know not who can.\"\n\nHaving formed this philanthropic resolution, Mr. Touchwood threw himself\ninto bed, which luckily declined exactly at the right angle, and, full\nof self-complacency, consigned himself to slumber.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X.\n\nMEDIATION.\n\n    --------So, begone!\n    We will not now be troubled with reply;\n    We offer fair, take it advisedly.\n\n_King Henry IV. Part I._\n\n\nIt had been the purpose of Tyrrel, by rising and breakfasting early, to\navoid again meeting Mr. Touchwood, having upon his hands a matter in\nwhich that officious gentleman's interference was likely to prove\ntroublesome. His character, he was aware, had been assailed at the Spa\nin the most public manner, and in the most public manner he was resolved\nto demand redress, conscious that whatever other important concerns had\nbrought him to Scotland, must necessarily be postponed to the\nvindication of his honour. He was determined, for this purpose, to go\ndown to the rooms when the company was assembled at the breakfast hour,\nand had just taken his hat to set out, when he was interrupted by Mrs.\nDods, who, announcing \"a gentleman that was speering for him,\" ushered\ninto the chamber a very fashionable young man in a military surtout,\ncovered with silk lace and fur, and wearing a foraging-cap; a dress now\ntoo familiar to be distinguished, but which at that time was used only\nby geniuses of a superior order. The stranger was neither handsome nor\nplain, but had in his appearance a good deal of pretension, and the cool\neasy superiority which belongs to high breeding. On his part, he\nsurveyed Tyrrel; and, as his appearance differed, perhaps, from that for\nwhich the exterior of the Cleikum Inn had prepared him, he abated\nsomething of the air with which he had entered the room, and politely\nannounced himself as Captain Jekyl, of the ---- Guards, (presenting, at\nthe same time, his ticket.)\n\n\"He presumed he spoke to Mr. Martigny?\"\n\n\"To Mr. Francis Tyrrel, sir,\" replied Tyrrel, drawing himself\nup--\"Martigny was my mother's name--I have never borne it.\"\n\n\"I am not here for the purpose of disputing that point, Mr. Tyrrel,\nthough I am not entitled to admit what my principal's information leads\nhim to doubt.\"\n\n\"Your principal, I presume, is Sir Bingo Binks?\" said Tyrrel. \"I have\nnot forgotten that there is an unfortunate affair between us.\"\n\n\"I have not the honour to know Sir Bingo Binks,\" said Captain Jekyl. \"I\ncome on the part of the Earl of Etherington.\"\n\nTyrrel stood silent for a moment, and then said, \"I am at a loss to know\nwhat the gentleman who calls himself Earl of Etherington can have to say\nto me, through the medium of such a messenger as yourself, Captain\nJekyl. I should have supposed that, considering our unhappy\nrelationship, and the terms on which we stand towards each other, the\nlawyers were the fitter negotiators between us.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Captain Jekyl, \"you are misunderstanding my errand. I am\ncome on no message of hostile import from Lord Etherington--I am aware\nof the connexion betwixt you, which would render such an office\naltogether contradictory to common sense and the laws of nature; and I\nassure you, I would lay down my life rather than be concerned in an\naffair so unnatural. I would act, if possible, as a mediator betwixt\nyou.\"\n\nThey had hitherto remained standing. Mr. Tyrrel now offered his guest a\nseat; and, having assumed one himself, he broke the awkward pause which\nensued by observing, \"I should be happy, after experiencing such a long\ncourse of injustice and persecution from your friend, to learn, even at\nthis late period, Captain Jekyl, any thing which can make me think\nbetter, either of him, or of his purpose towards me and towards others.\"\n\n\"Mr. Tyrrel,\" said Captain Jekyl, \"you must allow me to speak with\ncandour. There is too great a stake betwixt your brother and you to\npermit you to be friends; but I do not see it is necessary that you\nshould therefore be mortal enemies.\"\n\n\"I am not my brother's enemy, Captain Jekyl,\" said Tyrrel--\"I have never\nbeen so--His friend I cannot be, and he knows but too well the\ninsurmountable barrier which his own conduct has placed between us.\"\n\n\"I am aware,\" said Captain Jekyl, slowly and expressively, \"generally,\nat least, of the particulars of your unfortunate disagreement.\"\n\n\"If so,\" said Tyrrel, colouring, \"you must be also aware with what\nextreme pain I feel myself compelled to enter on such a subject with a\ntotal stranger--a stranger, too, the friend and confidant of one\nwho----But I will not hurt your feelings, Captain Jekyl, but rather\nendeavour to suppress my own. In one word, I beg to be favoured with the\nimport of your communication, as I am obliged to go down to the Spa this\nmorning, in order to put to rights some matters there which concern me\nnearly.\"\n\n\"If you mean the cause of your absence from an appointment with Sir\nBingo Binks,\" said Captain Jekyl, \"the matter has been already\ncompletely explained. I pulled down the offensive placard with my own\nhand, and rendered myself responsible for your honour to any one who\nshould presume to hold it in future doubt.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Tyrrel, very much surprised, \"I am obliged to you for your\nintention, the more so as I am ignorant how I have merited such\ninterference. It is not, however, quite satisfactory to me, because I am\naccustomed to be the guardian of my own honour.\"\n\n\"An easy task, I presume, in all cases, Mr. Tyrrel,\" answered Jekyl,\n\"but peculiarly so in the present, when you will find no one so hardy as\nto assail it.--My interference, indeed, would have been unjustifiably\nofficious, had I not been at the moment undertaking a commission\nimplying confidential intercourse with you. For the sake of my own\ncharacter, it became necessary to establish yours. I know the truth of\nthe whole affair from my friend, the Earl of Etherington, who ought to\nthank Heaven so long as he lives, that saved him on that occasion from\nthe commission of a very great crime.\"\n\n\"Your friend, sir, has had, in the course of his life, much to thank\nHeaven for, but more for which to ask God's forgiveness.\"\n\n\"I am no divine, sir,\" replied Captain Jekyl, with spirit; \"but I have\nbeen told that the same may be said of most men alive.\"\n\n\"I, at least, cannot dispute it,\" said Tyrrel; \"but, to proceed.--Have\nyou found yourself at liberty, Captain Jekyl, to deliver to the public\nthe whole particulars of a rencontre so singular as that which took\nplace between your friend and me?\"\n\n\"I have not, sir,\" said Jekyl--\"I judged it a matter of great delicacy,\nand which each of you had the like interest to preserve secret.\"\n\n\"May I beg to know, then,\" said Tyrrel, \"how it was possible for you to\nvindicate my absence from Sir Bingo's rendezvous otherwise?\"\n\n\"It was only necessary, sir, to pledge my word as a gentleman and a man\nof honour, characters in which I am pretty well known to the world,\nthat, to my certain personal knowledge, you were hurt in an affair with\na friend of mine, the further particulars of which prudence required\nshould be sunk into oblivion. I think no one will venture to dispute my\nword, or to require more than my assurance.--If there should be any one\nvery hard of faith on the occasion, I shall find a way to satisfy him.\nIn the meanwhile, your outlawry has been rescinded in the most\nhonourable manner; and Sir Bingo, in consideration of his share in\ngiving rise to reports so injurious to you, is desirous to drop all\nfurther proceedings in his original quarrel, and hopes the whole matter\nwill be forgot and forgiven on all sides.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, Captain Jekyl,\" answered Tyrrel, \"you lay me under the\nnecessity of acknowledging obligation to you. You have cut a knot which\nI should have found it very difficult to unloose; for I frankly confess,\nthat, while I was determined not to remain under the stigma put upon me,\nI should have had great difficulty in clearing myself, without\nmentioning circumstances, which, were it only for the sake of my\nfather's memory, should be buried in eternal oblivion. I hope your\nfriend feels no continued inconvenience from his hurt?\"\n\n\"His lordship is nearly quite recovered,\" said Jekyl.\n\n\"And I trust he did me the justice to own, that, so far as my will was\nconcerned, I am totally guiltless of the purpose of hurting him?\"\n\n\"He does you full justice in that and every thing else,\" replied Jekyl;\n\"regrets the impetuosity of his own temper, and is determined to be on\nhis guard against it in future.\"\n\n\"That,\" said Tyrrel, \"is so far well; and now, may I ask once more, what\ncommunication you have to make to me on the part of your friend?--Were\nit from any one but him, whom I have found so uniformly false and\ntreacherous, your own fairness and candour would induce me to hope that\nthis unnatural quarrel might be in some sort ended by your mediation.\"\n\n\"I then proceed, sir, under more favourable auspices than I expected,\"\nsaid Captain Jekyl, \"to enter on my commission.--You are about to\ncommence a lawsuit, Mr. Tyrrel, if fame does not wrong you, for the\npurpose of depriving your brother of his estate and title.\"\n\n\"The case is not fairly stated, Captain Jekyl,\" replied Tyrrel; \"I\ncommence a lawsuit, when I do commence it, for the sake of ascertaining\nmy own just rights.\"\n\n\"It comes to the same thing eventually,\" said the mediator; \"I am not\ncalled upon to decide upon the justice of your claims, but they are, you\nwill allow, newly started. The late Countess of Etherington died in\npossession--open and undoubted possession--of her rank in society.\"\n\n\"If she had no real claim to it, sir,\" replied Tyrrel, \"she had more\nthan justice who enjoyed it so long; and the injured lady whose claims\nwere postponed, had just so much less.--But this is no point for you and\nme to discuss between us--it must be tried elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Proofs, sir, of the strongest kind, will be necessary to overthrow a\nright so well established in public opinion as that of the present\npossessor of the title of Etherington.\"\n\nTyrrel took a paper from his pocketbook, and, handing it to Captain\nJekyl, only answered, \"I have no thoughts of asking you to give up the\ncause of your friend; but methinks the documents of which I give you a\nlist, may shake your opinion of it.\"\n\nCaptain Jekyl read, muttering to himself, \"'_Certificate of marriage, by\nthe Rev. Zadock Kemp, chaplain to the British Embassy at Paris, between\nMarie de Bellroche, Comptesse de Martigny, and the Right Honourable John\nLord Oakendale--Letters between John Earl of Etherington and his lady,\nunder the title of Madame de Martigny--Certificate of baptism--Declaration\nof the Earl of Etherington on his death-bed._'--All this is very\nwell--but may I ask you, Mr. Tyrrel, if it is really your purpose to go\nto extremity with your brother?\"\n\n\"He has forgot that he is one--he has lifted his hand against my life.\"\n\n\"You have shed his blood--twice shed it,\" said Jekyl; \"the world will\nnot ask which brother gave the offence, but which received, which\ninflicted, the severest wound.\"\n\n\"Your friend has inflicted one on me, sir,\" said Tyrrel, \"that will\nbleed while I have the power of memory.\"\n\n\"I understand you, sir,\" said Captain Jekyl; \"you mean the affair of\nMiss Mowbray?\"\n\n\"Spare me on that subject, sir!\" said Tyrrel. \"Hitherto I have disputed\nmy most important rights--rights which involved my rank in society, my\nfortune, the honour of my mother--with something like composure; but do\nnot say more on the topic you have touched upon, unless you would have\nbefore you a madman!--Is it possible for you, sir, to have heard even\nthe outline of this story, and to imagine that I can ever reflect on the\ncold-blooded and most inhuman stratagem, which this friend of yours\nprepared for two unfortunates, without\"--He started up, and walked\nimpetuously to and fro. \"Since the Fiend himself interrupted the\nhappiness of perfect innocence, there was never such an act of\ntreachery--never such schemes of happiness destroyed--never such\ninevitable misery prepared for two wretches who had the idiocy to repose\nperfect confidence in him!--Had there been passion in his conduct, it\nhad been the act of a man--a wicked man, indeed, but still a human\ncreature, acting under the influence of human feelings--but his was the\ndeed of a calm, cold, calculating demon, actuated by the basest and most\nsordid motives of self-interest, joined, as I firmly believe, to an\nearly and inveterate hatred of one whose claims he considered as at\nvariance with his own.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to see you in such a temper,\" said Captain Jekyl, calmly;\n\"Lord Etherington, I trust, acted on very different motives than those\nyou impute to him; and if you will but listen to me, perhaps something\nmay be struck out which may accommodate these unhappy disputes.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Tyrrel, sitting down again, \"I will listen to you with\ncalmness, as I would remain calm under the probe of a surgeon tenting a\nfestered wound. But when you touch me to the quick, when you prick the\nvery nerve, you cannot expect me to endure without wincing.\"\n\n\"I will endeavour, then, to be as brief in the operation as I can,\"\nreplied Captain Jekyl, who possessed the advantage of the most admirable\ncomposure during the whole conference. \"I conclude, Mr. Tyrrel, that the\npeace, happiness, and honour of Miss Mowbray, are dear to you?\"\n\n\"Who dare impeach her honour!\" said Tyrrel, fiercely; then checking\nhimself, added, in a more moderate tone, but one of deep feeling, \"they\nare dear to me, sir, as my eyesight.\"\n\n\"My friend holds them in equal regard,\" said the Captain; \"and has come\nto the resolution of doing her the most ample justice.\"\n\n\"He can do her justice no otherwise, than by ceasing to haunt this\nneighbourhood, to think, to speak, even to dream of her.\"\n\n\"Lord Etherington thinks otherwise,\" said Captain Jekyl; \"he believes\nthat if Miss Mowbray has sustained any wrong at his hands, which, of\ncourse, I am not called upon to admit, it will be best repaired by the\noffer to share with her his title, his rank, and his fortune.\"\n\n\"His title, rank, and fortune, sir, are as much a falsehood as he is\nhimself,\" said Tyrrel, with violence--\"Marry Clara Mowbray? never!\"\n\n\"My friend's fortune, you will observe,\" replied Jekyl, \"does not rest\nentirely upon the event of the lawsuit with which you, Mr. Tyrrel, now\nthreaten him.--Deprive him, if you can, of the Oakendale estate, he has\nstill a large patrimony by his mother; and besides, as to his marriage\nwith Clara Mowbray, he conceives, that unless it should be the lady's\nwish to have the ceremony repeated to which he is most desirous to defer\nhis own opinion, they have only to declare that it has already passed\nbetween them.\"\n\n\"A trick, sir!\" said Tyrrel, \"a vile infamous trick! of which the lowest\nwretch in Newgate would be ashamed--the imposition of one person for\nanother.\"\n\n\"Of that, Mr. Tyrrel, I have seen no evidence whatever. The clergyman's\ncertificate is clear--Francis Tyrrel is united to Clara Mowbray in the\nholy bands of wedlock--such is the tenor--there is a copy--nay, stop one\ninstant, if you please, sir. You say there was an imposition in the\ncase--I have no doubt but you speak what you believe, and what Miss\nMowbray told you. She was surprised--forced in some measure from the\nhusband she had just married--ashamed to meet her former lover, to whom,\ndoubtless, she had made many a vow of love, and ne'er a true one--what\nwonder that, unsupported by her bridegroom, she should have changed her\ntone, and thrown all the blame of her own inconstancy on the absent\nswain?--A woman, at a pinch so critical, will make the most improbable\nexcuse, rather than be found guilty on her own confession.\"\n\n\"There must be no jesting in this case,\" said Tyrrel, his cheek becoming\npale, and his voice altered with passion.\n\n\"I am quite serious, sir,\" replied Jekyl; \"and there is no law court in\nBritain that would take the lady's word--all she has to offer, and that\nin her own cause--against a whole body of evidence direct and\ncircumstantial, showing that she was by her own free consent married to\nthe gentleman who now claims her hand.--Forgive me, sir--I see you are\nmuch agitated--I do not mean to dispute your right of believing what you\nthink is most credible--I only use the freedom of pointing out to you\nthe impression which the evidence is likely to make on the minds of\nindifferent persons.\"\n\n\"Your friend,\" answered Tyrrel, affecting a composure, which, however,\nhe was far from possessing, \"may think by such arguments to screen his\nvillainy; but it cannot avail him--the truth is known to Heaven--it is\nknown to me--and there is, besides, one indifferent witness upon earth,\nwho can testify that the most abominable imposition was practised on\nMiss Mowbray.\"\n\n\"You mean her cousin,--Hannah Irwin, I think, is her name,\" answered\nJekyl; \"you see I am fully acquainted with all the circumstances of the\ncase. But where is Hannah Irwin to be found?\"\n\n\"She will appear, doubtless, in Heaven's good time, and to the confusion\nof him who now imagines the only witness of his treachery--the only one\nwho could tell the truth of this complicated mystery--either no longer\nlives, or, at least, cannot be brought forward against him, to the ruin\nof his schemes. Yes, sir, that slight observation of yours has more than\nexplained to me why your friend, or, to call him by his true name, Mr.\nValentine Bulmer, has not commenced his machinations sooner, and also\nwhy he has commenced them now. He thinks himself certain that Hannah\nIrwin is not now in Britain, or to be produced in a court of justice--he\nmay find himself mistaken.\"\n\n\"My friend seems perfectly confident of the issue of his cause,\"\nanswered Jekyl; \"but for the lady's sake, he is most unwilling to\nprosecute a suit which must be attended with so many circumstances of\npainful exposure.\"\n\n\"Exposure, indeed!\" answered Tyrrel; \"thanks to the traitor who laid a\nmine so fearful, and who now affects to be reluctant to fire it.--Oh!\nhow I am bound to curse that affinity that restrains my hands! I would\nbe content to be the meanest and vilest of society, for one hour of\nvengeance on this unexampled hypocrite!--One thing is certain, sir--your\nfriend will have no living victim. His persecution will kill Clara\nMowbray, and fill up the cup of his crimes, with the murder of one of\nthe sweetest----I shall grow a woman, if I say more on the subject!\"\n\n\"My friend,\" said Jekyl, \"since you like best to have him so defined, is\nas desirous as you can be to spare the lady's feelings; and with that\nview, not reverting to former passages, he has laid before her brother a\nproposal of alliance, with which Mr. Mowbray is highly pleased.\"\n\n\"Ha!\" said Tyrrel, starting--\"And the lady?\"--\n\n\"And the lady so far proved favourable, as to consent that Lord\nEtherington shall visit Shaws-Castle.\"\n\n\"Her consent must have been extorted!\" exclaimed Tyrrel.\n\n\"It was given voluntarily,\" said Jekyl, \"as I am led to understand;\nunless, perhaps, in so far as the desire to veil these very unpleasing\ntransactions may have operated, I think naturally enough, to induce her\nto sink them in eternal secrecy, by accepting Lord Etherington's\nhand.--I see, sir, I give you pain, and am sorry for it.--I have no\ntitle to call upon you for any exertion of generosity; but, should such\nbe Miss Mowbray's sentiments, is it too much to expect of you, that you\nwill not compromise the lady's honour by insisting upon former claims,\nand opening up disreputable transactions so long past?\"\n\n\"Captain Jekyl,\" said Tyrrel, solemnly, \"I have no claims. Whatever I\nmight have had, were cancelled by the act of treachery through which\nyour friend endeavoured too successfully to supplant me. Were Clara\nMowbray as free from her pretended marriage as law could pronounce her,\nstill with me--_me_, at least, of all men in the world--the obstacle\nmust ever remain, that the nuptial benediction has been pronounced over\nher, and the man whom I must for once call _brother_.\"--He stopped at\nthat word, as if it had cost him agony to pronounce it, and then\nresumed:--\"No, sir, I have no views of personal advantage in this\nmatter--they have been long annihilated--But I will not permit Clara\nMowbray to become the wife of a villain--I will watch over her with\nthoughts as spotless as those of her guardian angel. I first persuaded\nher to quit the path of duty[II-B]--I, of all men who live, am bound to\nprotect her from the misery--from the guilt--which must attach to her as\nthis man's wife. I will never believe that she wishes it--I will never\nbelieve, that in calm mind and sober reason, she can be brought to\nlisten to such a guilty proposal.--But her mind--alas!--is not of the\nfirm texture it once could boast; and your friend knows well how to\npress on the spring of every passion that can agitate and alarm her.\nThreats of exposure may extort her consent to this most unfitting\nmatch, if they do not indeed drive her to suicide, which I think the\nmost likely termination. I will, therefore, be strong where she is\nweak.--Your friend, sir, must at least strip his proposals of their fine\ngilding. I will satisfy Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's of his false\npretences, both to rank and fortune; and I rather think he will protect\nhis sister against the claim of a needy profligate, though he might be\ndazzled with the alliance of a wealthy peer.\"\n\n\"Your cause, sir, is not yet won,\" answered Jekyl; \"and when it is, your\nbrother will retain property enough to entitle him to marry a greater\nmatch than Miss Mowbray, besides the large estate of Nettlewood, to\nwhich that alliance must give him right. But I would wish to make some\naccommodation between you if it were possible. You profess, Mr. Tyrrel,\nto lay aside all selfish wishes and views in this matter, and to look\nentirely to Miss Mowbray's safety and happiness?\"\n\n\"Such, upon my honour, is the exclusive purpose of my interference--I\nwould give all I am worth to procure her an hour of quiet--for happiness\nshe will never know again.\"\n\n\"Your anticipations of Miss Mowbray's distress,\" said Jekyl, \"are, I\nunderstand, founded upon the character of my friend. You think him a man\nof light principle, and because he overreached you in a juvenile\nintrigue, you conclude that now, in his more steady and advanced years,\nthe happiness of the lady in whom you are so much interested ought not\nto be trusted to him?\"\n\n\"There may be other grounds,\" said Tyrrel, hastily; \"but you may argue\nupon those you have named, as sufficient to warrant my interference.\"\n\n\"How, then, if I should propose some accommodation of this nature? Lord\nEtherington does not pretend to the ardour of a passionate lover. He\nlives much in the world, and has no desire to quit it. Miss Mowbray's\nhealth is delicate--her spirits variable--and retirement would most\nprobably be her choice.--Suppose--I am barely putting a\nsupposition--suppose that a marriage between two persons so\ncircumstanced were rendered necessary or advantageous to both--suppose\nthat such a marriage were to secure to one party a large estate--were to\ninsure the other against all the consequences of an unpleasant\nexposure--still, both ends might be obtained by the mere ceremony of\nmarriage passing between them. There might be a previous contract of\nseparation, with suitable provisions for the lady, and stipulations, by\nwhich the husband should renounce all claim to her society. Such things\nhappen every season, if not on the very marriage day, yet before the\nhoneymoon is over.--Wealth and freedom would be the lady's, and as much\nrank as you, sir, supposing your claims just, may think proper to leave\nthem.\"\n\nThere was a long pause, during which Tyrrel underwent many changes of\ncountenance, which Jekyl watched carefully, without pressing him for an\nanswer. At length he replied, \"There is much in your proposal, Captain\nJekyl, which I might be tempted to accede to, as one manner of unloosing\nthis Gordian knot, and a compromise by which Miss Mowbray's future\ntranquillity would be in some degree provided for. But I would rather\ntrust a fanged adder than your friend, unless I saw him fettered by the\nstrongest ties of interest. Besides, I am certain the unhappy lady could\nnever survive the being connected with him in this manner, though but\nfor the single moment when they should appear together at the altar.\nThere are other objections\"----\n\nHe checked himself, paused, and then proceeded in a calm and\nself-possessed tone. \"You think, perhaps, even yet, that I have some\nselfish and interested views in this business; and probably you may feel\nyourself entitled to entertain the same suspicion towards me, which I\navowedly harbour respecting every proposition which originates with your\nfriend.--I cannot help it--I can but meet these disadvantageous\nimpressions with plain dealing and honesty; and it is in the spirit of\nboth that _I_ make a proposition to _you_.--Your friend is attached to\nrank, fortune, and worldly advantages, in the usual proportion, at\nleast, in which they are pursued by men of the world--this you must\nadmit, and I will not offend you by supposing more.\"\n\n\"I know few people who do not desire such advantages,\" answered Captain\nJekyl; \"and I frankly own, that he affects no particular degree of\nphilosophic indifference respecting them.\"\n\n\"Be it so,\" answered Tyrrel. \"Indeed, the proposal you have just made\nindicates that his pretended claim on this young lady's hand is\nentirely, or almost entirely, dictated by motives of interest, since you\nare of opinion that he would be contented to separate from her society\non the very marriage day, provided that, in doing so, he was assured of\nthe Nettlewood property.\"\n\n\"My proposition was unauthorized by my principal,\" answered Jekyl; \"but\nit is needless to deny, that its very tenor implies an idea, on my part,\nthat Lord Etherington is no passionate lover.\"\n\n\"Well then,\" answered Tyrrel. \"Consider, sir, and let him consider well,\nthat the estate and rank he now assumes, depend upon my will and\npleasure--that, if I prosecute the claims of which that scroll makes you\naware, he must descend from the rank of an earl into that of a commoner,\nstripped of by much the better half of his fortune--a diminution which\nwould be far from compensated by the estate of Nettlewood, even if he\ncould obtain it, which could only be by means of a lawsuit, precarious\nin the issue, and most dishonourable in its very essence.\"\n\n\"Well, sir,\" replied Jekyl, \"I perceive your argument--What is your\nproposal?\"\n\n\"That I will abstain from prosecuting my claim on those honours and that\nproperty--that I will leave Valentine Bulmer in possession of his\nusurped title and ill-deserved wealth--that I will bind myself under the\nstrongest penalties never to disturb his possession of the Earldom of\nEtherington and estates belonging to it--on condition that he allows the\nwoman, whose peace of mind he has ruined for ever, to walk through the\nworld in her wretchedness, undisturbed either by his marriage-suit, or\nby any claim founded upon his own most treacherous conduct--in short,\nthat he forbear to molest Clara Mowbray, either by his presence, word,\nletter, or through the intervention of a third party, and be to her in\nfuture as if he did not exist.\"\n\n\"This is a singular offer,\" said the Captain; \"may I ask if you are\nserious in making it?\"\n\n\"I am neither surprised nor offended at the question,\" said Tyrrel. \"I\nam a man, sir, like others, and affect no superiority to that which all\nmen desire the possession of--a certain consideration and station in\nsociety. I am no romantic fool to undervalue the sacrifice I am about to\nmake. I renounce a rank, which is and ought to be the more valuable to\nme, because it involves (he blushed as he spoke) the fame of an honoured\nmother--because, in failing to claim it, I disobey the commands of a\ndying father, who wished that by doing so I should declare to the world\nthe penitence which hurried him perhaps to the grave, and the making\nwhich public he considered might be some atonement for his errors. From\nan honoured place in the land, I descend voluntarily to become a\nnameless exile; for, once certain that Clara Mowbray's peace is assured,\nBritain no longer holds me.--All this I do, sir, not in any idle strain\nof overheated feeling, but seeing, and knowing, and dearly valuing,\nevery advantage which I renounce--yet I do it, and do it willingly,\nrather than be the cause of farther evil to one, on whom I have already\nbrought too--too much.\"\n\nHis voice, in spite of his exertions, faltered as he concluded the\nsentence, and a big drop which rose to his eye, required him for the\nmoment to turn towards the window.\n\n\"I am ashamed of this childishness,\" he said, turning again to Captain\nJekyl; \"if it excites your ridicule, sir, let it be at least a proof of\nmy sincerity.\"\n\n\"I am far from entertaining such sentiments,\" said Jekyl,\nrespectfully--for, in a long train of fashionable follies, his heart had\nnot been utterly hardened--\"very far, indeed. To a proposal so singular\nas yours, I cannot be expected to answer--except thus far--the character\nof the peerage is, I believe, indelible, and cannot be resigned or\nassumed at pleasure. If you are really Earl of Etherington, I cannot see\nhow your resigning the right may avail my friend.\"\n\n\"You, sir, it might not avail,\" said Tyrrel, gravely, \"because you,\nperhaps, might scorn to exercise a right, or hold a title, that was not\nlegally yours. But your friend will have no such compunctious visitings.\nIf he can act the Earl to the eye of the world, he has already shown\nthat his honour and conscience will be easily satisfied.\"\n\n\"May I take a copy of the memorandum containing this list of documents,\"\nsaid Captain Jekyl, \"for the information of my constituent?\"\n\n\"The paper is at your pleasure, sir,\" replied Tyrrel; \"it is itself but\na copy.--But Captain Jekyl,\" he added, with a sarcastic expression, \"is,\nit would seem, but imperfectly let into his friend's confidence--he may\nbe assured his principal is completely acquainted with the contents of\nthis paper, and has accurate copies of the deeds to which it refers.\"\n\n\"I think it scarce possible,\" said Jekyl, angrily.\n\n\"Possible and certain!\" answered Tyrrel. \"My father, shortly preceding\nhis death, sent me--with a most affecting confession of his errors--this\nlist of papers, and acquainted me that he had made a similar\ncommunication to your friend. That he did so I have no doubt, however\nMr. Bulmer may have thought proper to disguise the circumstance in\ncommunication with you. One circumstance, among others, stamps at once\nhis character, and confirms me of the danger he apprehended by my return\nto Britain. He found means, through a scoundrelly agent, who had made me\nthe usual remittances from my father while alive, to withhold those\nwhich were necessary for my return from the Levant, and I was obliged\nto borrow from a friend.\"\n\n\"Indeed?\" replied Jekyl. \"It is the first time I have heard of these\npapers--May I enquire where the originals are, and in whose custody?\"\n\n\"I was in the East,\" answered Tyrrel, \"during my father's last illness,\nand these papers were by him deposited with a respectable commercial\nhouse, with which he was connected. They were enclosed in a cover\ndirected to me, and that again in an envelope, addressed to the\nprincipal person in their firm.\"\n\n\"You must be sensible,\" said Captain Jekyl, \"that I can scarcely decide\non the extraordinary offer which you have been pleased to make, of\nresigning the claim founded on these documents, unless I had a previous\nopportunity of examining them.\"\n\n\"You shall have that opportunity--I will write to have them sent down by\nthe post--they lie but in small compass.\"\n\n\"This, then,\" said the Captain, \"sums up all that can be said at\npresent.--Supposing these proofs to be of unexceptionable authenticity,\nI certainly would advise my friend Etherington to put to sleep a claim\nso important as yours, even at the expense of resigning his matrimonial\nspeculation--I presume you design to abide by your offer?\"\n\n\"I am not in the habit of altering my mind--still less of retracting my\nword,\" said Tyrrel, somewhat haughtily.\n\n\"We part friends, I hope?\" said Jekyl, rising, and taking his leave.\n\n\"Not enemies certainly, Captain Jekyl. I will own to you I owe you my\nthanks, for extricating me from that foolish affair at the Well--nothing\ncould have put me to more inconvenience than the necessity of following\nto extremity a frivolous quarrel at the present moment.\"\n\n\"You will come down among us, then?\" said Jekyl.\n\n\"I certainly shall not wish to appear to hide myself,\" answered Tyrrel;\n\"it is a circumstance might be turned against me--there is a party who\nwill avail himself of every advantage. I have but one path, Captain\nJekyl--that of truth and honour.\"\n\nCaptain Jekyl bowed, and took his leave. So soon as he was gone, Tyrrel\nlocked the door of the apartment, and drawing from his bosom a portrait,\ngazed on it with a mixture of sorrow and tenderness, until the tears\ndropped from his eye.\n\nIt was the picture of Clara Mowbray, such as he had known her in the\ndays of their youthful love, and taken by himself, whose early turn for\npainting had already developed itself. The features of the blooming girl\nmight be yet traced in the fine countenance of the more matured\noriginal. But what was now become of the glow which had shaded her\ncheek?--what of the arch, yet subdued pleasantry, which lurked in the\neye?--what of the joyous content, which composed every feature to the\nexpression of an Euphrosyne?--Alas! these were long fled!--Sorrow had\nlaid his hand upon her--the purple light of youth was quenched--the\nglance of innocent gaiety was exchanged for looks now moody with\nill-concealed care, now animated by a spirit of reckless and satirical\nobservation.\n\n\"What a wreck! what a wreck!\" exclaimed Tyrrel; \"and all of one wretch's\nmaking.--Can I put the last hand to the work, and be her murderer\noutright? I cannot--I cannot!--I will be strong in the resolve I have\nformed--I will sacrifice all--rank--station--fortune--and fame.\nRevenge!--Revenge itself, the last good left me--revenge itself I will\nsacrifice, to obtain for her such tranquillity as she may be yet capable\nto enjoy.\"\n\nIn this resolution he sat down, and wrote a letter to the commercial\nhouse with whom the documents of his birth, and other relative papers,\nwere deposited, requesting that the packet containing them should be\nforwarded to him through the post-office.\n\nTyrrel was neither unambitious, nor without those sentiments respecting\npersonal consideration, which are usually united with deep feeling and\nan ardent mind. It was with a trembling hand, and a watery eye, but with\na heart firmly resolved, that he sealed and dispatched the letter; a\nstep towards the resignation, in favour of his mortal enemy, of that\nrank and condition in life, which was his own by right of inheritance,\nbut had so long hung in doubt betwixt them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI.\n\nINTRUSION.\n\n     By my troth, I will go with thee to the lane's-end!--I am a kind of\n     burr--I shall stick.\n\n_Measure for Measure._\n\n\nIt was now far advanced in autumn. The dew lay thick on the long grass,\nwhere it was touched by the sun; but where the sward lay in shadow, it\nwas covered with hoar frost, and crisped under Jekyl's foot, as he\nreturned through the woods of St. Ronan's. The leaves of the ash-trees\ndetached themselves from the branches, and, without an air of wind, fell\nspontaneously on the path. The mists still lay lazily upon the heights,\nand the huge old tower of St. Ronan's was entirely shrouded with vapour,\nexcept where a sunbeam, struggling with the mist, penetrated into its\nwreath so far as to show a projecting turret upon one of the angles of\nthe old fortress, which, long a favourite haunt of the raven, was\npopularly called the Corbie's Tower. Beneath, the scene was open and\nlightsome, and the robin redbreast was chirping his best, to atone for\nthe absence of all other choristers. The fine foliage of autumn was seen\nin many a glade, running up the sides of each little ravine, russet-hued\nand golden-specked, and tinged frequently with the red hues of the\nmountain-ash; while here and there a huge old fir, the native growth of\nthe soil, flung his broad shadow over the rest of the trees, and seemed\nto exult in the permanence of his dusky livery over the more showy, but\ntransitory brilliance by which he was surrounded.\n\nSuch is the scene, which, so often described in prose and in poetry, yet\nseldom loses its effect upon the ear or upon the eye, and through which\nwe wander with a strain of mind congenial to the decline of the year.\nThere are few who do not feel the impression; and even Jekyl, though\nbred to far different pursuits than those most favourable to such\ncontemplation, relaxed his pace to admire the uncommon beauty of the\nlandscape.\n\nPerhaps, also, he was in no hurry to rejoin the Earl of Etherington,\ntowards whose service he felt himself more disinclined since his\ninterview with Tyrrel. It was clear that that nobleman had not fully\nreposed in his friend the confidence promised; he had not made him aware\nof the existence of those important documents of proof, on which the\nwhole fate of his negotiation appeared now to hinge, and in so far had\ndeceived him. Yet, when he pulled from his pocket, and re-read Lord\nEtherington's explanatory letter, Jekyl could not help being more\nsensible than he had been on the first perusal, how much the present\npossessor of that title felt alarmed at his brother's claims; and he had\nsome compassion for the natural feeling that must have rendered him shy\nof communicating at once the very worst view of his case, even to his\nmost confidential friend. Upon the whole, he remembered that Lord\nEtherington had been his benefactor to an unusual extent; that, in\nreturn, he had promised the young nobleman his active and devoted\nassistance, in extricating him from the difficulties with which he\nseemed at present surrounded; that, in quality of his confidant, he had\nbecome acquainted with the most secret transactions of his life; and\nthat it could only be some very strong cause indeed which could justify\nbreaking off from him at this moment. Yet he could not help wishing\neither that his own obligations had been less, his friend's cause\nbetter, or, at least, the friend himself more worthy of assistance.\n\n\"A beautiful morning, sir, for such a foggy, d----d climate as this,\"\nsaid a voice close by Jekyl's ear, which made him at once start out of\nhis contemplation. He turned half round, and beside him stood our honest\nfriend Touchwood, his throat muffled in his large Indian handkerchief,\nhuge gouty shoes thrust upon his feet, his bobwig well powdered, and the\ngold-headed cane in his hand, carried upright as a sergeant's halberd.\nOne glance of contemptuous survey entitled Jekyl, according to his\nmodish ideas, to rank the old gentleman as a regular-built quiz, and to\ntreat him as the young gentlemen of his Majesty's Guards think\nthemselves entitled to use every unfashionable variety of the human\nspecies. A slight inclination of a bow, and a very cold \"You have the\nadvantage of me, sir,\" dropped as it were unconsciously from his tongue,\nwere meant to repress the old gentleman's advances, and moderate his\nambition to be hail fellow well met with his betters. But Mr. Touchwood\nwas callous to the intended rebuke; he had lived too much at large upon\nthe world, and was far too confident of his own merits, to take a\nrepulse easily, or to permit his modesty to interfere with any purpose\nwhich he had formed.\n\n\"Advantage of you, sir?\" he replied; \"I have lived too long in the world\nnot to keep all the advantages I have, and get all I can--and I reckon\nit one that I have overtaken you, and shall have the pleasure of your\ncompany to the Well.\"\n\n\"I should but interrupt your worthier meditations, sir,\" said the other;\n\"besides, I am a modest young man, and think myself fit for no better\ncompany than my own--moreover, I walk slow--very slow.--Good morning to\nyou, Mr. A--A--I believe my treacherous memory has let slip your name,\nsir.\"\n\n\"My name!--Why your memory must have been like Pat Murtough's greyhound,\nthat let the hare go before he caught it. You never heard my name in\nyour life. Touchwood is my name. What d'ye think of it, now you know\nit?\"\n\n\"I am really no connoisseur in surnames,\" answered Jekyl: \"and it is\nquite the same to me whether you call yourself Touchwood or Touchstone.\nDon't let me keep you from walking on, sir. You will find breakfast far\nadvanced at the Well, sir, and your walk has probably given you an\nappetite.\"\n\n\"Which will serve me to luncheon-time, I promise you,\" said Touchwood;\n\"I always drink my coffee as soon as my feet are in my pabouches--it's\nthe way all over the East. Never trust my breakfast to their scalding\nmilk-and-water at the Well, I assure you; and for walking slow, I have\nhad a touch of the gout.\"\n\n\"Have you,\" said Jekyl; \"I am sorry for that; because, if you have no\nmind to breakfast, I have--and so, Mr. Touchstone, good-morrow to you.\"\n\nBut, although the young soldier went off at double quick time, his\npertinacious attendant kept close by his side, displaying an activity\nwhich seemed inconsistent with his make and his years, and talking away\nthe whole time, so as to show that his lungs were not in the least\ndegree incommoded by the unusual rapidity of motion.\n\n\"Nay, young gentleman, if you are for a good smart walk, I am for you,\nand the gout may be d--d. You are a lucky fellow to have youth on your\nside; but yet, so far as between the Aultoun and the Well, I think I\ncould walk you for your sum, barring running--all heel and toe--equal\nweight, and I would match Barclay himself for a mile.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, you are a gay old gentleman!\" said Jekyl, relaxing his\npace; \"and if we must be fellow-travellers, though I can see no great\noccasion for it, I must even shorten sail for you.\"\n\nSo saying, and as if another means of deliverance had occurred to him,\nhe slackened his pace, took out a morocco case of cigars, and, lighting\none with his _briquet_, said, while he walked on, and bestowed as much\nof its fragrance as he could upon the face of his intrusive companion,\n\"Vergeben sie, mein herr--ich bin erzogen in kaiserlicher dienst--muss\nrauchen ein kleine wenig.\"[II-6]\n\n\"Rauchen sie immer fort,\" said Touchwood, producing a huge meerschaum,\nwhich, suspended by a chain from his neck, lurked in the bosom of his\ncoat, \"habe auch mein pfeichen--Sehen sie den lieben topf!\"[II-7] and he\nbegan to return the smoke, if not the fire, of his companion, in full\nvolumes, and with interest.\n\n\"The devil take the twaddle,\" said Jekyl to himself, \"he is too old and\ntoo fat to be treated after the manner of Professor Jackson; and, on my\nlife, I cannot tell what to make of him.--He is a residenter too--I must\ntip him the cold shoulder, or he will be pestering me eternally.\"\n\nAccordingly, he walked on, sucking his cigar, and apparently in as\nabstracted a mood as Mr. Cargill himself, without paying the least\nattention to Touchwood, who, nevertheless, continued talking, as if he\nhad been addressing the most attentive listener in Scotland, whether it\nwere the favourite nephew of a cross, old, rich bachelor, or the\naid-de-camp of some old rusty firelock of a general, who tells stories\nof the American war.\n\n\"And so, sir, I can put up with any companion at a pinch, for I have\ntravelled in all sorts of ways, from a caravan down to a carrier's cart;\nbut the best society is the best every where; and I am happy I have\nfallen in with a gentleman who suits me so well as you.--That grave,\nsteady attention of yours reminds me of Elfi Bey--you might talk to him\nin English, or any thing he understood least of--you might have read\nAristotle to Elfi, and not a muscle would he stir--give him his pipe,\nand he would sit on his cushion with a listening air as if he took in\nevery word of what you said.\"\n\nCaptain Jekyl threw away the remnant of his cigar, with a little\nmovement of pettishness, and began to whistle an opera air.\n\n\"There again, now!--That is just so like the Marquis of Roccombole,\nanother dear friend of mine, that whistles all the time you talk to\nhim--He says he learned it in the Reign of Terror, when a man was glad\nto whistle to show his throat was whole. And, talking of great folk,\nwhat do you think of this affair between Lord Etherington and his\nbrother, or cousin, as some folk call him?\"\n\nJekyl absolutely started at the question; a degree of emotion, which,\nhad it been witnessed by any of his fashionable friends, would for ever\nhave ruined his pretensions to rank in the first order.\n\n\"What affair?\" he asked, so soon as he could command a certain degree of\ncomposure.\n\n\"Why, you know the news surely? Francis Tyrrel, whom all the company\nvoted a coward the other day, turns out as brave a fellow as any of us;\nfor, instead of having run away to avoid having his own throat cut by\nSir Bingo Binks, he was at the very moment engaged in a gallant attempt\nto murder his elder brother, or his more lawful brother, or his cousin,\nor some such near relation.\"\n\n\"I believe you are misinformed, sir,\" said Jekyl dryly, and then\nresumed, as deftly as he could, his proper character of a pococurante.\n\n\"I am told,\" continued Touchwood, \"one Jekyl acted as a second to them\nboth on the occasion--a proper fellow, sir--one of those fine gentlemen\nwhom we pay for polishing the pavement in Bond Street, and looking at a\nthick shoe and a pair of worsted stockings, as if the wearer were none\nof their paymasters. However, I believe the Commander-in-Chief is like\nto discard him when he hears what has happened.\"\n\n\"Sir!\" said Jekyl, fiercely--then, recollecting the folly of being angry\nwith an original of his companion's description, he proceeded more\ncoolly, \"You are misinformed--Captain Jekyl knew nothing of any such\nmatter as you refer to--you talk of a person you know nothing\nof--Captain Jekyl is----(Here he stopped a little, scandalized, perhaps,\nat the very idea of vindicating himself to such a personage from such a\ncharge.)\n\n\"Ay, ay,\" said the traveller, filling up the chasm in his own way, \"he\nis not worth our talking of, certainly--but I believe he knew as much of\nthe matter as either you or I do, for all that.\"\n\n\"Sir, this is either a very great mistake, or wilful impertinence,\"\nanswered the officer. \"However absurd or intrusive you may be, I cannot\nallow you, either in ignorance or incivility, to use the name of Captain\nJekyl with disrespect.--I am Captain Jekyl, sir.\"\n\n\"Very like, very like,\" said Touchwood, with the most provoking\nindifference; \"I guessed as much before.\"\n\n\"Then, sir, you may guess what is likely to follow, when a gentleman\nhears himself unwarrantably and unjustly slandered,\" replied Captain\nJekyl, surprised and provoked that his annunciation of name and rank\nseemed to be treated so lightly. \"I advise you, sir, not to proceed too\nfar upon the immunities of your age and insignificance.\"\n\n\"I never presume farther than I have good reason to think necessary,\nCaptain Jekyl,\" answered Touchwood, with great composure. \"I am too old,\nas you say, for any such idiotical business as a duel, which no nation I\nknow of practises but our silly fools of Europe--and then, as for your\nswitch, which you are grasping with so much dignity, that is totally out\nof the question. Look you, young gentleman; four-fifths of my life have\nbeen spent among men who do not set a man's life at the value of a\nbutton on his collar--every person learns, in such cases, to protect\nhimself as he can; and whoever strikes me must stand to the\nconsequences. I have always a brace of bull-dogs about me, which put age\nand youth on a level. So suppose me horsewhipped, and pray, at the same\ntime, suppose yourself shot through the body. The same exertion of\nimagination will serve for both purposes.\"\n\nSo saying, he exhibited a very handsome, highly finished, and\nrichly-mounted pair of pistols.\n\n\"Catch me without my tools,\" said he, significantly buttoning his coat\nover the arms, which were concealed in a side-pocket, ingeniously\ncontrived for that purpose. \"I see you do not know what to make of me,\"\nhe continued, in a familiar and confidential tone; \"but, to tell you the\ntruth, everybody that has meddled in this St. Ronan's business is a\nlittle off the hooks--something of a _t\u00c3\u00aate exalt\u00c3\u00a9e_, in plain words, a\nlittle crazy, or so; and I do not affect to be much wiser than other\npeople.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Jekyl, \"your manners and discourse are so unprecedented,\nthat I must ask your meaning plainly and decidedly--Do you mean to\ninsult me or no?\"\n\n\"No insult at all, young gentleman--all fair meaning, and above board--I\nonly wished to let you know what the world may say, that is all.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Jekyl, hastily, \"the world may tell what lies it pleases;\nbut I was not present at the rencontre between Etherington and Mr.\nTyrrel--I was some hundred miles off.\"\n\n\"There now,\" said Touchwood, \"there _was_ a rencontre between them--the\nvery thing I wanted to know.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Jekyl, aware too late that, in his haste to vindicate\nhimself, he had committed his friend, \"I desire you will found nothing\non an expression hastily used to vindicate myself from a false\naspersion--I only meant to say, if there was an affair such as you talk\nof, I knew nothing of it.\"\n\n\"Never mind--never mind--I shall make no bad use of what I have\nlearned,\" said Touchwood. \"Were you to eat your words with the best\nfish-sauce, (and that is Burgess's,) I have got all the information from\nthem I wanted.\"\n\n\"You are strangely pertinacious, sir,\" replied Jekyl.\n\n\"O, a rock, a piece of flint for that--What I have learned, I have\nlearned, but I will make no bad use of it.--Hark ye, Captain, I have no\nmalice against your friend--perhaps the contrary--but he is in a bad\ncourse, sir--has kept a false reckoning, for as deep as he thinks\nhimself; and I tell you so, because I hold you (your finery out of the\nquestion) to be, as Hamlet says, indifferent honest; but, if you were\nnot, why necessity is necessity; and a man will take a Bedouin for his\nguide in the desert, whom he would not trust with an aspar in the\ncultivated field; so I think of reposing some confidence in you--have\nnot made up my mind yet, though.\"\n\n\"On my word, sir, I am greatly flattered both by your intentions and\nyour hesitation,\" said Captain Jekyl. \"You were pleased to say just now,\nthat every one concerned with these matters was something particular.\"\n\n\"Ay, ay--something crazy--a little mad, or so. That was what I said, and\nI can prove it.\"\n\n\"I should be glad to hear the proof,\" said Jekyl--\"I hope you do not\nexcept yourself?\"\n\n\"Oh! by no means,\" answered Touchwood; \"I am one of the maddest old boys\never slept out of straw, or went loose. But you can put fishing\nquestions in your turn, Captain, I see that--you would fain know how\nmuch, or how little, I am in all these secrets. Well, that is as\nhereafter may be. In the meantime, here are my proofs.--Old Scrogie\nMowbray was mad, to like the sound of Mowbray better than that of\nScrogie; young Scrogie was mad, not to like it as well. The old Earl of\nEtherington was not sane when he married a French wife in secret, and\ndevilish mad indeed when he married an English one in public. Then for\nthe good folk here, Mowbray of St. Ronan's is cracked, when he wishes to\ngive his sister to he knows not precisely whom: She is a fool not to\ntake him, because she _does_ know who he is, and what has been between\nthem; and your friend is maddest of all, who seeks her under so heavy a\npenalty:--and you and I, Captain, go mad gratis, for company's sake,\nwhen we mix ourselves with such a mess of folly and frenzy.\"\n\n\"Really, sir, all that you have said is an absolute riddle to me,\"\nreplied the embarrassed Jekyl.\n\n\"Riddles may be read,\" said Touchwood, nodding; \"if you have any desire\nto read mine, pray, take notice, that this being our first interview, I\nhave exerted myself _faire les frais du conversation_, as Jack Frenchman\nsays; if you want another, you may come to Mrs. Dods's at the Cleikum\nInn, any day before Saturday, at four precisely, when you will find none\nof your half-starved, long-limbed bundles of bones, which you call\npoultry at the table-d'h\u00c3\u00b4te, but a right Chitty-gong fowl!--I got Mrs.\nDods the breed from old Ben Vandewash, the Dutch broker--stewed to a\nminute, with rice and mushrooms.--If you can eat without a silver fork,\nand your appetite serves you, you shall be welcome--that's all.--So,\ngood morning to you, good master lieutenant, for a captain of the Guards\nis but a lieutenant after all.\"\n\nSo saying, and ere Jekyl could make any answer, the old gentleman turned\nshort off into a path which led to the healing fountain, branching away\nfrom that which conducted to the Hotel.\n\nUncertain with whom he had been holding a conversation so strange, Jekyl\nremained looking after him, until his attention was roused by a little\nboy, who crept out from an adjoining thicket, with a switch in his hand,\nwhich he had been just cutting,--probably against regulations to the\ncontrary effect made and provided, for he held himself ready to take\ncover in the copse again, in case any one were in sight who might be\ninterested in chastising his delinquency. Captain Jekyl easily\nrecognised in him one of that hopeful class of imps, who pick up a\nprecarious livelihood about places of public resort, by going errands,\nbrushing shoes, doing the groom's and coachman's work in the stables,\ndriving donkeys, opening gates, and so forth, for about one-tenth part\nof their time, spending the rest in gambling, sleeping in the sun, and\notherwise qualifying themselves to exercise the profession of thieves\nand pickpockets, either separately, or in conjunction with those of\nwaiters, grooms, and postilions. The little outcast had an indifferent\npair of pantaloons, and about half a jacket, for, like Pentapolin with\nthe naked arm, he went on action with his right shoulder bare; a third\npart of what had once been a hat covered his hair, bleached white with\nthe sun, and his face, as brown as a berry, was illuminated by a pair of\neyes, which, for spying out either peril or profit, might have rivalled\nthose of the hawk.--In a word, it was the original Puck of the Shaws\ndramaticals.\n\n\"Come hither, ye unhanged whelp,\" said Jekyl, \"and tell me if you know\nthe old gentleman that passed down the walk just now--yonder he is,\nstill in sight.\"\n\n\"It is the Naboab,\" said the boy; \"I could swear to his back among all\nthe backs at the Waal, your honour.\"\n\n\"What do you call a Nabob, you varlet?\"\n\n\"A Naboab--a Naboab?\" answered the scout; \"odd, I believe it is ane\ncomes frae foreign parts, with mair siller than his pouches can haud,\nand spills it a' through the country--they are as yellow as orangers,\nand maun hae a' thing their ain gate.\"\n\n\"And what is this Naboab's name, as you call him?\" demanded Jekyl.\n\n\"His name is Touchwood,\" said his informer; \"ye may see him at the Waal\nevery morning.\"\n\n\"I have not seen him at the ordinary.\"\n\n\"Na, na,\" answered the boy; \"he is a queer auld cull, he disna frequent\nwi' other folk, but lives upby at the Cleikum.--He gave me half-a-crown\nyince, and forbade me to play it awa' at pitch and toss.\"\n\n\"And you disobeyed him, of course?\"\n\n\"Na, I didna dis-obeyed him--I played it awa' at\nneevie-neevie-nick-nack.\"\n\n\"Well, there is sixpence for thee; lose it to the devil in any way thou\nthink'st proper.\"\n\nSo saying he gave the little galopin his donative, and a slight rap on\nthe pate at the same time, which sent him scouring from his presence. He\nhimself hastened to Lord Etherington's apartments, and, as luck would\nhave it, found the Earl alone.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[II-6] Forgive me, sir, I was bred in the Imperial service, and must smoke\na little.\n\n[II-7] Smoke as much as you please; I have got my pipe, too.--See what a\nbeautiful head!\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII.\n\nDISCUSSION.\n\n    I will converse with iron-witted fools\n    And unrespective boys--none are for me\n    That look into me with suspicious eyes.\n\n_Richard III._\n\n\n\"How now, Jekyl!\" said Lord Etherington, eagerly; \"what news from the\nenemy?--Have you seen him?\"\n\n\"I have,\" replied Jekyl.\n\n\"And in what humour did you find him?--in none that was very favourable,\nI dare say, for you have a baffled and perplexed look, that confesses a\nlosing game--I have often warned you how your hang-dog look betrays you\nat brag--And then, when you would fain brush up your courage, and put a\ngood face on a bad game, your bold looks always remind me of a standard\nhoisted only half-mast high, and betraying melancholy and dejection,\ninstead of triumph and defiance.\"\n\n\"I am only holding the cards for your lordship at present,\" answered\nJekyl; \"and I wish to Heaven there may be no one looking over the hand.\"\n\n\"How do you mean by that?\"\n\n\"Why, I was beset, on returning through the wood, by an old bore, a\nNabob, as they call him, and Touchwood by name.\"\n\n\"I have seen such a quiz about,\" said Lord Etherington--\"What of him?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" answered Jekyl, \"except that he seemed to know much more of\nyour affairs than you would wish or are aware of. He smoked the truth of\nthe rencontre betwixt Tyrrel and you, and what is worse--I must needs\nconfess the truth--he contrived to wring out of me a sort of\nconfirmation of his suspicions.\"\n\n\"'Slife! wert thou mad?\" said Lord Etherington, turning pale; \"His is\nthe very tongue to send the story through the whole country--Hal, you\nhave undone me.\"\n\n\"I hope not,\" said Jekyl; \"I trust in Heaven I have not!--His knowledge\nis quite general--only that there was some scuffle between you--Do not\nlook so dismayed about it, or I will e'en go back and cut his throat, to\nsecure his secrecy.\"\n\n\"Cursed indiscretion!\" answered the Earl--\"how could you let him fix on\nyou at all?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell,\" said Jekyl--\"he has powers of boring beyond ten of the\ndullest of all possible doctors--stuck like a limpet to a rock--a\nperfect double of the Old Man of the Sea, who I take to have been the\ngreatest bore on record.\"\n\n\"Could you not have turned him on his back like a turtle, and left him\nthere?\" said Lord Etherington.\n\n\"And had an ounce of lead in my body for my pains? No--no--we have\nalready had footpad work enough--I promise you the old buck was armed,\nas if he meant to bing folks on the low toby.\"[II-8]\n\n\"Well--well--But Martigny, or Tyrrel, as you call him--what says he?\"\n\n\"Why, Tyrrel, or Martigny, as your lordship calls him,\" answered Jekyl,\n\"will by no means listen to your lordship's proposition. He will not\nconsent that Miss Mowbray's happiness shall be placed in your lordship's\nkeeping; nay, it did not meet his approbation a bit the more, when I\nhinted at the acknowledgment of the marriage, or the repetition of the\nceremony, attended by an immediate separation, which I thought I might\nventure to propose.\"\n\n\"And on what grounds does he refuse so reasonable an accommodation?\"\nsaid Lord Etherington--\"Does he still seek to marry the girl himself?\"\n\n\"I believe he thinks the circumstances of the case render that\nimpossible,\" replied his confidant.\n\n\"What? then he would play the dog in the manger--neither eat nor let\neat?--He shall find himself mistaken. She has used me like a dog, Jekyl,\nsince I saw you; and, by Jove! I will have her, that I may break her\npride, and cut him to the liver with the agony of seeing it.\"\n\n\"Nay, but hold--hold!\" said Jekyl; \"perhaps I have something to say on\nhis part, that may be a better compromise than all you could have by\nteasing him. He is willing to purchase what he calls Miss Mowbray's\ntranquillity, at the expense of his resignation of his claims to your\nfather's honours and estate; and he surprised me very much, my lord, by\nshowing me this list of documents, which, I am afraid, makes his success\nmore than probable, if there really are such proofs in existence.\" Lord\nEtherington took the paper, and seemed to read with much attention,\nwhile Jekyl proceeded,--\"He has written to procure these evidences from\nthe person with whom they are deposited.\"\n\n\"We shall see what like they are when they arrive,\" said Lord\nEtherington.--\"They come by post, I suppose?\"\n\n\"Yes; and may be immediately expected,\" answered Jekyl.\n\n\"Well--he is my brother on one side of the house, at least,\" said Lord\nEtherington; \"and I should not much like to have him lagged for forgery,\nwhich I suppose will be the end of his bolstering up an unsubstantial\nplea by fabricated documents--I should like to see these same papers he\ntalks of.\"\n\n\"But, my lord,\" replied Jekyl, \"Tyrrel's allegation is, that you _have_\nseen them; and that copies, at least, were made out for you, and are in\nyour possession--such is his averment.\"\n\n\"He lies,\" answered Lord Etherington, \"so far as he pretends I know of\nsuch papers. I consider the whole story as froth--foam--fudge, or\nwhatever is most unsubstantial. It will prove such when the papers\nappear, if indeed they ever will appear. The whole is a bully from\nbeginning to end; and I wonder at thee, Jekyl, for being so thirsty\nafter syllabub, that you can swallow such whipt cream as that stuff\namounts to. No, no--I know my advantage, and shall use it so as to make\nall their hearts bleed. As for these papers, I recollect now that my\nagent talked of copies of some manuscripts having been sent him, but the\noriginals were not then forthcoming; and I'll bet the long odds that\nthey never are--mere fabrications--if I thought otherwise, would I not\ntell you?\"\n\n\"Certainly, I hope you would, my lord,\" said Jekyl; \"for I see no chance\nof my being useful to you, unless I have the honour to enjoy your\nconfidence.\"\n\n\"You do--you do, my friend,\" said Etherington, shaking him by the hand;\n\"and since I must consider your present negotiation as failed, I must\ndevise some other mode of settling with this mad and troublesome\nfellow.\"\n\n\"No violence, my lord,\" said Jekyl, once more, and with much emphasis.\n\n\"None--none--none, by Heaven!--Why, thou suspicious wretch, must I\nswear, to quell your scruples?--On the contrary, it shall not be my\nfault, if we are not on decent terms.\"\n\n\"It would be infinitely to the advantage of both your characters if you\ncould bring that to pass,\" answered Jekyl; \"and if you are serious in\nwishing it, I will endeavour to prepare Tyrrel. He comes to the Well or\nto the ordinary to-day, and it would be highly ridiculous to make a\nscene.\"\n\n\"True, true; find him out, my dear Jekyl, and persuade him how foolish\nit will be to bring our family quarrels out before strangers, and for\ntheir amusement. They shall see the two bears can meet without\nbiting.--Go--go--I will follow you instantly--go, and remember you have\nmy full and exclusive confidence.--Go, half-bred, startling fool!\" he\ncontinued, the instant Jekyl had left the room, \"with just spirits\nenough to ensure your own ruin, by hurrying you into what you are not up\nto.--But he has character in the world--is brave--and one of those whose\ncountenance gives a fair face to a doubtful business. He is my creature,\ntoo--I have bought and paid for him, and it would be idle extravagance\nnot to make use of him--But as to confidence--no confidence, honest Hal,\nbeyond that which cannot be avoided. If I wanted a confidant, here comes\na better than thou by half--Solmes has no scruples--he will always give\nme money's worth of zeal and secrecy _for_ money.\"\n\nHis lordship's valet at this moment entered the apartment, a grave,\ncivil-looking man, past the middle age, with a sallow complexion, a dark\nthoughtful eye, slow, and sparing of speech, and sedulously attentive to\nall the duties of his situation.\n\n\"Solmes,\"--said Lord Etherington, and then stopped short.\n\n\"My lord\"--There was a pause; and when Lord Etherington had again said,\n\"Solmes!\" and his valet had answered, \"Your lordship,\" there was a\nsecond pause; until the Earl, as if recollecting himself, \"Oh! I\nremember what I wished to say--it was about the course of post here. It\nis not very regular, I believe?\"\n\n\"Regular enough, my lord, so far as concerns this place--the people in\nthe Aultoun do not get their letters in course.\"\n\n\"And why not, Solmes?\" said his lordship.\n\n\"The old woman who keeps the little inn there, my lord, is on bad terms\nwith the post-mistress--the one will not send for the letters, and the\nother will not dispatch them to the village; so, betwixt them, they are\nsometimes lost or mislaid, or returned to the General Post-office.\"\n\n\"I wish that may not be the case of a packet which I expect in a few\ndays--it should have been here already, or, perhaps, it may arrive in\nthe beginning of the week--it is from that formal ass, Trueman the\nQuaker, who addresses me by my Christian and family name, Francis\nTyrrel. He is like enough to mistake the inn, too, and I should be sorry\nit fell into Monsieur Martigny's hands--I suppose you know he is in that\nneighbourhood?--Look after its safety, Solmes--quietly, you understand;\nbecause people might put odd constructions, as if I were wanting a\nletter which was not my own.\"\n\n\"I understand perfectly, my lord,\" said Solmes, without exhibiting the\nslightest change in his sallow countenance, though entirely\ncomprehending the nature of the service required.\n\n\"And here is a note will pay for postage,\" said the Earl, putting into\nhis valet's hand a bank-bill of considerable value; \"and you may keep\nthe balance for occasional expenses.\"\n\nThis was also fully understood; and Solmes, too politic and cautious\neven to look intelligence, or acknowledge gratitude, made only a bow of\nacquiescence, put the note into his pocketbook, and assured his lordship\nthat his commands should be punctually attended to.\n\n\"There goes the agent for my money, and for my purpose,\" said Lord\nEtherington, exultingly; \"no extorting of confidence, no demanding of\nexplanations, no tearing off the veil with which a delicate manoeuvre is\n_gaz\u00c3\u00a9_--all excuses are received as _argent comptant_, provided only,\nthat the best excuse of all, the _argent comptant_ itself, come to\nrecommend them.--Yet I will trust no one--I will out, like a skilful\ngeneral, and reconnoitre in person.\"\n\nWith this resolution, Lord Etherington put on his surtout and cap, and\nsallying from his apartments, took the way to the bookseller's shop,\nwhich also served as post-office and circulating library; and being in\nthe very centre of the parade, (for so is termed the broad terrace walk\nwhich leads from the inn to the Well,) it formed a convenient\nlounging-place for newsmongers and idlers of every description.\n\nThe Earl's appearance created, as usual, a sensation upon the public\npromenade; but whether it was the suggestion of his own alarmed\nconscience, or that there was some real cause for the remark, he could\nnot help thinking his reception was of a more doubtful character than\nusual. His fine figure and easy manners produced their usual effect, and\nall whom he spoke to received his attention as an honour; but none\noffered, as usual, to unite themselves to him, or to induce him to join\ntheir party. He seemed to be looked on rather as an object of\nobservation and attention, than as making one of the company; and to\nescape from a distant gaze, which became rather embarrassing, he turned\ninto the little emporium of news and literature.\n\nHe entered unobserved, just as Lady Penelope had finished reading some\nverses, and was commenting upon them with all the alacrity of a _femme\nsavante_, in possession of something which no one is to hear repeated\noftener than once.\n\n\"Copy--no indeed!\" these were the snatches which reached Lord\nEtherington's ear, from the group of which her ladyship formed the\ncentre--\"honour bright--I must not betray poor Chatterly--besides, his\nlordship is my friend, and a person of rank, you know--so one would\nnot--You have not got the book, Mr. Pott?--you have not got\nStatius?--you never have any thing one longs to see.\"\n\n\"Very sorry, my lady--quite out of copies at present--I expect some in\nmy next monthly parcel.\"\n\n\"Good lack, Mr. Pott, that is your never-failing answer,\" said Lady\nPenelope; \"I believe if I were to ask you for the last new edition of\nthe Alkoran, you would tell me it was coming down in your next monthly\nparcel.\"\n\n\"Can't say, my lady, really,\" answered Mr. Pott; \"have not seen the work\nadvertised yet; but I have no doubt, if it is likely to take, there will\nbe copies in my next monthly parcel.\"\n\n\"Mr. Pott's supplies are always in the _paullo post futurum_ tense,\"\nsaid Mr. Chatterly, who was just entering the shop.\n\n\"Ah! Mr. Chatterly, are you there?\" said Lady Penelope; \"I lay my death\nat your door--I cannot find this Thebaid, where Polynices and his\nbrother\"----\n\n\"Hush, my lady!--hush, for Heaven's sake!\" said the poetical divine, and\nlooked towards Lord Etherington. Lady Penelope took the hint, and was\nsilent; but she had said enough to call up the traveller Touchwood, who\nraised his head from the newspaper which he was studying, and, without\naddressing his discourse to any one in particular, ejaculated, as if in\nscorn of Lady Penelope's geography--\n\n\"Polynices?--Polly Peachum.--There is no such place in the Thebais--the\nThebais is in Egypt--the mummies come from the Thebais--I have been in\nthe catacombs--caves very curious indeed--we were lapidated by the\nnatives--pebbled to some purpose, I give you my word. My janizary\nthrashed a whole village by way of retaliation.\"\n\nWhile he was thus proceeding, Lord Etherington, as if in a listless\nmood, was looking at the letters which stood ranged on the\nchimney-piece, and carrying on a languid dialogue with Mrs. Pott, whose\nperson and manners were not ill adapted to her situation, for she was\ngood-looking, and vastly fine and affected.\n\n\"Number of letters here which don't seem to find owners, Mrs. Pott?\"\n\n\"Great number, indeed, my lord--it is a great vexation, for we are\nobliged to return them to the post-office, and the postage is charged\nagainst us if they are lost; and how can one keep sight of them all?\"\n\n\"Any love-letters among them, Mrs. Pott?\" said his lordship, lowering\nhis tone.\n\n\"Oh, fie! my lord, how should I know?\" answered Mrs. Pott, dropping her\nvoice to the same cadence.\n\n\"Oh! every one can tell a love-letter--that has ever received one, that\nis--one knows them without opening--they are always folded hurriedly and\nsealed carefully--and the direction manifests a kind of tremulous\nagitation, that marks the state of the writer's nerves--that\nnow,\"--pointing with his switch to a letter upon the chimney-piece,\n\"that _must_ be a love-letter.\"\n\n\"He, he, he!\" giggled Mrs. Pott, \"I beg pardon for laughing, my\nlord--but--he, he, he!--that is a letter from one Bindloose, the banker\nbody, to the old woman Luckie Dods, as they call her, at the\nchange-house in the Aultoun.\"\n\n\"Depend upon it then, Mrs. Pott, that your neighbour, Mrs. Dods, has got\na lover in Mr. Bindloose--unless the banker has been shaking hands with\nthe palsy. Why do you not forward her letter?--you are very cruel to\nkeep it in durance here.\"\n\n\"Me forward!\" answered Mrs. Pott; \"the cappernoity, old, girning\nalewife, may wait long enough or I forward it--She'll not loose the\nletters that come to her by the King's post, and she must go on troking\nwi' the old carrier, as if there was no post-house in the neighbourhood.\nBut the solicitor will be about wi' her one of these days.\"\n\n\"Oh! you are too cruel--you really should send the love-letter;\nconsider, the older she is, the poor soul has the less time to lose.\"\n\nBut this was a topic on which Mrs. Pott understood no jesting. She was\nwell aware of our matron's inveteracy against her and her establishment,\nand she resented it as a placeman resents the efforts of a radical. She\nanswered something sulkily, \"That they that loosed letters should have\nletters; and neither Luckie Dods, nor any of her lodgers, should ever\nsee the scrape of a pen from the St. Ronan's office, that they did not\ncall for and pay for.\"\n\nIt is probable that this declaration contained the essence of the\ninformation which Lord Etherington had designed to extract by his\nmomentary flirtation with Mrs. Pott; for when, retreating as it were\nfrom this sore subject, she asked him, in a pretty mincing tone, to try\nhis skill in pointing out another love-letter, he only answered\ncarelessly, \"that in order to do that he must write her one;\" and\nleaving his confidential station by her little throne, he lounged\nthrough the narrow shop, bowed slightly to Lady Penelope as he passed,\nand issued forth upon the parade, where he saw a spectacle which might\nwell have appalled a man of less self-possession than himself.\n\nJust as he left the shop, little Miss Digges entered almost breathless,\nwith the emotion of impatience and of curiosity. \"Oh la! my lady, what\ndo you stay here for?--Mr. Tyrrel has just entered the other end of the\nparade this moment, and Lord Etherington is walking that way--they must\nmeet each other.--O lord! come, come away, and see them meet!--I wonder\nif they'll speak--I hope they won't fight--Oh la! do come, my lady!\"\n\n\"I must go with you, I find,\" said Lady Penelope; \"it is the strangest\nthing, my love, that curiosity of yours about other folk's matters--I\nwonder what your mamma will say to it.\"\n\n\"Oh! never mind mamma--nobody minds her--papa, nor nobody--Do come,\ndearest Lady Pen, or I will run away by myself.--Mr. Chatterly, do make\nher come!\"\n\n\"I must come, it seems,\" said Lady Penelope, \"or I shall have a pretty\naccount of you.\"\n\nBut, notwithstanding this rebuke, and forgetting, at the same time, that\npeople of quality ought never to seem in a hurry, Lady Penelope, with\nsuch of her satellites as she could hastily collect around her, tripped\nalong the parade with unusual haste, in sympathy, doubtless, with Miss\nDigges's curiosity, as her ladyship declared she had none of her own.\n\nOur friend, the traveller, had also caught up Miss Digges's information;\nand, breaking off abruptly an account of the Great Pyramid, which had\nbeen naturally introduced by the mention of the Thebais, and echoing the\nfair alarmist's words, \"hope they won't fight,\" he rushed upon the\nparade, and bustled along as hard as his sturdy supporters could carry\nhim. If the gravity of the traveller, and the delicacy of Lady Penelope,\nwere surprised into unwonted haste from their eagerness to witness the\nmeeting of Tyrrel and Lord Etherington, it may be well supposed that\nthe decorum of the rest of the company was a slender restraint on their\ncuriosity, and that they hurried to be present at the expected scene,\nwith the alacrity of gentlemen of the fancy hastening to a set-to.\n\nIn truth, though the meeting afforded little sport to those who expected\ndire conclusions, it was, nevertheless, sufficiently interesting to\nthose spectators who are accustomed to read the language of suppressed\npassion betraying itself at the moment when the parties are most\ndesirous to conceal it.\n\nTyrrel had been followed by several loiterers so soon as he entered the\npublic walk; and their number was now so much reinforced, that he saw\nhimself with pain and displeasure the centre of a sort of crowd who\nwatched his motions. Sir Bingo and Captain MacTurk were the first to\nbustle through it, and to address him with as much politeness as they\ncould command.\n\n\"Servant, sir,\" mumbled Sir Bingo, extending the right hand of\nfellowship and reconciliation, ungloved. \"Servant--sorry that anything\nshould have happened between us--very sorry, on my word.\"\n\n\"No more need be said, sir,\" replied Tyrrel; \"the whole is forgotten.\"\n\n\"Very handsome, indeed--quite the civil thing--hope to meet you often,\nsir.\"--And here the knight was silent.\n\nMeanwhile, the more verbose Captain proceeded, \"Och, py Cot, and it was\nan awfu' mistake, and I could draw the penknife across my finger for\nhaving written the word.--By my sowl, and I scratched it till I\nscratched a hole in the paper.--Och! that I should live to do an uncivil\nthing by a gentleman that had got himself hit in an honourable affair!\nBut you should have written, my dear; for how the devil could we guess\nthat you were so well provided in quarrels, that you had to settle two\nin one day!\"\n\n\"I was hurt in an unexpected--an accidental manner, Captain MacTurk. I\ndid not write, because there was something, in my circumstances at the\nmoment which required secrecy; but I was resolved, the instant I\nrecovered, to put myself to rights in your good opinion.\"\n\n\"Och! and you have done that,\" said the Captain, nodding sagaciously;\n\"for Captain Jekyl, who is a fine child, has put us all up to your\nhonourable conduct. They are pretty boys, these guardsmen, though they\nmay play a little fine sometimes, and think more of themselves than\nperadventure they need for to do, in comparison with us of the\nline.--But he let us know all about it--and, though he said not a word\nof a certain fine lord, with his footpad, and his hurt, and what not,\nyet we all knew how to lay that and that together.--And if the law would\nnot right you, and there were bad words between you, why should not two\ngentlemen right themselves? And as to your being kinsmen, why should not\nkinsmen behave to each other like men of honour? Only, some say you are\nfather's sons, and that _is_ something too near.--I had once thoughts of\ncalling out my uncle Dougal myself, for there is no saying where the\nline should be drawn; but I thought, on the whole, there should be no\nfighting, as there is no marriage, within the forbidden degrees. As for\nfirst cousins--Wheugh!--that's all fair--fire away, Flanigan!--But here\nis my lord, just upon us, like a stag of the first head, and the whole\nherd behind him.\"\n\nTyrrel stepped forward a little before his officious companions, his\ncomplexion rapidly changing into various shades, like that of one who\nforces himself to approach and touch some animal or reptile for which he\nentertains that deep disgust and abhorrence which was anciently ascribed\nto constitutional antipathy. This appearance of constraint put upon\nhimself, with the changes which it produced on his face, was calculated\nto prejudice him somewhat in the opinion of the spectators, when\ncompared with the steady, stately, yet, at the same time, easy demeanour\nof the Earl of Etherington, who was equal to any man in England in the\ndifficult art of putting a good countenance on a bad cause. He met\nTyrrel with an air as unembarrassed, as it was cold; and, while he paid\nthe courtesy of a formal and distant salutation, he said aloud, \"I\npresume, Mr. Tyrrel de Martigny, that, since you have not thought fit to\navoid this awkward meeting, you are disposed to remember our family\nconnexion so far as to avoid making sport for the good company?\"\n\n\"You have nothing to apprehend from my passion, Mr. Bulmer,\" replied\nTyrrel, \"if you can assure yourself against the consequences of your\nown.\"\n\n\"I am glad of that,\" said the Earl, with the same composure, but sinking\nhis voice so as only to be heard by Tyrrel; \"and as we may not again in\na hurry hold any communication together, I take the freedom to remind\nyou, that I sent you a proposal of accommodation by my friend, Mr.\nJekyl.\"\n\n\"It was inadmissible,\" said Tyrrel--\"altogether inadmissible--both from\nreasons which you may guess, and others which it is needless to\ndetail.--I sent you a proposition, think of it well.\"\n\n\"I will,\" replied Lord Etherington, \"when I shall see it supported by\nthose alleged proofs, which I do not believe ever had existence.\"\n\n\"Your conscience holds another language from your tongue,\" said Tyrrel;\n\"but I disclaim reproaches, and decline altercation. I will let Captain\nJekyl know when I have received the papers, which, you say, are\nessential to your forming an opinion on my proposal.--In the meanwhile,\ndo not think to deceive me. I am here for the very purpose of watching\nand defeating your machinations; and, while I live, be assured they\nshall never succeed.--And now, sir--or my lord--for the titles are in\nyour choice--fare you well.\"\n\n\"Hold a little,\" said Lord Etherington. \"Since we are condemned to shock\neach other's eyes, it is fit the good company should know what they are\nto think of us. You are a philosopher, and do not value the opinion of\nthe public--a poor worldling like me is desirous to stand fair with\nit.--Gentlemen,\" he continued, raising his voice, \"Mr. Winterblossom,\nCaptain MacTurk, Mr.--what is his name, Jekyl?--Ay, Micklehen--You have,\nI believe, all some notion, that this gentleman, my near relation, and\nI, have some undecided claims on each other, which prevent our living\nupon good terms. We do not mean, however, to disturb you with our family\nquarrels; and, for my own part, while this gentleman, Mr. Tyrrel, or\nwhatever he may please to call himself, remains a member of this\ncompany, my behaviour to him will be the same as to any stranger who may\nhave that advantage.--Good morrow to you, sir--Good morning,\ngentlemen--we all meet at dinner, as usual.--Come, Jekyl.\"\n\nSo saying, he took Jekyl by the arm, and, gently extricating himself\nfrom the sort of crowd, walked off, leaving most of the company\nprepossessed in his favour, by the ease and apparent reasonableness of\nhis demeanour. Sounds of depreciation, forming themselves indistinctly\ninto something like the words, \"my eye, and Betty Martin,\" did issue\nfrom the neckcloth of Sir Bingo, but they were not much attended to; for\nit had not escaped the observation of the quicksighted gentry at the\nWell, that the Baronet's feelings towards the noble Earl were in the\ninverse ratio of those displayed by Lady Binks, and that, though ashamed\nto testify, or perhaps incapable of feeling, any anxious degree of\njealousy, his temper had been for some time considerably upon the fret;\na circumstance concerning which his fair moiety did not think it\nnecessary to give herself any concern.\n\nMeanwhile, the Earl of Etherington walked onward with his confidant, in\nthe full triumph of successful genius.\n\n\"You see,\" he said, \"Jekyl, that I can turn a corner with any man in\nEngland. It was a proper blunder of yours, that you must extricate the\nfellow from the mist which accident had flung around him--you might as\nwell have published the story of our rencontre at once, for every one\ncan guess it, by laying time, place, and circumstance together; but\nnever trouble your brains for a justification. You marked how I assumed\nmy natural superiority over him--towered up in the full pride of\nlegitimacy--silenced him even where the good company most do congregate.\nThis will go to Mowbray through his agent, and will put him still madder\non my alliance. I know he looks jealously on my flirtation with a\ncertain lady--the dasher yonder--nothing makes a man sensible of the\nvalue of an opportunity, but the chance of losing it.\"\n\n\"I wish to Heaven you would give up thoughts of Miss Mowbray!\" said\nJekyl; \"and take Tyrrel's offer, if he has the means of making it good.\"\n\n\"Ay, if--if. But I am quite sure he has no such rights as he pretends\nto, and that his papers are all a deception.--Why do you put your eye\nupon me as fixed as if you were searching out some wonderful secret?\"\n\n\"I wish I knew what to think of your real _bona fide_ belief respecting\nthese documents,\" said Jekyl, not a little puzzled by the steady and\nunembarrassed air of his friend.\n\n\"Why, thou most suspicious of coxcombs,\" said Etherington, \"what the\ndevil would you have me say to you?--Can I, as the lawyers say, prove a\nnegative? or, is it not very possible, that such things may exist,\nthough I have never seen or heard of them? All I can say is, that of all\nmen I am the most interested to deny the existence of such documents;\nand, therefore, certainly will not admit of it, unless I am compelled to\ndo so by their being produced; nor then either, unless I am at the same\ntime well assured of their authenticity.\"\n\n\"I cannot blame you for your being hard of faith, my lord,\" said Jekyl;\n\"but still I think if you can cut out with your earldom, and your noble\nhereditary estate, I would, in your case, pitch Nettlewood to the\ndevil.\"\n\n\"Yes, as you pitched your own patrimony, Jekyl; but you took care to\nhave the spending of it first.--What would _you_ give for such an\nopportunity of piecing your fortunes by marriage?--Confess the truth.\"\n\n\"I might be tempted, perhaps,\" said Jekyl, \"in my present circumstances;\nbut if they were what they have been, I should despise an estate that\nwas to be held by petticoat tenure, especially when the lady of the\nmanor was a sickly fantastic girl, that hated me, as this Miss Mowbray\nhas the bad taste to hate you.\"\n\n\"Umph--sickly?--no, no, she is not sickly--she is as healthy as any one\nin constitution--and, on my word, I think her paleness only renders her\nmore interesting. The last time I saw her, I thought she might have\nrivalled one of Canova's finest statues.\"\n\n\"Yes; but she is indifferent to you--you do not love her,\" said Jekyl.\n\n\"She is any thing but indifferent to me,\" said the Earl; \"she becomes\ndaily more interesting--for her dislike piques me; and besides, she has\nthe insolence openly to defy and contemn me before her brother, and in\nthe eyes of all the world. I have a kind of loving hatred--a sort of\nhating love for her; in short, thinking upon her is like trying to read\na riddle, and makes one make quite as many blunders, and talk just as\nmuch nonsense. If ever I have the opportunity, I will make her pay for\nall her airs.\"\n\n\"What airs?\" said Jekyl.\n\n\"Nay, the devil may describe them, for I cannot; but, for example--Since\nher brother has insisted on her receiving me, or I should rather say on\nher appearing when I visit Shaws-Castle, one would think her invention\nhas toiled in discovering different ways of showing want of respect to\nme, and dislike to my presence. Instead of dressing herself as a lady\nshould, especially on such occasions, she chooses some fantastic, or\nold-fashioned, or negligent bedizening, which makes her at least look\nodd, if it cannot make her ridiculous--such triple tiaras of\nvarious-coloured gauze on her head--such pieces of old tapestry, I\nthink, instead of shawls and pelisses--such thick-soled shoes--such\ntan-leather gloves--mercy upon us, Hal, the very sight of her equipment\nwould drive mad a whole conclave of milliners! Then her postures are so\nstrange--she does so stoop and lollop, as the women call it, so cross\nher legs and square her arms--were the goddess of grace to look down on\nher, it would put her to flight for ever!\"\n\n\"And you are willing to make this awkward, ill-dressed, unmannered\ndowdy, your Countess, Etherington; you, for whose critical eye half the\ntown dress themselves?\" said Jekyl.\n\n\"It is all a trick, Hal--all an assumed character to get rid of me, to\ndisgust me, to baffle me; but I am not to be had so easily. The brother\nis driven to despair--he bites his nails, winks, coughs, makes signs,\nwhich she always takes up at cross-purpose.--I hope he beats her after I\ngo away; there would be a touch of consolation, were one but certain of\nthat.\"\n\n\"A very charitable hope, truly, and your present feelings might lead the\nlady to judge what she may expect after wedlock. But,\" added Jekyl,\n\"cannot you, so skilful in fathoming every mood of the female mind,\ndivine some mode of engaging her in conversation?\"\n\n\"Conversation!\" replied the Earl; \"why, ever since the shock of my first\nappearance was surmounted, she has contrived to vote me a nonentity; and\nthat she may annihilate me completely, she has chosen, of all\noccupations, that of working a stocking! From what cursed old\nantediluvian, who lived before the invention of spinning-jennies, she\nlearned this craft, Heaven only knows; but there she sits, with her work\npinned to her knee--not the pretty taper silken fabric, with which\nJeannette of Amiens coquetted, while Tristram Shandy was observing her\nprogress; but a huge worsted bag, designed for some flat-footed old\npauper, with heels like an elephant--And there she squats, counting all\nthe stitches as she works, and refusing to speak, or listen, or look up,\nunder pretence that it disturbs her calculation!\"\n\n\"An elegant occupation, truly, and I wonder it does not work a cure upon\nher noble admirer,\" said Jekyl.\n\n\"Confound her--no--she shall not trick me. And then amid this\naffectation of vulgar stolidity, there break out such sparkles of\nexultation, when she thinks she has succeeded in baffling her brother,\nand in plaguing me, that, by my faith, Hal, I could not tell, were it at\nmy option, whether to kiss or to cuff her.\"\n\n\"You are determined to go on with this strange affair, then?\" said\nJekyl.\n\n\"On--on--on, my boy!--Clara and Nettlewood for ever!\" answered the Earl.\n\"Besides this brother of hers provokes me too--he does not do for me\nhalf what he might--what he ought to do. He stands on points of honour,\nforsooth, this broken-down horse-jockey, who swallowed my two thousand\npounds as a pointer would a pat of butter.--I can see he wishes to play\nfast and loose--has some suspicions, like you, Hal, upon the strength of\nmy right to my father's titles and estate; as if, with the tithe of the\nNettlewood property alone, I would not be too good a match for one of\nhis beggarly family. He must scheme, forsooth, this half-baked Scotch\ncake!--He must hold off and on, and be cautious, and wait the result,\nand try conclusions with me, this lump of oatmeal dough!--I am much\ntempted to make an example of him in the course of my proceedings.\"\n\n\"Why, this is vengeance horrible and dire,\" said Jekyl; \"yet I give up\nthe brother to you; he is a conceited coxcomb, and deserves a lesson.\nBut I would fain intercede for the sister.\"\n\n\"We shall see\"--replied the Earl; and then suddenly, \"I tell you what it\nis, Hal; her caprices are so diverting, that I sometimes think out of\nmere contradiction, I almost love her; at least, if she would but clear\nold scores, and forget one unlucky prank of mine, it should be her own\nfault if I did not make her a happy woman.\"\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[II-8] \"Rob as a footpad.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII.\n\nA DEATH-BED.\n\n    It comes--it wrings me in my parting hour,\n    The long-hid crime--the well-disguised guilt.\n    Bring me some holy priest to lay the spectre!\n\n_Old Play._\n\n\nThe general expectation of the company had been disappointed by the\npacific termination of the meeting betwixt the Earl of Etherington and\nTyrrel, the anticipation of which had created so deep a sensation. It\nhad been expected that some appalling scene would have taken place;\ninstead of which, each party seemed to acquiesce in a sullen neutrality,\nand leave the war to be carried on by their lawyers. It was generally\nunderstood that the cause was removed out of the courts of Bellona into\nthat of Themis; and although the litigants continued to inhabit the same\nneighbourhood, and once or twice met at the public walks or public\ntable, they took no notice of each other, farther than by exchanging on\nsuch occasions, a grave and distant bow.\n\nIn the course of two or three days, people ceased to take interest in a\nfeud so coldly conducted; and if they thought of it at all, it was but\nto wonder that both the parties should persevere in residing near the\nSpa, and in chilling, with their unsocial behaviour, a party met\ntogether for the purposes of health and amusement.\n\nBut the brothers, as the reader is aware, however painful their\noccasional meetings might be, had the strongest reasons to remain in\neach other's neighbourhood--Lord Etherington to conduct his design upon\nMiss Mowbray, Tyrrel to disconcert his plan, if possible, and both to\nawait the answer which should be returned by the house in London, who\nwere depositaries of the papers left by the late Earl.\n\nJekyl, anxious to assist his friend as much as possible, made in the\nmeantime a visit to old Touchwood at the Aultoun, expecting to find him\nas communicative as he had formerly been on the subject of the quarrel\nbetwixt the brothers, and trusting to discover, by dint of address,\nwhence he had derived his information concerning the affairs of the\nnoble house of Etherington. But the confidence which he had been induced\nto expect on the part of the old traveller was not reposed. Ferdinand\nMendez Pinto, as the Earl called him, had changed his mind, or was not\nin the vein of communication. The only proof of his confidence worth\nmentioning, was his imparting to the young officer a valuable receipt\nfor concocting curry-powder.\n\nJekyl was therefore reduced to believe that Touchwood, who appeared all\nhis life to have been a great intermeddler in other people's matters,\nhad puzzled out the information which he appeared to possess of Lord\nEtherington's affairs, through some of those obscure sources whence very\nimportant secrets do frequently, to the astonishment and confusion of\nthose whom they concern, escape to the public. He thought this the more\nlikely, as Touchwood was by no means critically nice in his society, but\nwas observed to converse as readily with a gentleman's gentleman, as\nwith the gentleman to whom he belonged, and with a lady's attendant, as\nwith the lady herself. He that will stoop to this sort of society, who\nis fond of tattle, being at the same time disposed to pay some\nconsideration for gratification of his curiosity, and not over\nscrupulous respecting its accuracy, may always command a great quantity\nof private anecdote. Captain Jekyl naturally enough concluded, that this\nbusy old man became in some degree master of other people's affairs by\nsuch correspondences as these; and he could himself bear witness to his\nsuccess in cross-examination, as he had been surprised into an avowal of\nthe rencontre between the brothers, by an insidious observation of the\nsaid Touchwood. He reported, therefore, to the Earl, after this\ninterview, that, on the whole, he thought he had no reason to fear much\non the subject of the traveller, who, though he had become acquainted,\nby some means or other, with some leading facts of his remarkable\nhistory; only possessed them in a broken, confused, and desultory\nmanner, insomuch that he seemed to doubt whether the parties in the\nexpected lawsuit were brothers or cousins, and appeared totally ignorant\nof the facts on which it was to be founded.\n\nIt was the next day after this _\u00c3\u00a9claircissement_ on the subject of\nTouchwood, that Lord Etherington dropped as usual into the bookseller's\nshop, got his papers, and skimming his eye over the shelf on which lay,\ntill called for, the postponed letters destined for the Aultoun, saw\nwith a beating heart the smart post-mistress toss amongst them, with an\nair of sovereign contempt, a pretty large packet, addressed to Francis\nTyrrel, Esq. &c. He withdrew his eyes, as if conscious that even to have\nlooked on this important parcel might engender some suspicion of his\npurpose, or intimate the deep interest which he took in the contents of\nthe missive which was so slightly treated by his friend Mrs. Pott. At\nthis moment the door of the shop opened, and Lady Penelope Penfeather\nentered, with her eternal _pendante_, the little Miss Digges.\n\n\"Have you seen Mr. Mowbray?--Has Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's been down\nthis morning?--Do you know any thing of Mr. Mowbray, Mrs. Pott?\" were\nquestions which the lettered lady eagerly huddled on the back of each\nother, scarcely giving time to the lady of letters to return a decided\nnegative to all and each of them.\n\n\"Mr. Mowbray was not about--was not coming there this morning--his\nservant had just called for letters and papers, and announced as much.\"\n\n\"Good Heaven! how unfortunate!\" said Lady Penelope, with a deep sigh,\nand sinking down on one of the little sofas in an attitude of shocking\ndesolation, which called the instant attention of Mr. Pott and his good\nwoman, the first uncorking a small phial of salts, for he was a\npharmacopolist as well as vender of literature and transmitter of\nletters, and the other hastening for a glass of water. A strong\ntemptation thrilled from Lord Etherington's eyes to his finger-ends. Two\nsteps might have brought him within arm's-length of the unwatched\npacket, on the contents of which, in all probability, rested the hope\nand claims of his rival in honour and fortune; and, in the general\nconfusion, was it impossible to possess himself of it unobserved? But\nno--no--no--the attempt was too dreadfully dangerous to be risked; and,\npassing from one extreme to another, he felt as if he was incurring\nsuspicion by suffering Lady Penelope to play off her airs of affected\ndistress and anxiety, without seeming to take that interest in them\nwhich her rank at least might be supposed to demand. Stung with this\napprehension, he hastened to express himself so anxiously on the\nsubject, and to demonstrate so busily his wish to assist her ladyship,\nthat he presently stood committed a great deal farther than he had\nintended. Lady Penelope was infinitely obliged to his lordship--indeed,\nit was her character in general not to permit herself to be overcome by\ncircumstances; but something had happened, so strange, so embarrassing,\nso melancholy, that she owned it had quite overcome her--notwithstanding,\nshe had at all times piqued herself on supporting her own distresses,\nbetter than she was able to suppress her emotions in viewing those of\nothers.\n\n\"Could he be of any use?\" Lord Etherington asked. \"She had enquired\nafter Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's--his servant was at her ladyship's\nservice, if she chose to send to command his attendance.\"\n\n\"Oh! no, no!\" said Lady Penelope; \"I dare say, my dear lord, you will\nanswer the purpose a great deal better than Mr. Mowbray--that is,\nprovided you are a Justice of Peace.\"\n\n\"A Justice of Peace!\" said Lord Etherington, much surprised; \"I am in\nthe commission unquestionably, but not for any Scotch county.\"\n\n\"O, that does not signify,\" said Lady Penelope; \"and if you will trust\nyourself with me a little way, I will explain to you how you can do one\nof the most charitable, and kind, and generous things in the world.\"\n\nLord Etherington's delight in the exercise of charity, kindness, and\ngenerosity, was not so exuberant as to prevent his devising some means\nfor evading Lady Penelope's request, when, looking through the\nsash-door, he had a distant glance of his servant Solmes approaching the\nPost-office.\n\nI have heard of a sheep-stealer who had rendered his dog so skilful an\naccomplice in his nefarious traffic, that he used to send him out to\ncommit acts of felony by himself, and had even contrived to impress on\nthe poor cur the caution that he should not, on such occasions, seem\neven to recognise his master, if they met accidentally.[II-9] Apparently,\nLord Etherington conducted himself upon a similar principle; for he had\nno sooner a glimpse of his agent, than he seemed to feel the necessity\nof leaving the stage free for his machinations.\n\n\"My servant,\" he said, with as much indifference as he could assume,\n\"will call for my letters--I must attend Lady Penelope;\" and, instantly\nproffering his services as Justice of the Peace, or in whatever other\nquality she chose to employ them, he hastily presented his arm, and\nscarce gave her ladyship time to recover from her state of languor to\nthe necessary degree of activity, ere he hurried her from the shop; and,\nwith her thin hatchet-face chattering close to his ear, her yellow and\nscarlet feathers crossing his nose, her lean right honourable arm\nhooking his elbow, he braved the suppressed titters and sneers of all\nthe younger women whom he met as they traversed the parade. One glance\nof intelligence, though shot at a distance, passed betwixt his lordship\nand Solmes, as the former left the public walk under the guidance of\nLady Penelope, his limbs indeed obeying her pleasure, and his ears\ndinned with her attempts to explain the business in question, but his\nmind totally indifferent where he was going, or ignorant on what\npurpose, and exclusively occupied with the packet in Mrs. Pott's heap of\npostponed letters, and its probable fate.\n\nAt length an effort of recollection made Lord Etherington sensible that\nhis abstraction must seem strange, and, as his conscience told him, even\nsuspicious in the eyes of his companion; putting therefore the necessary\ndegree of constraint upon himself, he expressed, for the first time,\ncuriosity to know where their walk was to terminate. It chanced, that\nthis was precisely the question which he needed not to have asked, if he\nhad paid but the slightest attention to the very voluble communications\nof her ladyship, which had all turned upon this subject.\n\n\"Now, my dear lord,\" she said, \"I must believe you lords of the creation\nthink us poor simple women the vainest fools alive. I have told you how\nmuch pain it costs me to speak about my little charities, and yet you\ncome to make me tell you the whole story over again. But I hope, after\nall, your lordship is not surprised at what I have thought it my duty to\ndo in this sad affair--perhaps I have listened too much to the dictates\nof my own heart, which are apt to be so deceitful.\"\n\nOn the watch to get at something explanatory, yet afraid, by demanding\nit directly, to show that the previous tide of narrative and pathos had\nbeen lost on an inattentive ear, Lord Etherington could only say, that\nLady Penelope could not err in acting according to the dictates of her\nown judgment.\n\nStill the compliment had not sauce enough for the lady's sated palate;\nso, like a true glutton of praise, she began to help herself with the\nsoup-ladle.\n\n\"Ah! judgment?--how is it you men know us so little, that you think we\ncan pause to weigh sentiment in the balance of judgment?--that is\nexpecting rather too much from us poor victims of our feelings. So that\nyou must really hold me excused if I forgot the errors of this guilty\nand unhappy creature, when I looked upon her wretchedness--Not that I\nwould have my little friend, Miss Digges, or your lordship, suppose that\nI am capable of palliating the fault, while I pity the poor, miserable\nsinner. Oh, no--Walpole's verses express beautifully what one ought to\nfeel on such occasions--\n\n    'For never was the gentle breast\n      Insensible to human woes;\n    Feeling, though firm, it melts distress'd\n      For weaknesses it never knows.'\"\n\n\"Most accursed of all _pr\u00c3\u00a9cieuses_,\" thought his lordship, \"when wilt\nthou, amidst all thy chatter, utter one word sounding like sense or\ninformation!\"\n\nBut, Lady Penelope went on--\"If you knew, my lord, how I lament my\nlimited means on those occasions! but I have gathered something among\nthe good people at the Well. I asked that selfish wretch, Winterblossom,\nto walk down with me to view her distress, and the heartless beast told\nme he was afraid of infection!--infection from a puer--puerperal fever!\nI should not perhaps pronounce the word, but science is of no\nsex--however, I have always used thieves' vinegar essence, and never\nhave gone farther than the threshold.\"\n\nWhatever were Etherington's faults, he did not want charity, so far as\nit consists in giving alms.\n\n\"I am sorry,\" he said, taking out his purse, \"your ladyship should not\nhave applied to me.\"\n\n\"Pardon me, my lord, we only beg from our friends; and your lordship is\nso constantly engaged with Lady Binks, that we have rarely the pleasure\nof seeing you in what I call _my_ little circle.\"\n\nLord Etherington, without further answer, tendered a couple of guineas,\nand observed, that the poor woman should have medical attendance.\n\n\"Why, so I say,\" answered Lady Penelope; \"and I asked the brute\nQuackleben, who, I am sure, owes me some gratitude, to go and see her;\nbut the sordid monster answered, 'Who was to pay him?'--He grows every\nday more intolerable, now that he seems sure of marrying that fat blowzy\nwidow. He could not, I am sure, expect that I--out of my pittance--And\nbesides, my lord, is there not a law that the parish, or the county, or\nthe something or other, shall pay for physicking the poor?\"\n\n\"We will find means to secure the Doctor's attendance,\" said Lord\nEtherington; \"and I believe my best way will be to walk back to the\nWell, and send him to wait on the patient. I am afraid I can be of\nlittle use to a poor woman in a childbed fever.\"\n\n\"Puerperal, my lord, puerperal,\" said Lady Penelope, in a tone of\ncorrection.\n\n\"In a puerperal fever, then,\" said Lord Etherington; \"why, what can I do\nto help her?\"\n\n\"Oh! my lord, you have forgotten that this Anne Heggie, that I told you\nof, came here with one child in her arms--and another--in short, about\nto become a mother again--and settled herself in this miserable hut I\ntold you of--and some people think the minister should have sent her to\nher own parish; but he is a strange, soft-headed, sleepy sort of man,\nnot over active in his parochial duties. However, there she settled, and\nthere was something about her quite beyond the style of a common pauper,\nmy lord--not at all the disgusting sort of person that you give a\nsixpence to while you look another way--but some one that seemed to have\nseen better days--one that, as Shakspeare says, could a tale\nunfold--though, indeed, I have never thoroughly learned her\nhistory--only, that to-day, as I called to know how she was, and sent my\nmaid into her hut with some trifle, not worth mentioning, I find there\nis something hangs about her mind concerning the Mowbray family here of\nSt. Ronan's--and my woman says the poor creature is dying, and is raving\neither for Mr. Mowbray or for some magistrate to receive a declaration;\nand so I have given you the trouble to come with me, that we may get out\nof the poor creature, if possible, whatever she has got to say.--I hope\nit is not murder--I hope not--though young St. Ronan's has been a\nstrange, wild, daring, thoughtless creature--_sgherro insigne_, as the\nItalian says.--But here is the hut, my lord--pray, walk in.\"\n\nThe mention of the St. Ronan's family, and of a secret relating to them,\nbanished the thoughts which Lord Etherington began to entertain of\nleaving Lady Penelope to execute her works of devoted charity without\nhis assistance. It was now with an interest equal to her own, that he\nstood before a most miserable hut, where the unfortunate female, her\ndistresses not greatly relieved by Lady Penelope's ostentatious bounty,\nhad resided both previous to her confinement, and since that event had\ntaken place, with an old woman, one of the parish poor, whose miserable\ndole the minister had augmented, that she might have some means of\nassisting the stranger.\n\nLady Penelope lifted the latch and entered, after a momentary\nhesitation, which proceeded from a struggle betwixt her fear of\ninfection, and her eager curiosity to know something, she could not\nguess what, that might affect the Mowbrays in their honour or fortunes.\nThe latter soon prevailed, and she entered, followed by Lord\nEtherington. The lady, like other comforters of the cabins of the poor,\nproceeded to rebuke the grumbling old woman for want of order and\ncleanliness--censured the food which was provided for the patient, and\nenquired particularly after the wine which she had left to make caudle\nwith. The crone was not so dazzled with Lady Penelope's dignity or\nbounty as to endure her reprimand with patience. \"They that had their\nbread to won wi' ae arm,\" she said, for the other hung powerless by her\nside, \"had mair to do than to soop hooses; if her leddyship wad let her\nain idle quean of a lass take the besom, she might make the house as\nclean as she liked; and madam wad be a' the better of the exercise, and\nwad hae done, at least, ae turn of wark at the week's end.\"\n\n\"Do you hear the old hag, my lord?\" said Lady Penelope. \"Well, the poor\nare horrid ungrateful wretches--And the wine, dame--the wine?\"\n\n\"The wine!--there was hardly half a mutchkin, and puir, thin, fusionless\nskink it was--the wine was drank out, ye may swear--we didna fling it\nower our shouther--if ever we were to get good o't, it was by taking it\nnaked, and no wi' your sugar and your slaisters--I wish, for ane, I had\nne'er kend the sour smack o't. If the bedral hadna gien me a drap of\nusquebaugh, I might e'en hae died of your leddyship's liquor, for\"----\n\nLord Etherington here interrupted the grumbling crone, thrusting some\nsilver into her grasp, and at the same time begging her to be silent.\nThe hag weighed the crown-piece in her hand, and crawled to her\nchimney-corner, muttering as she went,--\"This is something like--this is\nsomething like--no like rinning into the house and out of the house, and\ngeeing orders, like mistress and mair, and than a puir shilling again\nSaturday at e'en.\"\n\nSo saying, she sat down to her wheel, and seized, while she spun, her\njet-black cutty pipe, from which she soon sent such clouds of vile\nmundungus vapour as must have cleared the premises of Lady Penelope, had\nshe not been strong in purpose to share the expected confession of the\ninvalid. As for Miss Digges, she coughed, sneezed, retched, and finally\nran out of the cottage, declaring she could not live in such a smoke, if\nit were to hear twenty sick women's last speeches; and that, besides,\nshe was sure to know all about it from Lady Penelope, if it was ever so\nlittle worth telling over again.\n\nLord Etherington was now standing beside the miserable flock-bed, in\nwhich lay the poor patient, distracted, in what seemed to be her dying\nmoments, with the peevish clamour of the elder infant, to which she\ncould only reply by low moans, turning her looks as well as she could\nfrom its ceaseless whine to the other side of her wretched couch, where\nlay the unlucky creature to which she had last given birth; its\nshivering limbs imperfectly covered with a blanket, its little features\nalready swollen and bloated, and its eyes scarce open, apparently\ninsensible to the evils of a state from which it seemed about to be\nspeedily released.\n\n\"You are very ill, poor woman,\" said Lord Etherington; \"I am told you\ndesire a magistrate.\"\n\n\"It was Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's, whom I desired to see--John Mowbray\nof St. Ronan's--the lady promised to bring him here.\"\n\n\"I am not Mowbray of St. Ronan's,\" said Lord Etherington; \"but I am a\njustice of peace, and a member of the legislature--I am, moreover, Mr.\nMowbray's particular friend, if I can be of use to you in any of these\ncapacities.\"\n\nThe poor woman remained long silent, and when she spoke it was\ndoubtfully.\n\n\"Is my Lady Penelope Penfeather there?\" she said, straining her darkened\neyes.\n\n\"Her ladyship is present, and within hearing,\" said Lord Etherington.\n\n\"My case is the worse,\" answered the dying woman, for so she seemed, \"if\nI must communicate such a secret as mine to a man of whom I know\nnothing, and a woman of whom I only know that she wants discretion.\"\n\n\"I--I want discretion!\" said Lady Penelope; but at a signal from Lord\nEtherington she seemed to restrain herself; nor did the sick woman,\nwhose powers of observation were greatly impaired, seem to be aware of\nthe interruption. She spoke, notwithstanding her situation, with an\nintelligible and even emphatic voice; her manner in a great measure\nbetraying the influence of the fever, and her tone and language seeming\nmuch superior to her most miserable condition.\n\n\"I am not the abject creature which I seem,\" she said; \"at least, I was\nnot born to be so. I wish I _were_ that utter abject! I wish I were a\nwretched pauper of the lowest class--a starving vagabond--a wifeless\nmother--ignorance and insensibility would make me bear my lot like the\noutcast animal that dies patiently on the side of the common, where it\nhas been half-starved during its life. But I--but I--born and bred to\nbetter things, have not lost the memory of them, and they make my\npresent condition--my shame--my poverty--my infamy--the sight of my\ndying babes--the sense that my own death is coming fast on--they make\nthese things a foretaste of hell!\"\n\nLady Penelope's self-conceit and affectation were broken down by this\nfearful exordium. She sobbed, shuddered, and, for once perhaps in her\nlife, felt the real, not the assumed necessity, of putting her\nhandkerchief to her eyes. Lord Etherington also was moved.\n\n\"Good woman,\" he said, \"as far as relieving your personal wants can\nmitigate your distress, I will see that that is fully performed, and\nthat your poor children are attended to.\"\n\n\"May God bless you!\" said the poor woman, with a glance at the wretched\nforms beside her; \"and may you,\" she added, after a momentary pause,\n\"deserve the blessing of God, for it is bestowed in vain on those who\nare unworthy of it!\"\n\nLord Etherington felt, perhaps, a twinge of conscience; for he said,\nsomething hastily, \"Pray go on, good woman, if you really have any thing\nto communicate to me as a magistrate--it is time your condition was\nsomewhat mended, and I will cause you to be cared for directly.\"\n\n\"Stop yet a moment,\" she said; \"let me unload my conscience before I go\nhence, for no earthly relief will long avail to prolong my time here.--I\nwas well born, the more my present shame! well educated, the greater my\npresent guilt!--I was always, indeed, poor, but I felt not of the ills\nof poverty. I only thought of it when my vanity demanded idle and\nexpensive gratifications, for real wants I knew none. I was companion of\na young lady of higher rank than my own, my relative however, and one of\nsuch exquisite kindness of disposition, that she treated me as a sister,\nand would have shared with me all that she had on earth----I scarce\nthink I can go farther with my story!--something rises to my throat when\nI recollect how I rewarded her sisterly love!--I was elder than Clara--I\nshould have directed her reading, and confirmed her understanding; but\nmy own bent led me to peruse only works, which, though they burlesque\nnature, are seductive to the imagination. We read these follies\ntogether, until we had fashioned out for ourselves a little world of\nromance, and prepared ourselves for a maze of adventures. Clara's\nimaginations were as pure as those of angels; mine were--but it is\nunnecessary to tell them. The fiend, always watchful, presented a\ntempter at the moment when it was most dangerous.\"\n\nShe paused here, as if she found difficulty in expressing herself; and\nLord Etherington, turning, with great appearance of interest, to Lady\nPenelope, began to enquire, \"Whether it were quite agreeable to her\nladyship to remain any longer an ear-witness of this unfortunate's\nconfession?--it seems to be verging on some things--things that it might\nbe unpleasant for your ladyship to hear.\"\n\n\"I was just forming the same opinion, my lord; and, to say truth, was\nabout to propose to your lordship to withdraw, and leave me alone with\nthe poor woman. My sex will make her necessary communications more frank\nin your lordship's absence.\"\n\n\"True, madam; but then I am called here in my capacity of a magistrate.\"\n\n\"Hush!\" said Lady Penelope; \"she speaks.\"\n\n\"They say every woman that yields, makes herself a slave to her seducer;\nbut I sold my liberty not to a man, but a demon! He made me serve him in\nhis vile schemes against my friend and patroness--and oh! he found in me\nan agent too willing, from mere envy, to destroy the virtue which I had\nlost myself. Do not listen to me any more--Go, and leave me to my fate!\nI am the most detestable wretch that ever lived--detestable to myself\nworst of all, because even in my penitence there is a secret whisper\nthat tells me, that were I as I have been, I would again act over all\nthe wickedness I have done, and much worse. Oh! for Heaven's assistance,\nto crush the wicked thought!\"\n\nShe closed her eyes, folded her emaciated hands, and held them upwards\nin the attitude of one who prays internally; presently the hands\nseparated, and fell gently down on the miserable couch; but her eyes did\nnot open, nor was there the slightest sign of motion in the features.\nLady Penelope shrieked faintly, hid her eyes, and hurried back from the\nbed, while Lord Etherington, his looks darkening with a complication of\nfeelings, remained gazing on the poor woman, as if eager to discern\nwhether the spark of life was totally extinct. Her grim old assistant\nhurried to the bedside, with some spirits in a broken glass.\n\n\"Have ye no had pennyworths for your charity?\" she said, in spiteful\nscorn. \"Ye buy the very life o' us wi' your shillings and sixpences,\nyour groats and your boddles--ye hae garr'd the puir wretch speak till\nshe swarfs, and now ye stand as if ye never saw a woman in a dwam\nbefore? Let me till her wi' the dram--mony words mickle drought, ye\nken--Stand out o' my gate, my leddy, if sae be that ye are a leddy;\nthere is little use of the like of you when there is death in the pot.\"\n\nLady Penelope, half affronted, but still more frightened by the manners\nof the old hag, now gladly embraced Lord Etherington's renewed offer to\nescort her from the hut. He left it not, however, without bestowing an\nadditional gratuity on the old woman, who received it with a whining\nbenediction.\n\n\"The Almighty guide your course through the troubles of this wicked\nwarld--and the muckle deevil blaw wind in your sails,\" she added, in her\nnatural tone, as the guests vanished from her miserable threshold. \"A\nwheen cork-headed, barmy-brained gowks! that wunna let puir folk sae\nmuckle as die in quiet, wi' their sossings and their soopings.\"[II-10]\n\n\"This poor creature's declaration,\" said Lord Etherington to Lady\nPenelope, \"seems to refer to matters which the law has nothing to do\nwith, and which, perhaps, as they seem to implicate the peace of a\nfamily of respectability, and the character of a young lady, we ought to\nenquire no farther after.\"\n\n\"I differ from your lordship,\" said Lady Penelope; \"I differ\nextremely--I suppose you guess whom her discourse touched upon?\"\n\n\"Indeed, your ladyship does my acuteness too much honour.\"\n\n\"Did she not mention a Christian name?\" said Lady Penelope; \"your\nlordship is strangely dull this morning!\"\n\n\"A Christian name?--No, none that I heard--yes, she said something\nabout--a Catherine, I think it was.\"\n\n\"Catherine!\" answered the lady; \"No, my lord, it was Clara--rather a\nrare name in this country, and belonging, I think, to a young lady of\nwhom your lordship should know something, unless your evening\nflirtations with Lady Binks have blotted entirely out of your memory\nyour morning visits to Shaws-Castle. You are a bold man, my lord. I\nwould advise you to include Mrs. Blower among the objects of your\nattention, and then you will have maid, wife, and widow upon your list.\"\n\n\"Upon my honour, your ladyship is too severe,\" said Lord Etherington;\n\"you surround yourself every evening with all that is clever and\naccomplished among the people here, and then you ridicule a poor\nsecluded monster, who dare not approach your charmed circle, because he\nseeks for some amusement elsewhere. This is to tyrannize and not to\nreign--it is Turkish despotism!\"\n\n\"Ah! my lord, I know you well, my lord,\" said Lady Penelope--\"Sorry\nwould your lordship be, had you not power to render yourself welcome to\nany circle which you may please to approach.\"\n\n\"That is to say,\" answered the lord, \"you will pardon me if I intrude on\nyour ladyship's coterie this evening?\"\n\n\"There is no society which Lord Etherington can think of frequenting,\nwhere he will not be a welcome guest.\"\n\n\"I will plead then at once my pardon and privilege this evening--And\nnow,\" (speaking as if he had succeeded in establishing some confidence\nwith her ladyship,) \"what do you really think of this blind story?\"\n\n\"O, I must believe it concerns Miss Mowbray. She was always an odd\ngirl--something about her I could never endure--a sort of\neffrontery--that is, perhaps, a harsh word, but a kind of assurance--an\nair of confidence--so that though I kept on a footing with her, because\nshe was an orphan girl of good family, and because I really knew nothing\npositively bad of her, yet she sometimes absolutely shocked me.\"\n\n\"Your ladyship, perhaps, would not think it right to give publicity to\nthe story? at least, till you know exactly what it is,\" said the Earl,\nin a tone of suggestion.\n\n\"Depend upon it, that it is quite the worst, the very worst--You heard\nthe woman say that she had exposed Clara to ruin--and you know she must\nhave meant Clara Mowbray, because she was so anxious to tell the story\nto her brother, St. Ronan's.\"\n\n\"Very true--I did not think of that,\" answered Lord Etherington; \"still\nit would be hard on the poor girl if it should get abroad.\"\n\n\"O, it will never get abroad for me,\" said Lady Penelope; \"I would not\ntell the very wind of it. But then I cannot meet Miss Mowbray as\nformerly--I have a station in life to maintain, my lord--and I am under\nthe necessity of being select in my society--it is a duty I owe the\npublic, if it were even not my own inclination.\"\n\n\"Certainly, my Lady Penelope,\" said Lord Etherington; \"but then\nconsider, that, in a place where all eyes are necessarily observant of\nyour ladyship's behaviour, the least coldness on your part to Miss\nMowbray--and, after all, we have nothing like assurance of any thing\nbeing wrong there--would ruin her with the company here, and with the\nworld at large.\"\n\n\"Oh! my lord,\" answered Lady Penelope, \"as for the truth of the story, I\nhave some private reasons of my own for 'holding the strange tale\ndevoutly true;' for I had a mysterious hint from a very worthy, but a\nvery singular man, (your lordship knows how I adore originality,) the\nclergyman of the parish, who made me aware there was something wrong\nabout Miss Clara--something that--your lordship will excuse my speaking\nmore plainly,--Oh, no!--I fear--I fear it is all too true--You know Mr.\nCargill, I suppose, my lord?\"\n\n\"Yes--no--I--I think I have seen him,\" said Lord Etherington. \"But how\ncame the lady to make the parson her father-confessor?--they have no\nauricular confession in the Kirk--it must have been with the purpose of\nmarriage, I presume--let us hope that it took place--perhaps it really\nwas so--did he, Cargill--the minister, I mean--say any thing of such a\nmatter?\"\n\n\"Not a word--not a word--I see where you are, my lord; you would put a\ngood face on't.--\n\n    'They call'd it marriage, by that specious name\n    To veil the crime, and sanctify the shame.'\n\nQueen Dido for that. How the clergyman came into the secret I cannot\ntell--he is a very close man. But I know he will not hear of Miss\nMowbray being married to any one, unquestionably because he knows that,\nin doing so, she would introduce disgrace into some honest family--and,\ntruly, I am much of his mind, my lord.\"\n\n\"Perhaps Mr. Cargill may know the lady is privately married already,\"\nsaid the Earl; \"I think that is the more natural inference, begging your\nladyship's pardon for presuming to differ in opinion.\"\n\nLady Penelope seemed determined not to take this view of the case.\n\n\"No, no--no, I tell you,\" she replied; \"she cannot be married, for if\nshe were married, how could the poor wretch say that she was\nruined?--You know there is a difference betwixt ruin and marriage.\"\n\n\"Some people are said to have found them synonymous, Lady Penelope,\"\nanswered the Earl.\n\n\"You are smart on me, my lord; but still, in common parlance, when we\nsay a woman is ruined, we mean quite the contrary of her being\nmarried--it is impossible for me to be more explicit upon such a topic,\nmy lord.\"\n\n\"I defer to your ladyship's better judgment,\" said Lord Etherington. \"I\nonly entreat you to observe a little caution in this business--I will\nmake the strictest enquiries of this woman, and acquaint you with the\nresult; and I hope, out of regard to the respectable family of St.\nRonan's, your ladyship will be in no hurry to intimate any thing to Miss\nMowbray's prejudice.\"\n\n\"I certainly am no person to spread scandal, my lord,\" answered the\nlady, drawing herself up; \"at the same time, I must say, the Mowbrays\nhave little claim on me for forbearance. I am sure I was the first\nperson to bring this Spa into fashion, which has been a matter of such\nconsequence to their estate; and yet Mr. Mowbray set himself against me,\nmy lord, in every possible sort of way, and encouraged the under-bred\npeople about him to behave very strangely.--There was the business of\nbuilding the Belvidere, which he would not permit to be done out of the\nstock-purse of the company, because I had given the workmen the plan and\nthe orders--and then, about the tea-room--and the hour for beginning\ndancing--and about the subscription for Mr. Rymour's new Tale of\nChivalry--in short, I owe no consideration to Mr. Mowbray of St.\nRonan's.\"\n\n\"But the poor young lady?\" said Lord Etherington.\n\n\"Oh! the poor young lady?--the poor young lady can be as saucy as a rich\nyoung lady, I promise you.--There was a business in which she used me\nscandalously, Lord Etherington--it was about a very trifling matter--a\nshawl. Nobody minds dress less than I do, my lord; I thank Heaven my\nthoughts turn upon very different topics--but it is in trifles that\ndisrespect and unkindness are shown; and I have had a full share of both\nfrom Miss Clara, besides a good deal of impertinence from her brother\nupon the same subject.\"\n\n\"There is but one way remains,\" thought the Earl, as they approached the\nSpa, \"and that is to work on the fears of this d--d vindictive\nblue-stocking'd wild-cat.--Your ladyship,\" he said aloud, \"is aware what\nsevere damages have been awarded in late cases where something\napproaching to scandal has been traced to ladies of consideration--the\nprivileges of the tea-table have been found insufficient to protect some\nfair critics against the consequences of too frank and liberal\nanimadversion upon the characters of their friends. So pray, remember,\nthat as yet we know very little on this subject.\"\n\nLady Penelope loved money, and feared the law; and this hint, fortified\nby her acquaintance with Mowbray's love of his sister, and his irritable\nand revengeful disposition, brought her in a moment much nearer the\ntemper in which Lord Etherington wished to leave her. She protested,\nthat no one could be more tender than she of the fame of the\nunfortunate, even supposing their guilt was fully proved--promised\ncaution on the subject of the pauper's declaration, and hoped Lord\nEtherington would join her tea-party early in the evening, as she wished\nto make him acquainted with one or two of her _proteg\u00c3\u00a9s_, whom, she was\nsure, his lordship would find deserving of his advice and countenance.\nBeing by this time at the door of her own apartment, her ladyship took\nleave of the Earl with a most gracious smile.\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[II-9] Note I.\n\n[II-10] Note II.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV.\n\nDISAPPOINTMENT.\n\n    On the lee-beam lies the land, boys,\n      See all clear to reef each course;\n    Let the fore-sheet go, don't mind, boys,\n      Though the weather should be worse.\n\n_The Storm._\n\n\n\"It darkens round me like a tempest,\" thought Lord Etherington, as, with\nslow step, folded arms, and his white hat slouched over his brows, he\ntraversed the short interval of space betwixt his own apartments and\nthose of the Lady Penelope. In a buck of the old school, one of\nCongreve's men of wit and pleasure about town, this would have been a\ndeparture from character; but the present fine man does not derogate\nfrom his quality, even by exhibiting all the moody and gentlemanlike\nsolemnity of Master Stephen.[II-C] So, Lord Etherington was at liberty to\ncarry on his reflections, without attracting observation.--\"I have put a\nstopper into the mouth of that old vinegar-cruet of quality, but the\nacidity of her temper will soon dissolve the charm--And what to do?\"\n\nAs he looked round him, he saw his trusty valet Solmes, who, touching\nhis hat with due respect, said, as he passed him, \"Your lordship's\nletters are in your private dispatch-box.\"\n\nSimple as these words were, and indifferent the tone in which they were\nspoken, their import made Lord Etherington's heart bound as if his fate\nhad depended on the accents. He intimated no farther interest in the\ncommunication, however, than to desire Solmes to be below, in case he\nshould ring; and with these words entered his apartment, and barred and\nbolted the door, even before he looked on the table where his\ndispatch-box was placed.\n\nLord Etherington had, as is usual, one key to the box which held his\nletters, his confidential servant being intrusted with the other; so\nthat, under the protection of a patent lock, his dispatches escaped all\nrisk of being tampered with,--a precaution not altogether unnecessary on\nthe part of those who frequent hotels and lodging-houses.\n\n\"By your leave, Mr. Bramah,\" said the Earl, as he applied the key,\njesting, as it were, with his own agitation, as he would have done with\nthat of a third party. The lid was raised, and displayed the packet, the\nappearance and superscription of which had attracted his observation but\na short while before in the post-office. _Then_ he would have given much\nto be possessed of the opportunity which was now in his power; but many\npause on the brink of a crime, who have contemplated it at a distance\nwithout scruple. Lord Etherington's first impulse had led him to poke\nthe fire; and he held in his hand the letter which he was more than half\ntempted to commit, without even breaking the seal, to the fiery element.\nBut, though sufficiently familiarized with guilt, he was not as yet\nacquainted with it in its basest shapes--he had not yet acted with\nmeanness, or at least with what the world terms such. He had been a\nduellist, the manners of the age authorized it--a libertine, the world\nexcused it to his youth and condition--a bold and successful gambler,\nfor that quality he was admired and envied; and a thousand other\ninaccuracies, to which these practices and habits lead, were easily\nslurred over in a man of quality, with fortune and spirit to support his\nrank. But his present meditated act was of a different kind. Tell it not\nin Bond Street, whisper it not on St. James's pavement!--it amounted to\nan act of petty larceny, for which the code of honour would admit of no\ncomposition.\n\nLord Etherington, under the influence of these recollections, stood for\na few minutes suspended--But the devil always finds logic to convince\nhis followers. He recollected the wrong done to his mother, and to\nhimself, her offspring, to whom his father had, in the face of the whole\nworld, imparted the hereditary rights, of which he was now, by a\nposthumous deed, endeavouring to deprive the memory of the one and the\nexpectations of the other. Surely, the right being his own, he had a\nfull title, by the most effectual means, whatever such means might be,\nto repel all attacks on that right, and even destroy, if necessary, the\ndocuments by which his enemies were prosecuting their unjust plans\nagainst his honour and interest.\n\nThis reasoning prevailed, and Lord Etherington again held the devoted\npacket above the flames; when it occurred to him, that, his resolution\nbeing taken, he ought to carry it into execution as effectually as\npossible; and to do so, it was necessary to know, that the packet\nactually contained the papers which he was desirous to destroy.\n\nNever did a doubt arise in juster time; for no sooner had the seal\nburst, and the envelope rustled under his fingers, than he perceived, to\nhis utter consternation, that he held in his hand only the copies of\nthe deeds for which Francis Tyrrel had written, the originals of which\nhe had too sanguinely concluded would be forwarded according to his\nrequisition. A letter from a partner of the house with which they were\ndeposited, stated, that they had not felt themselves at liberty, in the\nabsence of the head of their firm, to whom these papers had been\ncommitted, to part with them even to Mr. Tyrrel, though they had\nproceeded so far as to open the parcel, and now transmitted to him\nformal copies of the papers contained in it, which, they presumed, would\nserve Mr. Tyrrel's purpose for consulting counsel, or the like. They\nthemselves, in a case of so much delicacy, and in the absence of their\nprincipal partner, were determined to retain the originals, unless\ncalled to produce them in a court of justice.\n\nWith a solemn imprecation on the formality and absurdity of the writer,\nLord Etherington let the letter of advice drop from his hand into the\nfire, and throwing himself into a chair, passed his hand across his\neyes, as if their very power of sight had been blighted by what he had\nread. His title, and his paternal fortune, which he thought but an\ninstant before might be rendered unchallengeable by a single movement of\nhis hand, seemed now on the verge of being lost for ever. His rapid\nrecollection failed not to remind him of what was less known to the\nworld, that his early and profuse expenditure had greatly dilapidated\nhis maternal fortune; and that the estate of Nettlewood, which five\nminutes ago he only coveted as a wealthy man desires increase of his\nstore, must now be acquired, if he would avoid being a poor and\nembarrassed spendthrift. To impede his possessing himself of this\nproperty, fate had restored to the scene the penitent of the morning,\nwho, as he had too much reason to believe, was returned to this\nneighbourhood, to do justice to Clara Mowbray, and who was not unlikely\nto put the whole story of the marriage on its right footing. She,\nhowever, might be got rid of; and it might still be possible to hurry\nMiss Mowbray, by working on her fears, or through the agency of her\nbrother, into a union with him while he still preserved the title of\nLord Etherington. This, therefore, he resolved to secure, if effort or\nif intrigue could carry the point; nor was it the least consideration,\nthat, should he succeed, he would obtain over Tyrrel, his successful\nrival, such a triumph, as would be sufficient to embitter the\ntranquillity of his whole life.\n\nIn a few minutes, his rapid and contriving invention had formed a plan\nfor securing the sole advantage which seemed to remain open for him; and\nconscious that he had no time to lose, he entered immediately upon the\nexecution.\n\nThe bell summoned Solmes to his lordship's apartment, when the Earl, as\ncoolly as if he had hoped to dupe his experienced valet by such an\nassertion, said, \"You have brought me a packet designed for some man at\nthe Aultoun--let it be sent to him--Stay,--I will re-seal it first.\"\n\nHe accordingly re-sealed the packet, containing all the writings,\nexcepting the letter of advice, (which he had burnt,) and gave it to the\nvalet, with the caution, \"I wish you would not make such blunders in\nfuture.\"\n\n\"I beg your lordship's pardon--I will take better care again--thought it\nwas addressed to your lordship.\"\n\nSo answered Solmes, too knowing to give the least look of intelligence,\nfar less to remind the Earl that his own directions had occasioned the\nmistake of which he complained.\n\n\"Solmes,\" continued the Earl, \"you need not mention your blunder at the\npost-office; it would only occasion tattle in this idle place--but be\nsure that the gentleman has his letter.--And, Solmes, I see Mr. Mowbray\nwalk across--ask him to dine with me to-day at five. I have a headache,\nand cannot face the clamour of the savages who feed at the public\ntable.--And let me see--make my compliments to Lady Penelope\nPenfeather--I will certainly have the honour of waiting on her ladyship\nthis evening to tea, agreeably to her very boring invitation\nreceived--write her a proper card, and word it your own way. Bespeak\ndinner for two, and see you have some of that batch of Burgundy.\" The\nservant was retiring, when his master added, \"Stay a moment--I have a\nmore important business than I have yet mentioned.--Solmes, you have\nmanaged devilish ill about the woman Irwin!\"\n\n\"I, my lord?\" answered Solmes.\n\n\"Yes, you, sir--did you not tell me she had gone to the West Indies with\na friend of yours, and did not I give them a couple of hundred pounds\nfor passage-money?\"\n\n\"Yes, my lord,\" replied the valet.\n\n\"Ay, but now it proves _no_, my lord,\" said Lord Etherington; \"for she\nhas found her way back to this country in miserable plight--half-starved,\nand, no doubt, willing to do or say any thing for a livelihood--How has\nthis happened?\"\n\n\"Biddulph must have taken her cash, and turned her loose, my lord,\"\nanswered Solmes, as if he had been speaking of the most commonplace\ntransaction in the world; \"but I know the woman's nature so well, and am\nso much master of her history, that I can carry her off the country in\ntwenty-four hours, and place her where she will never think of\nreturning, provided your lordship can spare me so long.\"\n\n\"About it directly--but I can tell you, that you will find the woman in\na very penitential humour, and very ill in health to boot.\"\n\n\"I am sure of my game,\" answered Solmes; \"with submission to your\nlordship, I think if death and her good angel had hold of one of that\nwoman's arms, the devil and I could make a shift to lead her away by the\nother.\"\n\n\"Away and about it, then,\" said Etherington. \"But, hark ye, Solmes, be\nkind to her, and see all her wants relieved. I have done her mischief\nenough--though nature and the devil had done half the work to my hand.\"\n\nSolmes at length was permitted to withdraw to execute his various\ncommissions, with an assurance that his services would not be wanted for\nthe next twenty-four hours.\n\n\"Soh!\" said the Earl, as his agent withdrew, \"there is a spring put in\nmotion, which, well oiled, will move the whole machine--And here, in\nlucky time, comes Harry Jekyl--I hear his whistle on the stairs.--There\nis a silly lightness of heart about that fellow, which I envy, while I\ndespise it; but he is welcome now, for I want him.\"\n\nJekyl entered accordingly, and broke out with \"I am glad to see one of\nyour fellows laying a cloth for two in your parlour, Etherington--I was\nafraid you were going down among these confounded bores again to-day.\"\n\n\"_You_ are not to be one of the two, Hal,\" answered Lord Etherington.\n\n\"No?--then I may be a third, I hope, if not second?\"\n\n\"Neither first, second, nor third, Captain.--The truth is, I want a\nt\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate with Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's,\" replied the Earl; \"and,\nbesides, I have to beg the very particular favour of you to go again to\nthat fellow Martigny. It is time that he should produce his papers, if\nhe has any--of which, for one, I do not believe a word. He has had ample\ntime to hear from London; and I think I have delayed long enough in an\nimportant matter upon his bare assertion.\"\n\n\"I cannot blame your impatience,\" said Jekyl, \"and I will go on your\nerrand instantly. As you waited on my advice, I am bound to find an end\nto your suspense.--At the same time, if the man is not possessed of such\npapers as he spoke of, I must own he is happy in a command of consummate\nassurance, which might set up the whole roll of attorneys.\"\n\n\"You will be soon able to judge of that,\" said Lord Etherington; \"and\nnow, off with you--Why do you look at me so anxiously?\"\n\n\"I cannot tell--I have strange forebodings about this t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate with\nMowbray. You should spare him, Etherington--he is not your match--wants\nboth judgment and temper.\"\n\n\"Tell him so, Jekyl,\" answered the Earl, \"and his proud Scotch stomach\nwill be up in an instant, and he will pay you with a shot for your\npains.--Why, he thinks himself cock of the walk, this strutting bantam,\nnotwithstanding the lesson I gave him before--And what do you think?--He\nhas the impudence to talk about my attentions to Lady Binks as\ninconsistent with the prosecution of my suit to his sister! Yes,\nHal--this awkward Scotch laird, that has scarce tact enough to make love\nto a ewe-milker, or, at best, to some daggletailed soubrette, has the\nassurance to start himself as my rival!\"\n\n\"Then, good-night to St. Ronan's!--this will be a fatal dinner to\nhim.--Etherington, I know by that laugh you are bent on mischief--I have\na great mind to give him a hint.\"\n\n\"I wish you would,\" answered the Earl; \"it would all turn to my\naccount.\"\n\n\"Do you defy me?--Well, if I meet him, I will put him on his guard.\"\n\nThe friends parted; and it was not long ere Jekyl encountered Mowbray on\none of the public walks.\n\n\"You dine with Etherington to-day?\" said the Captain--\"Forgive me, Mr.\nMowbray, if I say one single word--Beware.\"\n\n\"Of what should I beware, Captain Jekyl,\" answered Mowbray, \"when I dine\nwith a friend of your own, and a man of honour?\"\n\n\"Certainly Lord Etherington is both, Mr. Mowbray; but he loves play, and\nis too hard for most people.\"\n\n\"I thank you for your hint, Captain Jekyl--I am a raw Scotchman, it is\ntrue; but yet I know a thing or two. Fair play is always presumed\namongst gentlemen; and that taken for granted, I have the vanity to\nthink I need no one's caution on the subject, not even Captain Jekyl's,\nthough his experience must needs be so much superior to mine.\"\n\n\"In that case, sir,\" said Jekyl, bowing coldly, \"I have no more to say,\nand I hope there is no harm done.--Conceited coxcomb!\" he added,\nmentally, as they parted, \"how truly did Etherington judge of him, and\nwhat an ass was I to intermeddle!--I hope Etherington will strip him of\nevery feather!\"\n\nHe pursued his walk in quest of Tyrrel, and Mowbray proceeded to the\napartments of the Earl, in a temper of mind well suited to the purposes\nof the latter, who judged of his disposition accurately when he\npermitted Jekyl to give his well-meant warning. To be supposed, by a man\nof acknowledged fashion, so decidedly inferior to his antagonist--to be\nconsidered as an object of compassion, and made the subject of a\ngood-boy warning, was gall and bitterness to his proud spirit, which,\nthe more that he felt a conscious inferiority in the arts which they all\ncultivated, struggled the more to preserve the footing of at least\napparent equality.\n\nSince the first memorable party at piquet, Mowbray had never hazarded\nhis luck with Lord Etherington, except for trifling stakes; but his\nconceit led him to suppose that he now fully understood his play, and,\nagreeably to the practice of those who have habituated themselves to\ngambling, he had every now and then felt a yearning to try for his\nrevenge. He wished also to be out of Lord Etherington's debt, feeling\ngalled under a sense of pecuniary obligation, which hindered his\nspeaking his mind to him fully upon the subject of his flirtation with\nLady Binks, which he justly considered as an insult to his family,\nconsidering the footing on which the Earl seemed desirous to stand with\nClara Mowbray. From these obligations a favourable evening might free\nhim, and Mowbray was, in fact, indulging in a waking dream to this\npurpose, when Jekyl interrupted him. His untimely warning only excited a\nspirit of contradiction, and a determination to show the adviser how\nlittle he was qualified to judge of his talents; and in this humour,\nhis ruin, which was the consequence of that afternoon, was far from\nseeming to be the premeditated, or even the voluntary work of the Earl\nof Etherington.\n\nOn the contrary, the victim himself was the first to propose play--deep\nplay--double stakes; while Lord Etherington, on the other hand, often\nproposed to diminish their game, or to break off entirely; but it was\nalways with an affectation of superiority which only stimulated Mowbray\nto farther and more desperate risks; and, at last, when Mowbray became\nhis debtor to an overwhelming amount, (his circumstances considered,)\nthe Earl threw down the cards, and declared he should be too late for\nLady Penelope's tea-party, to which he was positively engaged.\n\n\"Will you not give me my revenge?\" said Mowbray, taking up the cards,\nand shuffling them with fierce anxiety.\n\n\"Not now, Mowbray; we have played too long already--you have lost too\nmuch--more than perhaps is convenient for you to pay.\"\n\nMowbray gnashed his teeth, in spite of his resolution to maintain an\nexterior, at least, of firmness.\n\n\"You can take your time, you know,\" said the Earl; \"a note of hand will\nsuit me as well as the money.\"\n\n\"No, by G--!\" answered Mowbray, \"I will not be so taken in a second\ntime--I had better have sold myself to the devil than to your\nlordship--I have never been my own man since.\"\n\n\"These are not very kind expressions, Mowbray,\" said the Earl; \"you\n_would_ play, and they that will play must expect sometimes to lose\"----\n\n\"And they who win will expect to be paid,\" said Mowbray, breaking in. \"I\nknow that as well as you, my lord, and you shall be paid--I will pay\nyou--I will pay you, by G--! Do you make any doubt that I will pay you,\nmy lord?\"\n\n\"You look as if you thought of paying me in sharp coin,\" said Lord\nEtherington; \"and I think that would scarce be consistent with the terms\nwe stand upon towards each other.\"\n\n\"By my soul, my lord,\" said Mowbray, \"I cannot tell what these terms\nare; and to be at my wit's end at once, I should be glad to know. You\nset out upon paying addresses to my sister, and with your visits and\nopportunities at Shaws-Castle, I cannot find the matter makes the least\nprogress--it keeps moving without advancing, like a child's\nrocking-horse. Perhaps you think that you have curbed me up so tightly,\nthat I dare not stir in the matter; but you will find it\notherwise.--Your lordship may keep a haram if you will, but my sister\nshall not enter it.\"\n\n\"You are angry, and therefore you are unjust,\" said Etherington; \"you\nknow well enough it is your sister's fault that there is any delay. I am\nmost willing--most desirous--to call her Lady Etherington--nothing but\nher unlucky prejudices against me have retarded a union which I have so\nmany reasons for desiring.\"\n\n\"Well,\" replied Mowbray, \"that shall be my business. I know no reason\nshe can pretend to decline a marriage so honourable to her house, and\nwhich is approved of by me, that house's head. That matter shall be\narranged in twenty-four hours.\"\n\n\"It will do me the most sensible pleasure,\" said Lord Etherington; \"you\nshall soon see how sincerely I desire your alliance; and as for the\ntrifle you have lost\"----\n\n\"It is no trifle to me, my lord--it is my ruin--but it shall be\npaid--and let me tell your lordship, you may thank your good luck for it\nmore than your good play.\"\n\n\"We will say no more of it at present, if you please,\" said Lord\nEtherington, \"to-morrow is a new day; and if you will take my advice,\nyou will not be too harsh with your sister. A little firmness is seldom\namiss with young women, but severity\"----\n\n\"I will pray your lordship to spare me your advice on this subject.\nHowever valuable it may be in other respects, I can, I take it, speak to\nmy own sister in my own way.\"\n\n\"Since you are so caustically-disposed, Mowbray,\" answered the Earl, \"I\npresume you will not honour her ladyship's tea-table to-night, though I\nbelieve it will be the last of the season?\"\n\n\"And why should you think so, my lord?\" answered Mowbray, whose losses\nhad rendered him testy and contradictory upon every subject that was\nstarted. \"Why should not I pay my respects to Lady Penelope, or any\nother tabby of quality? I have no title, indeed; but I suppose that my\nfamily\"----\n\n\"Entitles you to become a canon of Strasburgh[II-D] doubtless--But you do\nnot seem in a very Christian mood for taking orders. All I meant to say\nwas, that you and Lady Pen were not used to be on such a good footing.\"\n\n\"Well, she sent me a card for her blow-out,\" said Mowbray; \"and so I am\nresolved to go. When I have been there half an hour, I will ride up to\nShaws-Castle, and you shall hear of my speed in wooing for you to-morrow\nmorning.\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV.\n\nA TEA-PARTY.\n\n    Let fall the curtains, wheel the sofa round;\n    And while the bubbling and loud-hissing urn\n    Throws up a steamy column, and the cups\n    That cheer, but not inebriate, wait on each,\n    Thus let us welcome peaceful evening in.\n\nCowper's _Task_.\n\n\nThe approach of the cold and rainy season had now so far thinned the\ncompany at the Well, that, in order to secure the necessary degree of\ncrowd upon her tea-nights, Lady Penelope was obliged to employ some\ncoaxing towards those whom she had considered as much under par in\nsociety. Even the Doctor and Mrs. Blower were graciously smiled\nupon--for their marriage was now an arranged affair; and the event was\nof a nature likely to spread the reputation of the Spa among wealthy\nwidows, and medical gentlemen of more skill than practice. So in they\ncame, the Doctor smirking, gallanting, and performing all the bustling\nparade of settled and arranged courtship, with much of that grace\nwherewith a turkey-cock goes through the same ceremony. Old Touchwood\nhad also attended her ladyship's summons, chiefly, it may be supposed,\nfrom his restless fidgety disposition, which seldom suffered him to\nremain absent even from those places of resort of which he usually\nprofessed his detestation. There was, besides, Mr. Winterblossom, who,\nin his usual spirit of quiet epicurism and self-indulgence, was, under\nthe fire of a volley of compliments to Lady Penelope, scheming to secure\nfor himself an early cup of tea. There was Lady Binks also, with the\nwonted degree of sullenness in her beautiful face, angry at her husband\nas usual, and not disposed to be pleased with Lord Etherington for being\nabsent, when she desired to excite Sir Bingo's jealousy. This she had\ndiscovered to be the most effectual way of tormenting the Baronet, and\nshe rejoiced in it with the savage glee of a hackney coachman, who has\nfound a _raw_, where he can make his poor jade feel the whip. The rest\nof the company were also in attendance as usual. MacTurk himself was\npresent, notwithstanding that he thought it an egregious waste of hot\nwater, to bestow it upon compounding any mixture saving punch. He had of\nlate associated himself a good deal with the traveller; not that they by\nany means resembled each other in temper or opinions, but rather because\nthere was that degree of difference betwixt them which furnished\nperpetual subject for dispute and discussion. They were not long, on the\npresent occasion, ere they lighted on a fertile source of controversy.\n\n\"Never tell me of your points of honour,\" said Touchwood, raising his\nvoice altogether above the general tone of polite conversation--\"all\nhumbug, Captain MacTurk--mere hair-traps to springe woodcocks--men of\nsense break through them.\"\n\n\"Upon my word, sir,\" said the Captain, \"and myself is surprised to hear\nyou--for, look you, sir, every man's honour is the breath of his\nnostrils--Cot tamn!\"\n\n\"Then, let men breathe through their mouths, and be d--d,\" returned the\ncontroversialist. \"I tell you, sir, that, besides its being forbidden,\nboth by law and gospel, it's an idiotical and totally absurd practice,\nthat of duelling. An honest savage has more sense than to practise\nit--he takes his bow or his gun, as the thing may be, and shoots his\nenemy from behind a bush. And a very good way; for you see there can, in\nthat case, be only one man's death between them.\"\n\n\"Saul of my body, sir,\" said the Captain, \"gin ye promulgate sic\ndoctrines amang the good company, it's my belief you will bring somebody\nto the gallows.\"\n\n\"Thank ye, Captain, with all my heart; but I stir up no quarrels--I\nleave war to them that live by it. I only say, that, except our old,\nstupid ancestors in the north-west here, I know no country so silly as\nto harbour this custom of duelling. It is unknown in Africa, among the\nnegroes--in America.\"\n\n\"Don't tell me that,\" said the Captain; \"a Yankee will fight with\nmuskets and buck-shot, rather than sit still with an affront. I should\nknow Jonathan, I think.\"\n\n\"Altogether unknown among the thousand tribes of India.\"\n\n\"I'll be tamned, then!\" said Captain MacTurk. \"Was I not in Tippoo's\nprison at Bangalore? and, when the joyful day of our liberation came,\ndid we not solemnize it with fourteen little affairs, whereof we had\nbeen laying the foundation in our house of captivity, as holy writ has\nit, and never went farther to settle them than the glacis of the fort?\nBy my soul, you would have thought there was a smart skirmish, the\nfiring was so close; and did not I, Captain MacTurk, fight three of them\nmyself, without moving my foot from the place I set it on?\"\n\n\"And pray, sir, what might be the result of this Christian mode of\ngiving thanks for your deliverance?\" demanded Mr. Touchwood.\n\n\"A small list of casualties, after all,\" said the Captain; \"one killed\non the spot, one died of his wounds--two wounded severely--three ditto\nslightly, and little Duncan Macphail reported missing. We were out of\npractice, after such long confinement. So you see how we manage matters\nin India, my dear friend.\"\n\n\"You are to understand,\" replied Touchwood, \"that I spoke only of the\nheathen natives, who, heathen as they are, live in the light of their\nown moral reason, and among whom ye shall therefore see better examples\nof practical morality than among such as yourselves; who, though calling\nyourselves Christians, have no more knowledge of the true acceptation\nand meaning of your religion, than if you had left your Christianity at\nthe Cape of Good Hope, as they say of you, and forgot to take it up when\nyou come back again.\"\n\n\"Py Cot! and I can tell you, sir,\" said the Captain, elevating at once\nhis voice and his nostrils, and snuffing the air with a truculent and\nindignant visage, \"that I will not permit you or any man to throw any\nsuch scandal on my character.--I thank Cot, I can bring good witness\nthat I am as good a Christian as another, for a poor sinner, as the best\nof us are; and I am ready to justify my religion with my sword--Cot\ntamn!--Compare my own self with a parcel of black heathen bodies and\nnatives, that were never in the inner side of a kirk whilst they lived,\nbut go about worshipping stocks and stones, and swinging themselves upon\nbamboos, like peasts, as they are!\"\n\nAn indignant growling in his throat, which sounded like the\nacquiescence of his inward man in the indignant proposition which his\nexternal organs thus expressed, concluded this haughty speech, which,\nhowever, made not the least impression on Touchwood, who cared as little\nfor angry tones and looks as he did for fine speeches. So that it is\nlikely a quarrel between the Christian preceptor and the peacemaker\nmight have occurred for the amusement of the company, had not the\nattention of both, but particularly that of Touchwood, been diverted\nfrom the topic of debate by the entrance of Lord Etherington and\nMowbray.\n\nThe former was, as usual, all grace, smiles, and gentleness. Yet,\ncontrary to his wonted custom, which usually was, after a few general\ncompliments, to attach himself particularly to Lady Binks, the Earl, on\nthe present occasion, avoided the side of the room on which that\nbeautiful but sullen idol held her station, and attached himself\nexclusively to Lady Penelope Penfeather, enduring, without flinching,\nthe strange variety of conceited _bavardage_, which that lady's natural\nparts and acquired information enabled her to pour forth with\nunparalleled profusion.\n\nAn honest heathen, one of Plutarch's heroes, if I mistake not,[II-E]\ndreamed once upon a night, that the figure of Proserpina, whom he had\nlong worshipped, visited his slumbers with an angry and vindictive\ncountenance, and menaced him with vengeance, in resentment of his having\nneglected her altars, with the usual fickleness of a polytheist, for\nthose of some more fashionable divinity. Not that goddess of the\ninfernal regions herself could assume a more haughty or more displeased\ncountenance than that with which Lady Binks looked from time to time\nupon Lord Etherington, as if to warn him of the consequence of this\ndeparture from the allegiance which the young Earl had hitherto\nmanifested towards her, and which seemed now, she knew not why, unless\nit were for the purpose of public insult, to be transferred to her\nrival. Perilous as her eye-glances were, and much as they menaced, Lord\nEtherington felt at this moment the importance of soothing Lady Penelope\nto silence on the subject of the invalid's confession of that morning,\nto be more pressing than that of appeasing the indignation of Lady\nBinks. The former was a case of the most urgent necessity--the latter,\nif he was at all anxious on the subject, might, he perhaps thought, be\ntrusted to time. Had the ladies continued on a tolerable footing\ntogether, he might have endeavoured to conciliate both. But the\nbitterness of their long-suppressed feud had greatly increased, now that\nit was probable the end of the season was to separate them, in all\nlikelihood for ever; so that Lady Penelope had no longer any motive for\ncountenancing Lady Binks, or the lady of Sir Bingo for desiring Lady\nPenelope's countenance. The wealth and lavish expense of the one was no\nlonger to render more illustrious the suit of her right honourable\nfriend, nor was the society of Lady Penelope likely to be soon again\nuseful or necessary to Lady Binks. So that neither were any longer\ndesirous to suppress symptoms of the mutual contempt and dislike which\nthey had long nourished for each other; and whoever should, in this\ndecisive hour, take part with one, had little henceforward to expect\nfrom her rival. What farther and more private reasons Lady Binks might\nhave to resent the defection of Lord Etherington, have never come with\ncertainty to our knowledge; but it was said there had been high words\nbetween them on the floating report that his lordship's visits to\nShaws-Castle were dictated by the wish to find a bride there.\n\nWomen's wits are said to be quick in spying the surest means of avenging\na real or supposed slight. After biting her pretty lips, and revolving\nin her mind the readiest means of vengeance, fate threw in her way young\nMowbray of St. Ronan's. She looked at him, and endeavoured to fix his\nattention with a nod and gracious smile, such as in an ordinary mood\nwould have instantly drawn him to her side. On receiving in answer only\na vacant glance and a bow, she was led to observe him more attentively,\nand was induced to believe, from his wavering look, varying complexion,\nand unsteady step, that he had been drinking unusually deep. Still his\neye was less that of an intoxicated than of a disturbed and desperate\nman, one whose faculties were engrossed by deep and turbid reflection,\nwhich withdrew him from the passing scene.\n\n\"Do you observe how ill Mr. Mowbray looks?\" said she, in a loud\nwhisper; \"I hope he has not heard what Lady Penelope was just now saying\nof his family?\"\n\n\"Unless he hears it from you, my lady,\" answered Mr. Touchwood, who,\nupon Mowbray's entrance, had broken off his discourse with MacTurk, \"I\nthink there is little chance of his learning it from any other person.\"\n\n\"What is the matter?\" said Mowbray, sharply, addressing Chatterly and\nWinterblossom; but the one shrunk nervously from the question,\nprotesting, he indeed had not been precisely attending to what had been\npassing among the ladies, and Winterblossom bowed out of the scrape with\nquiet and cautious politeness--\"he really had not given particular\nattention to what was passing--I was negotiating with Mrs. Jones for an\nadditional lump of sugar to my coffee.--Egad, it was so difficult a\npiece of diplomacy,\" he added, sinking his voice, \"that I have an idea\nher ladyship calculates the West India produce by grains and\npennyweights.\"\n\nThe innuendo, if designed to make Mowbray smile, was far from\nsucceeding. He stepped forward, with more than usual stiffness in his\nair, which was never entirely free from self-consequence, and said to\nLady Binks, \"May I request to know of your ladyship what particular\nrespecting my family had the honour to engage the attention of the\ncompany?\"\n\n\"I was only a listener, Mr. Mowbray,\" returned Lady Binks, with evident\nenjoyment of the rising indignation which she read in his countenance;\n\"not being queen of the night, I am not at all disposed to be answerable\nfor the turn of the conversation.\"\n\nMowbray, in no humour to bear jesting, yet afraid to expose himself by\nfarther enquiry in a company so public, darted a fierce look at Lady\nPenelope, then in close conversation with Lord Etherington,--advanced a\nstep or two towards them,--then, as if checking himself, turned on his\nheel, and left the room. A few minutes afterwards, and when certain\nsatirical nods and winks were circulating among the assembly, a waiter\nslid a piece of paper into Mrs. Jones's hand, who, on looking at the\ncontents, seemed about to leave the room.\n\n\"Jones--Jones!\" exclaimed Lady Penelope, in surprise and displeasure.\n\n\"Only the key of the tea-caddie, your ladyship,\" answered Jones; \"I will\nbe back in an instant.\"\n\n\"Jones--Jones!\" again exclaimed her mistress, \"here is enough\"--of tea,\nshe would have said; but Lord Etherington was so near her, that she was\nashamed to complete the sentence, and had only hope in Jones's quickness\nof apprehension, and the prospect that she would be unable to find the\nkey which she went in search of.\n\nJones, meanwhile, tripped off to a sort of housekeeper's apartment, of\nwhich she was _locum tenens_ for the evening, for the more ready supply\nof whatever might be wanted on Lady Penelope's night, as it was called.\nHere she found Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's, whom she instantly began to\nassail with, \"La! now, Mr. Mowbray, you are such another gentleman!--I\nam sure you will make me lose my place--I'll swear you will--what can\nyou have to say, that you could not as well put off for an hour?\"\n\n\"I want to know, Jones,\" answered Mowbray, in a different tone, perhaps,\nfrom what the damsel expected, \"what your lady was just now saying about\nmy family.\"\n\n\"Pshaw!--was that all?\" answered Mrs. Jones. \"What should she be\nsaying?--nonsense--Who minds what she says?--I am sure I never do, for\none.\"\n\n\"Nay, but, my dear Jones,\" said Mowbray, \"I insist upon knowing--I must\nknow, and I _will_ know.\"\n\n\"La! Mr. Mowbray, why should I make mischief?--As I live, I hear some\none coming! and if you were found speaking with me here--indeed, indeed,\nsome one is coming!\"\n\n\"The devil may come, if he will!\" said Mowbray, \"but we do not part,\npretty mistress, till you tell me what I wish to know.\"\n\n\"Lord, sir, you frighten me!\" answered Jones; \"but all the room heard it\nas well as I--it was about Miss Mowbray--and that my lady would be shy\nof her company hereafter--for that she was--she was\"----\n\n\"For that my sister was _what_?\" said Mowbray, fiercely, seizing her\narm.\n\n\"Lord, sir, you terrify me!\" said Jones, beginning to cry; \"at any rate,\nit was not I that said it--it was Lady Penelope.\"\n\n\"And what was it the old, adder-tongued madwoman dared to say of Clara\nMowbray?--Speak out plainly, and directly, or, by Heaven, I'll make\nyou!\"\n\n\"Hold, sir--hold, for God's sake!--you will break my arm,\" answered the\nterrified handmaiden. \"I am sure I know no harm of Miss Mowbray; only,\nmy lady spoke as if she was no better than she ought to be.--Lord, sir,\nthere is some one listening at the door!\"--and making a spring out of\nhis grasp, she hastened back to the room in which the company were\nassembled.\n\nMowbray stood petrified at the news he had heard, ignorant alike what\ncould be the motive for a calumny so atrocious, and uncertain what he\nwere best do to put a stop to the scandal. To his farther confusion, he\nwas presently convinced of the truth of Mrs. Jones's belief that they\nhad been watched, for, as he went to the door of the apartment, he was\nmet by Mr. Touchwood.\n\n\"What has brought you here, sir?\" said Mowbray, sternly.\n\n\"Hoitie toitie,\" answered the traveller, \"why, how came _you_ here, if\nyou go to that, squire?--Egad, Lady Penelope is trembling for her\nsouchong, so I just took a step here to save her ladyship the trouble of\nlooking after Mrs. Jones in person, which, I think, might have been a\nworse interruption than mine, Mr. Mowbray.\"\n\n\"Pshaw, sir, you talk nonsense,\" said Mowbray; \"the tea-room is so\ninfernally hot, that I had sat down here a moment to draw breath, when\nthe young woman came in.\"\n\n\"And you are going to run away, now the old gentleman is come in?\" said\nTouchwood--\"Come, sir, I am more your friend than you may think.\"\n\n\"Sir, you are intrusive--I want nothing that you can give me,\" said\nMowbray.\n\n\"That is a mistake,\" answered the senior; \"for I can supply you with\nwhat most young men want--money and wisdom.\"\n\n\"You will do well to keep both till they are wanted,\" said Mowbray.\n\n\"Why, so I would, squire, only that I have taken something of a fancy\nfor your family; and they are supposed to have wanted cash and good\ncounsel for two generations, if not for three.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" said Mowbray, angrily, \"you are too old either to play the\nbuffoon, or to get buffoon's payment.\"\n\n\"Which is like monkey's allowance, I suppose,\" said the traveller, \"more\nkicks than halfpence.--Well--at least I am not young enough to quarrel\nwith boys for bullying. I'll convince you, however, Mr. Mowbray, that I\nknow some more of your affairs than what you give me credit for.\"\n\n\"It may be,\" answered Mowbray, \"but you will oblige me more by minding\nyour own.\"\n\n\"Very like; meantime, your losses to-night to my Lord Etherington are no\ntrifle, and no secret neither.\"\n\n\"Mr. Touchwood, I desire to know where you had your information?\" said\nMowbray.\n\n\"A matter of very little consequence compared to its truth or falsehood,\nMr. Mowbray,\" answered the old gentleman.\n\n\"But of the last importance to me, sir,\" said Mowbray. \"In a word, had\nyou such information by or through means of Lord Etherington?--Answer me\nthis single question, and then I shall know better what to think on the\nsubject.\"\n\n\"Upon my honour,\" said Touchwood, \"I neither had my information from\nLord Etherington directly nor indirectly. I say thus much to give you\nsatisfaction, and I now expect you will hear me with patience.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, sir,\" interrupted Mowbray, \"one farther question. I\nunderstand something was said in disparagement of my sister just as I\nentered the tea-room?\"\n\n\"Hem--hem--hem!\" said Touchwood, hesitating. \"I am sorry your ears have\nserved you so well--something there _was_ said lightly, something that\ncan be easily explained, I dare say;--And now, Mr. Mowbray, let me speak\na few serious words with you.\"\n\n\"And now, Mr. Touchwood, we have no more to say to each other--good\nevening to you.\"\n\nHe brushed past the old man, who in vain endeavoured to stop him, and,\nhurrying to the stable, demanded his horse. It was ready saddled, and\nwaited his orders; but even the short time that was necessary to bring\nit to the door of the stable was exasperating to Mowbray's impatience.\nNot less exasperating was the constant interceding voice of Touchwood,\nwho, in tones alternately plaintive and snappish, kept on a string of\nexpostulations.\n\n\"Mr. Mowbray, only five words with you--Mr. Mowbray, you will repent\nthis--Is this a night to ride in, Mr. Mowbray?--My stars, sir, if you\nwould but have five minutes' patience!\"\n\nCurses, not loud but deep, muttered in the throat of the impatient\nlaird, were the only reply, until his horse was brought out, when,\nstaying no farther question, he sprung into the saddle. The poor horse\npaid for the delay, which could not be laid to his charge. Mowbray\nstruck him hard with his spurs so soon as he was in his seat--the noble\nanimal reared, bolted, and sprung forward like a deer, over stock and\nstone, the nearest road--and we are aware it was a rough one--to\nShaws-Castle. There is a sort of instinct by which horses perceive the\nhumour of their riders, and are furious and impetuous, or dull and\nsluggish, as if to correspond with it; and Mowbray's gallant steed\nseemed on this occasion to feel all the stings of his master's internal\nferment, although not again urged with the spur. The ostler stood\nlistening to the clash of the hoofs, succeeding each other in thick and\nclose gallop, until they died away in the distant woodland.\n\n\"If St. Ronan's reach home this night, with his neck unbroken,\" muttered\nthe fellow, \"the devil must have it in keeping.\"\n\n\"Mercy on us!\" said the traveller, \"he rides like a Bedouin Arab! but in\nthe desert there are neither trees to cross the road, nor cleughs, nor\nlinns, nor floods, nor fords. Well, I must set to work myself, or this\ngear will get worse than even I can mend.--Here you, ostler, let me have\nyour best pair of horses instantly to Shaws-Castle.\"\n\n\"To Shaws-Castle, sir?\" said the man, with some surprise.\n\n\"Yes--do you not know such a place?\"\n\n\"In troth, sir, sae few company go there, except on the great ball day,\nthat we have had time to forget the road to it--but St. Ronan's was\nhere even now, sir.\"\n\n\"Ay, what of that?--he has ridden on to get supper ready--so, turn out\nwithout loss of time.\"\n\n\"At your pleasure, sir,\" said the fellow, and called to the postilion\naccordingly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI.\n\nDEBATE.\n\n    _Sedet post equitem atra cura_----\n\n    Still though the headlong cavalier,\n    O'er rough and smooth, in wild career,\n      Seems racing with the wind;\n    His sad companion,--ghastly pale,\n    And darksome as a widow's veil,\n      CARE--keeps her seat behind.\n\nHORACE.\n\n\nWell was it that night for Mowbray, that he had always piqued himself on\nhis horses, and that the animal on which he was then mounted was as\nsure-footed and sagacious as he was mettled and fiery. For those who\nobserved next day the print of the hoofs on the broken and rugged track\nthrough which the creature had been driven at full speed by his furious\nmaster, might easily see, that in more than a dozen of places the horse\nand rider had been within a few inches of destruction. One bough of a\ngnarled and stunted oak-tree, which stretched across the road, seemed in\nparticular to have opposed an almost fatal barrier to the horseman's\ncareer. In striking his head against this impediment, the force of the\nblow had been broken in some measure by a high-crowned hat, yet the\nviolence of the shock was sufficient to shiver the branch to pieces.\nFortunately, it was already decayed; but, even in that state, it was\nsubject of astonishment to every one that no fatal damage had been\nsustained in so formidable an encounter. Mowbray himself was unconscious\nof the accident.\n\nScarcely aware that he had been riding at an unusual rate, scarce\nsensible that he had ridden faster perhaps than ever he followed the\nhounds, Mowbray alighted at his stable door, and flung the bridle to his\ngroom, who held up his hands in astonishment when he beheld the\ncondition of the favourite horse; but, concluding that his master must\nbe intoxicated, he prudently forbore to make any observations.\n\nNo sooner did the unfortunate traveller suspend that rapid motion by\nwhich he seemed to wish to annihilate, as far as possible, time and\nspace, in order to reach the place he had now attained, than it seemed\nto him as if he would have given the world that seas and deserts had\nlain between him and the house of his fathers, as well as that only\nsister with whom he was now about to have a decisive interview.\n\n\"But the place and the hour are arrived,\" he said, biting his lip with\nanguish; \"this explanation must be decisive; and whatever evils may\nattend it, suspense must be ended now, at once and for ever.\"\n\nHe entered the Castle, and took the light from the old domestic, who,\nhearing the clatter of his horse's feet, had opened the door to receive\nhim.\n\n\"Is my sister in her parlour?\" he asked, but in so hollow a voice, that\nthe old man only answered the question by another, \"Was his honour\nwell?\"\n\n\"Quite well, Patrick--never better in my life,\" said Mowbray; and\nturning his back on the old man, as if to prevent his observing whether\nhis countenance and his words corresponded, he pursued his way to his\nsister's apartment. The sound of his step upon the passage roused Clara\nfrom a reverie, perhaps a sad one; and she had trimmed her lamp, and\nstirred her fire, so slow did he walk, before he at length entered her\napartment.\n\n\"You are a good boy, brother,\" she said, \"to come thus early home; and I\nhave some good news for your reward. The groom has fetched back\nTrimmer--He was lying by the dead hare, and he had chased him as far as\nDrumlyford--the shepherd had carried him to the shieling, till some one\nshould claim him.\"\n\n\"I would he had hanged him, with all my heart!\" said Mowbray.\n\n\"How!--hang Trimmer?--your favourite Trimmer, that has beat the whole\ncountry?--and it was only this morning you were half-crying because he\nwas amissing, and like to murder man and mother's son?\"\n\n\"The better I like any living thing,\" answered Mowbray, \"the more reason\nI have for wishing it dead and at rest; for neither I, nor any thing\nthat I love, will ever be happy more.\"\n\n\"You cannot frighten me, John, with these flights,\" answered Clara,\ntrembling, although she endeavoured to look unconcerned--\"You have used\nme to them too often.\"\n\n\"It is well for you then; you will be ruined without the shock of\nsurprise.\"\n\n\"So much the better--We have been,\" said Clara,\n\n    \"'So constantly in poortith's sight,\n    The thoughts on't gie us little fright.'\n\nSo say I with honest Robert Burns.\"\n\n\"D--n Barns and his trash!\" said Mowbray, with the impatience of a man\ndetermined to be angry with every thing but himself, who was the real\nsource of the evil.\n\n\"And why damn poor Burns?\" said Clara, composedly; \"it is not his fault\nif you have not risen a winner, for that, I suppose, is the cause of all\nthis uproar.\"\n\n\"Would it not make any one lose patience,\" said Mowbray, \"to hear her\nquoting the rhapsodies of a hobnail'd peasant, when a man is speaking of\nthe downfall of an ancient house! Your ploughman, I suppose, becoming\none degree poorer than he was born to be, would only go without his\ndinner, or without his usual potation of ale. His comrades would cry\n'poor fellow!' and let him eat out of their kit, and drink out of their\nbicker without scruple, till his own was full again. But the poor\ngentleman--the downfallen man of rank--the degraded man of birth--the\ndisabled and disarmed man of power!--it is he that is to be pitied, who\nloses not merely drink and dinner, but honour, situation, credit,\ncharacter, and name itself!\"\n\n\"You are declaiming in this manner in order to terrify me,\" said Clara:\n\"but, friend John, I know you and your ways, and I have made up my mind\nupon all contingencies that can take place. I will tell you more--I have\nstood on this tottering pinnacle of rank and fashion, if our situation\ncan be termed such, till my head is dizzy with the instability of my\neminence; and I feel that strange desire of tossing myself down, which\nthe devil is said to put into folk's heads when they stand on the top of\nsteeples--at least, I had rather the plunge were over.\"\n\n\"Be satisfied, then; if that will satisfy you--the plunge _is_ over, and\nwe are--what they used to call it in Scotland--gentle beggars--creatures\nto whom our second, and third, and fourth, and fifth cousins may, if\nthey please, give a place at the side-table, and a seat in the carriage\nwith the lady's maid, if driving backwards will not make us sick.\"\n\n\"They may give it to those who will take it,\" said Clara; \"but I am\ndetermined to eat bread of my own buying--I can do twenty things, and I\nam sure some one or other of them will bring me all the little money I\nwill need. I have been trying, John, for several months, how little I\ncan live upon, and you would laugh if you heard how low I have brought\nthe account.\"\n\n\"There is a difference, Clara, between fanciful experiments and real\npoverty--the one is a masquerade, which we can end when we please, the\nother is wretchedness for life.\"\n\n\"Methinks, brother,\" replied Miss Mowbray, \"it would be better for you\nto set me an example how to carry my good resolutions into effect, than\nto ridicule them.\"\n\n\"Why, what would you have me do?\" said he, fiercely--\"turn postilion, or\nrough-rider, or whipper-in?--I don't know any thing else that my\neducation, as I have used it, has fitted me for--and then some of my old\nacquaintances would, I dare say, give me a crown to drink now and then\nfor old acquaintance' sake.\"\n\n\"This is not the way, John, that men of sense think or speak of serious\nmisfortunes,\" answered his sister; \"and I do not believe that this is so\nserious as it is your pleasure to make it.\"\n\n\"Believe the very worst you can think,\" replied he, \"and you will not\nbelieve bad enough!--You have neither a guinea, nor a house, nor a\nfriend;--pass but a day, and it is a chance that you will not have a\nbrother.\"\n\n\"My dear John, you have drunk hard--rode hard.\"\n\n\"Yes--such tidings deserved to be carried express, especially to a young\nlady who receives them so well,\" answered Mowbray, bitterly. \"I suppose,\nnow, it will make no impression, if I were to tell you that you have it\nin your power to stop all this ruin?\"\n\n\"By consummating my own, I suppose?--Brother, I said you could not make\nme tremble, but you have found a way to do it.\"\n\n\"What, you expect I am again to urge you with Lord Etherington's\ncourtship?--That _might_ have saved all, indeed--But that day of grace\nis over.\"\n\n\"I am glad of it, with all my spirit,\" said Clara; \"may it take with it\nall that we can quarrel about!--But till this instant I thought it was\nfor this very point that this long voyage was bound, and that you were\nendeavouring to persuade me of the reality of the danger of the storm,\nin order to reconcile me to the harbour.\"\n\n\"You are mad, I think, in earnest,\" said Mowbray; \"can you really be so\nabsurd as to rejoice that you have no way left to relieve yourself and\nme from ruin, want, and shame?\"\n\n\"From shame, brother?\" said Clara. \"No shame in honest poverty, I hope.\"\n\n\"That is according as folks have used their prosperity, Clara.--I must\nspeak to the point.--There are strange reports going below--By Heaven!\nthey are enough to disturb the ashes of the dead! Were I to mention\nthem, I should expect our poor mother to enter the room--Clara Mowbray,\ncan you guess what I mean?\"\n\nIt was with the utmost exertion, yet in a faltering voice, that she was\nable, after an ineffectual effort, to utter the monosyllable, \"_No!_\"\n\n\"By Heaven! I am ashamed--I am even _afraid_ to express my own\nmeaning!--Clara, what is there which makes you so obstinately reject\nevery proposal of marriage?--Is it that you feel yourself unworthy to be\nthe wife of an honest man?--Speak out!--Evil Fame has been busy with\nyour reputation--speak out!--Give me the right to cram their lies down\nthe throats of the inventors, and when I go among them to-morrow, I\nshall know how to treat those who cast reflections on you! The fortunes\nof our house are ruined, but no tongue shall slander its\nhonour.--Speak--speak, wretched girl! why are you silent?\"\n\n\"Stay at home, brother!\" said Clara; \"stay at home, if you regard our\nhouse's honour--murder cannot mend misery--Stay at home, and let them\ntalk of me as they will,--they can scarcely say worse of me than I\ndeserve!\"[II-F]\n\nThe passions of Mowbray, at all times ungovernably strong, were at\npresent inflamed by wine, by his rapid journey, and the previously\ndisturbed state of his mind. He set his teeth, clenched his hands,\nlooked on the ground, as one that forms some horrid resolution, and\nmuttered almost unintelligibly, \"It were charity to kill her!\"\n\n\"Oh! no--no--no!\" exclaimed the terrified girl, throwing herself at his\nfeet; \"Do not kill me, brother! I have wished for death--thought of\ndeath--prayed for death--but, oh! it is frightful to think that he is\nnear--Oh! not a bloody death, brother, nor by your hand!\"\n\nShe held him close by the knees as she spoke, and expressed, in her\nlooks and accents, the utmost terror. It was not, indeed, without\nreason; for the extreme solitude of the place, the violent and inflamed\npassions of her brother, and the desperate circumstances to which he had\nreduced himself, seemed all to concur to render some horrid act of\nviolence not an improbable termination of this strange interview.\n\nMowbray folded his arms, without unclenching his hands, or raising his\nhead, while his sister continued on the floor, clasping him round the\nknees with all her strength, and begging piteously for her life and for\nmercy.\n\n\"Fool!\" he said, at last, \"let me go!--Who cares for thy worthless\nlife?--who cares if thou live or die? Live, if thou canst--and be the\nhate and scorn of every one else, as much as thou art mine!\"\n\nHe grasped her by the shoulder, with one hand pushed her from him, and,\nas she arose from the floor, and again pressed to throw her arms around\nhis neck, he repulsed her with his arm and hand, with a push--or\nblow--it might be termed either one or the other,--violent enough, in\nher weak state, to have again extended her on the ground, had not a\nchair received her as she fell. He looked at her with ferocity, grappled\na moment in his pocket; then ran to the window, and throwing the sash\nviolently up, thrust himself as far as he could without falling, into\nthe open air. Terrified, and yet her feelings of his unkindness\npredominating even above her fears, Clara continued to exclaim.\n\n\"Oh, brother, say you did not mean this!--Oh, say you did not mean to\nstrike me!--Oh, whatever I have deserved, be not you the\nexecutioner!--It is not manly--it is not natural--there are but two of\nus in the world!\"\n\nHe returned no answer; and, observing that he continued to stretch\nhimself from the window, which was in the second story of the building,\nand overlooked the court, a new cause of apprehension mingled, in some\nmeasure, with her personal fears. Timidly, and with streaming eyes and\nuplifted hands, she approached her angry brother, and, fearfully, yet\nfirmly, seized the skirt of his coat, as if anxious to preserve him from\nthe effects of that despair, which so lately seemed turned against her,\nand now against himself.\n\nHe felt the pressure of her hold, and drawing himself angrily back,\nasked her sternly what she wanted.\n\n\"Nothing,\" she said, quitting her hold of his coat; \"but what--what did\nhe look after so anxiously?\"\n\n\"After the devil!\" he answered, fiercely; then drawing in his head, and\ntaking her hand, \"By my soul, Clara--it is true, if ever there was truth\nin such a tale!--He stood by me just now, and urged me to murder\nthee!--What else could have put my hunting-knife into my thought?--Ay,\nby God, and into my very hand--at such a moment?--Yonder I could almost\nfancy I see him fly, the wood, and the rock, and the water, gleaming\nback the dark-red furnace-light, that is shed on them by his dragon\nwings! By my soul, I can hardly suppose it fancy--I can hardly think but\nthat I was under the influence of an evil spirit--under an act of\nfiendish possession! But gone as he is, gone let him be--and thou, too\nready implement of evil, be thou gone after him!\" He drew from his\npocket his right hand, which had all this time held his hunting-knife,\nand threw the implement into the court-yard as he spoke, then, with a\nsad quietness, and solemnity of manner, shut the window, and led his\nsister by the hand to her usual seat, which her tottering steps scarce\nenabled her to reach. \"Clara,\" he said, after a pause of mournful\nsilence, \"we must think what is to be done, without passion or\nviolence--there may be something for us in the dice yet, if we do not\nthrow away our game. A blot is never a blot till it is hit--dishonour\nconcealed, is not dishonour in some respects.--Dost thou attend to me,\nwretched girl?\" he said, suddenly and sternly raising his voice.\n\n\"Yes, brother--yes, indeed, brother!\" she hastily replied, terrified\neven by delay again to awaken his ferocious and ungovernable temper.\n\n\"Thus it must be, then,\" he said. \"You must marry this\nEtherington--there is no help for it, Clara--You cannot complain of what\nyour own vice and folly have rendered inevitable.\"\n\n\"But, brother!\"--said the trembling girl.\n\n\"Be silent. I know all that you would say. You love him not, you would\nsay. I love him not, no more than you. Nay, what is more, he loves you\nnot; if he did, I might scruple to give you to him, you being such as\nyou have owned yourself. But you shall wed him out of hate, Clara--or\nfor the interest of your family--or for what reason you will--But wed\nhim you shall and must.\"\n\n\"Brother--dearest brother--one single word!\"\n\n\"Not of refusal or expostulation--that time is gone by,\" said her stern\ncensurer. \"When I believed thee what I thought thee this morning, I\nmight advise you, but I could not compel. But, since the honour of our\nfamily has been disgraced by your means, it is but just, that, if\npossible, its disgrace should be hidden; and it shall,--ay, if selling\nyou for a slave would tend to conceal it!\"\n\n\"You do worse--you do worse by me! A slave in an open market may be\nbought by a kind master--you do not give me that chance--you wed me to\none who\"----\n\n\"Fear him not, nor the worst that he can do, Clara,\" said her brother.\n\"I know on what terms he marries; and being once more your brother, as\nyour obedience in this matter will make me, he had better tear his flesh\nfrom his bones with his own teeth, than do thee any displeasure! By\nHeaven, I hate him so much--for he has outreached me every way--that\nmethinks it is some consolation that he will not receive in thee the\nexcellent creature I thought thee!--Fallen as thou art, thou art still\ntoo good for him.\"\n\nEncouraged by the more gentle and almost affectionate tone in which her\nbrother spoke, Clara could not help saying, although almost in a\nwhisper, \"I trust it will not be so--I trust he will consider his own\ncondition, honour, and happiness, better than to share it with me.\"\n\n\"Let him utter such a scruple if he dares,\" said Mowbray--\"But he dares\nnot hesitate--he knows that the instant he recedes from addressing you,\nhe signs his own death-warrant or mine, or perhaps that of both; and his\nviews, too, are of a kind that will not be relinquished on a point of\nscrupulous delicacy merely. Therefore, Clara, nourish no such thought\nin your heart as that there is the least possibility of your escaping\nthis marriage! The match is booked--Swear you will not hesitate.\"\n\n\"I will not,\" she said, almost breathlessly, terrified lest he was about\nto start once more into the fit of unbridled fury which had before\nseized on him.\n\n\"Do not even whisper or hint an objection, but submit to your fate, for\nit is inevitable.\"\n\n\"I will--submit\"--answered Clara, in the same trembling accent.\n\n\"And I,\" he said, \"will spare you--at least at present--and it may be\nfor ever--all enquiry into the guilt which you have confessed. Rumours\nthere were of misconduct, which reached my ears even in England; but who\ncould have believed them that looked on you daily, and witnessed your\nlate course of life?--On this subject I will be at present\nsilent--perhaps may not again touch on it--that is, if you do nothing to\nthwart my pleasure, or to avoid the fate which circumstances render\nunavoidable.--And now it is late--retire, Clara, to your bed--think on\nwhat I have said as what necessity has determined, and not my selfish\npleasure.\"\n\nHe held out his hand, and she placed, but not without reluctant terror,\nher trembling palm in his. In this manner, and with a sort of mournful\nsolemnity, as if they had been in attendance upon a funeral, he handed\nhis sister through a gallery hung with old family pictures, at the end\nof which was Clara's bedchamber. The moon, which at this moment looked\nout through a huge volume of mustering clouds that had long been boding\nstorm, fell on the two last descendants of that ancient family, as they\nglided hand in hand, more like the ghosts of the deceased than like\nliving persons, through the hall and amongst the portraits of their\nforefathers. The same thoughts were in the breast of both, but neither\nattempted to say, while they cast a flitting glance on the pallid and\ndecayed representations, \"How little did these anticipate this\ncatastrophe of their house!\" At the door of the bedroom Mowbray quitted\nhis sister's hand, and said, \"Clara, you should to-night thank God, that\nsaved you from a great danger, and me from a deadly sin.\"\n\n\"I will,\" she answered--\"I will.\" And, as if her terror had been anew\nexcited by this allusion to what had passed, she bid her brother hastily\ngood-night, and was no sooner within her apartment, than he heard her\nturn the key in the lock, and draw two bolts besides.\n\n\"I understand you, Clara,\" muttered Mowbray between his teeth, as he\nheard one bar drawn after another. \"But if you could earth yourself\nunder Ben Nevis, you could not escape what fate has destined for\nyou.--Yes!\" he said to himself, as he walked with slow and moody pace\nthrough the moonlight gallery, uncertain whether to return to the\nparlour, or to retire to his solitary chamber, when his attention was\nroused by a noise in the court-yard.\n\nThe night was not indeed very far advanced, but it had been so long\nsince Shaws-Castle received a guest, that had Mowbray not heard the\nrolling of wheels in the court-yard, he might have thought rather of\nhousebreakers than of visitors. But, as the sound of a carriage and\nhorses was distinctly heard, it instantly occurred to him, that the\nguest must be Lord Etherington, come, even at this late hour, to speak\nwith him on the reports which were current to his sister's prejudice,\nand perhaps to declare his addresses to her were at an end. Eager to\nknow the worst, and to bring matters to a decision, he re-entered the\napartment he had just left, where the lights were still burning, and,\ncalling loudly to Patrick, whom he heard in communing with the\npostilion, commanded him to show the visitor to Miss Mowbray's parlour.\nIt was not the light step of the young nobleman which came tramping, or\nrather stamping, through the long passage, and up the two or three steps\nat the end of it. Neither was it Lord Etherington's graceful figure\nwhich was seen when the door opened, but the stout square substance of\nMr. Peregrine Touchwood.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII.\n\nA RELATIVE.\n\n    Claim'd kindred there, and had his claims allow'd.\n\n_Deserted Village._\n\n\nStarting at the unexpected and undesired apparition which presented\nitself, in the manner described at the end of the last chapter, Mowbray\nyet felt, at the same time, a kind of relief, that his meeting with Lord\nEtherington, painfully decisive as that meeting must be, was for a time\nsuspended. So it was with a mixture of peevishness and internal\nsatisfaction, that he demanded what had procured him the honour of a\nvisit from Mr. Touchwood at this late hour.\n\n\"Necessity, that makes the old wife trot,\" replied Touchwood; \"no choice\nof mine, I assure you--Gad, Mr. Mowbray, I would rather have crossed\nSaint Gothard, than run the risk I have done to-night, rumbling through\nyour breakneck roads in that d----d old wheelbarrow.--On my word, I\nbelieve I must be troublesome to your butler for a draught of\nsomething--I am as thirsty as a coal-heaver that is working by the\npiece. You have porter, I suppose, or good old Scotch two-penny?\"\n\nWith a secret execration on his visitor's effrontery, Mr. Mowbray\nordered the servant to put down wine and water, of which Touchwood\nmixed a gobletful, and drank it off.\n\n\"We are a small family,\" said his entertainer; \"and I am seldom at\nhome--still more seldom receive guests, when I chance to be here--I am\nsorry I have no malt liquor, if you prefer it.\"\n\n\"Prefer it?\" said Touchwood, compounding, however, another glass of\nsherry and water, and adding a large piece of sugar, to correct the\nhoarseness which, he observed, his night journey might bring on,--\"to be\nsure I prefer it, and so does every body, except Frenchmen and\ndandies.--No offence, Mr. Mowbray, but you should order a hogshead from\nMeux--the brown-stout, wired down for exportation to the colonies, keeps\nfor any length of time, and in every climate--I have drank it where it\nmust have cost a guinea a quart, if interest had been counted.\"\n\n\"When I _expect_ the honour of a visit from you, Mr. Touchwood, I will\nendeavour to be better provided,\" answered Mowbray; \"at present your\narrival has been without notice, and I would be glad to know if it has\nany particular object.\"\n\n\"This is what I call coming to the point,\" said Mr. Touchwood, thrusting\nout his stout legs, accoutred as they were with the ancient defences,\ncalled boot-hose, so as to rest his heels upon the fender. \"Upon my\nlife, the fire turns the best flower in the garden at this season of the\nyear--I'll take the freedom to throw on a log.--Is it not a strange\nthing, by the by, that one never sees a fagot in Scotland? You have much\nsmall wood, Mr. Mowbray, I wonder you do not get some fellow from the\nmidland counties, to teach your people how to make a fagot.\"\n\n\"Did you come all the way to Shaws-Castle,\" asked Mowbray, rather\ntestily, \"to instruct me in the mystery of fagot-making?\"\n\n\"Not exactly--not exactly,\" answered the undaunted Touchwood; \"but there\nis a right and a wrong way in every thing--a word by the way, on any\nuseful subject, can never fall amiss.--As for my immediate and more\npressing business, I can assure you, that it is of a nature sufficiently\nurgent, since it brings me to a house in which I am much surprised to\nfind myself.\"\n\n\"The surprise is mutual, sir,\" said Mowbray, gravely, observing that his\nguest made a pause; \"it is full time you should explain it.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" replied Touchwood; \"I must first ask you whether you have\nnever heard of a certain old gentleman, called Scrogie, who took it into\nwhat he called his head, poor man, to be ashamed of the name he bore,\nthough owned by many honest and respectable men, and chose to join it to\nyour surname of Mowbray, as having a more chivalrous Norman sounding,\nand, in a word, a gentlemanlike twang with it?\"\n\n\"I have heard of such a person, though only lately,\" said Mowbray.\n\"Reginald Scrogie Mowbray was his name. I have reason to consider his\nalliance with my family as undoubted, though you seem to mention it with\na sneer, sir. I believe Mr. S. Mowbray regulated his family settlements\nvery much upon the idea that his heir was to intermarry with our house.\"\n\n\"True, true, Mr. Mowbray,\" answered Touchwood; \"and certainly it is not\nyour business to lay the axe to the root of the genealogical tree, that\nis like to bear golden apples for you--Ha!\"\n\n\"Well, well, sir--proceed--proceed,\" answered Mowbray.\n\n\"You may also have heard that this old gentleman had a son, who would\nwillingly have cut up the said family-tree into fagots; who thought\nScrogie sounded as well as Mowbray, and had no fancy for an imaginary\ngentility, which was to be attained by the change of one's natural name,\nand the disowning, as it were, of one's actual relations.\"\n\n\"I think I have heard from Lord Etherington,\" answered Mowbray, \"to\nwhose communications I owe most of my knowledge about these Scrogie\npeople, that old Mr. Scrogie Mowbray was unfortunate in a son, who\nthwarted his father on every occasion,--would embrace no opportunity\nwhich fortunate chances held out, of raising and distinguishing the\nfamily,--had imbibed low tastes, wandering habits, and singular objects\nof pursuit,--on account of which his father disinherited him.\"\n\n\"It is very true, Mr. Mowbray,\" proceeded Touchwood, \"that this person\ndid happen to fall under his father's displeasure, because he scorned\nforms and flummery,--loved better to make money as an honest merchant,\nthan to throw it away as an idle gentleman,--never called a coach when\nwalking on foot would serve the turn,--and liked the Royal Exchange\nbetter than St. James's Park. In short, his father disinherited him,\nbecause he had the qualities for doubling the estate, rather than those\nfor squandering it.\"\n\n\"All this may be quite correct, Mr. Touchwood,\" replied Mowbray; \"but\npray, what has this Mr. Scrogie, junior, to do with you or me?\"\n\n\"Do with you or me!\" said Touchwood, as if surprised at the question;\n\"he has a great deal to do with me at least, since I am the very man\nmyself.\"\n\n\"The devil you are!\" said Mowbray, opening wide his eyes in turn; \"Why,\nMr. A--a--your name is Touchwood--P. Touchwood--Paul, I suppose, or\nPeter--I read it so in the subscription book at the Well.\"\n\n\"Peregrine, sir, Peregrine--my mother would have me so christened,\nbecause Peregrine Pickle came out during her confinement; and my poor\nfoolish father acquiesced, because he thought it genteel, and derived\nfrom the Willoughbies. I don't like it, and I always write P. short, and\nyou might have remarked an S. also before the surname--I use at present\nP. S. Touchwood. I had an old acquaintance in the city, who loved his\njest--He always called me Postscript Touchwood.\"\n\n\"Then, sir,\" said Mowbray, \"if you are really Mr. Scrogie, _tout court_,\nI must suppose the name of Touchwood is assumed?\"\n\n\"What the devil!\" replied Mr. P. S. Touchwood, \"do you suppose there is\nno name in the English nation will couple up legitimately with my\npaternal name of Scrogie, except your own, Mr. Mowbray?--I assure you I\ngot the name of Touchwood, and a pretty spell of money along with it,\nfrom an old godfather, who admired my spirit in sticking by commerce.\"\n\n\"Well, sir, every one has his taste--Many would have thought it better\nto enjoy a hereditary estate, by keeping your father's name of Mowbray,\nthan to have gained another by assuming a stranger's name of Touchwood.\"\n\n\"Who told you Mr. Touchwood was a stranger to me?\" said the traveller;\n\"for aught I know, he had a better title to the duties of a son from\nme, than the poor old man who made such a fool of himself, by trying to\nturn gentleman in his old age. He was my grandfather's partner in the\ngreat firm of Touchwood, Scrogie, and Co.--Let me tell you, there is as\ngood inheritance in house as in field--a man's partners are his fathers\nand brothers, and a head clerk may be likened to a kind of first\ncousin.\"\n\n\"I meant no offence whatever, Mr. Touchwood Scrogie.\"\n\n\"Scrogie Touchwood, if you please,\" said the senior; \"the scrog branch\nfirst, for it must become rotten ere it become touchwood--ha, ha,\nha!--you take me.\"\n\n\"A singular old fellow this,\" said Mowbray to himself, \"and speaks in\nall the dignity of dollars; but I will be civil to him, till I can see\nwhat he is driving at.--You are facetious, Mr. Touchwood,\" he proceeded\naloud. \"I was only going to say, that although you set no value upon\nyour connexion with my family, yet I cannot forget that such a\ncircumstance exists; and therefore I bid you heartily welcome to\nShaws-Castle.\"\n\n\"Thank ye, thank ye, Mr. Mowbray--I knew you would see the thing right.\nTo tell you the truth, I should not have cared much to come a-begging\nfor your acquaintance and cousinship, and so forth; but that I thought\nyou would be more tractable in your adversity, than was your father in\nhis prosperity.\"\n\n\"Did you know my father, sir?\" said Mowbray.\n\n\"Ay, ay--I came once down here, and was introduced to him--saw your\nsister and you when you were children--had thoughts of making my will\nthen, and should have clapped you both in before I set out to double\nCape Horn. But, gad, I wish my poor father had seen the reception I got!\nI did not let the old gentleman, Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's that was\nthen, smoke my money-bags--that might have made him more tractable--not\nbut that we went on indifferent well for a day or two, till I got a hint\nthat my room was wanted, for that the Duke of Devil-knows-what was\nexpected, and my bed was to serve his valet-de-chambre.--'Oh, damn all\ngentle cousins!' said I, and off I set on the pad round the world again,\nand thought no more of the Mowbrays till a year or so ago.\"\n\n\"And, pray, what recalled us to your recollection?\"\n\n\"Why,\" said Touchwood, \"I was settled for some time at Smyrna, (for I\nturn the penny go where I will--I have done a little business even since\nI came here;)--but being at Smyrna as I said, I became acquainted with\nFrancis Tyrrel.\"\n\n\"The natural brother of Lord Etherington,\" said Mowbray.\n\n\"Ay, so called,\" answered Touchwood; \"but by and by he is more likely to\nprove the Earl of Etherington himself, and t'other fine fellow the\nbastard.\"\n\n\"The devil he is!--You surprise me, Mr. Touchwood.\"\n\n\"I thought I should--I thought I should--Faith, I am sometimes surprised\nmyself at the turn things take in this world. But the thing is not the\nless certain--the proofs are lying in the strong chest of our house at\nLondon, deposited there by the old Earl, who repented of his roguery to\nMiss Martigny long before he died, but had not courage enough to do his\nlegitimate son justice till the sexton had housed him.\"\n\n\"Good Heaven, sir!\" said Mowbray; \"and did you know all this while, that\nI was about to bestow the only sister of my house upon an impostor?\"\n\n\"What was my business with that, Mr. Mowbray?\" replied Touchwood; \"you\nwould have been very angry had any one suspected you of not being sharp\nenough to look out for yourself and your sister both. Besides, Lord\nEtherington, bad enough as he may be in other respects, was, till very\nlately, no impostor, or an innocent one, for he only occupied the\nsituation in which his father had placed him. And, indeed, when I\nunderstood, upon coming to England, that he was gone down here, and, as\nI conjectured, to pay his addresses to your sister, to say truth, I did\nnot see he could do better. Here was a poor fellow that was about to\ncease to be a lord and a wealthy man; was it not very reasonable that he\nshould make the most of his dignity while he had it? and if, by marrying\na pretty girl while in possession of his title, he could get possession\nof the good estate of Nettlewood, why, I could see nothing in it but a\nvery pretty way of breaking his fall.\"\n\n\"Very pretty for him, indeed, and very convenient too,\" said Mowbray;\n\"but pray, sir, what was to become of the honour of my family?\"\n\n\"Why, what was the honour of your family to me?\" said Touchwood; \"unless\nit was to recommend your family to my care, that I was disinherited on\naccount of it. And if this Etherington, or Bulmer, had been a good\nfellow, I would have seen all the Mowbrays that ever wore broad cloth at\nJericho, before I had interfered.\"\n\n\"I am really much indebted to your kindness,\" said Mowbray angrily.\n\n\"More than you are aware of,\" answered Touchwood; \"for, though I thought\nthis Bulmer, even when declared illegitimate, might be a reasonable good\nmatch for your sister, considering the estate which was to accompany the\nunion of their hands; yet, now I have discovered him to be a\nscoundrel--every way a scoundrel--I would not wish any decent girl to\nmarry him, were they to get all Yorkshire, instead of Nettlewood. So I\nhave come to put you right.\"\n\nThe strangeness of the news which Touchwood so bluntly communicated,\nmade Mowbray's head turn round like that of a man who grows dizzy at\nfinding himself on the verge of a precipice. Touchwood observed his\nconsternation, which he willingly construed into an acknowledgment of\nhis own brilliant genius.\n\n\"Take a glass of wine, Mr. Mowbray,\" he said, complacently; \"take a\nglass of old sherry--nothing like it for clearing the ideas--and do not\nbe afraid of me, though I come thus suddenly upon you with such\nsurprising tidings--you will find me a plain, simple, ordinary man, that\nhave my faults and my blunders like other people. I acknowledge that\nmuch travel and experience have made me sometimes play the busybody,\nbecause I find I can do things better than other people, and I love to\nsee folk stare--it's a way I have got. But, after all, I am _un bon\ndiable_, as the Frenchman says; and here I have come four or five\nhundred miles to lie quiet among you all, and put all your little\nmatters to rights, just when you think they are most desperate.\"\n\n\"I thank you for your good intentions,\" said Mowbray; \"but I must needs\nsay, that they would have been more effectual had you been less cunning\nin my behalf, and frankly told me what you knew of Lord Etherington; as\nit is, the matter has gone fearfully far. I have promised him my\nsister--I have laid myself under personal obligations to him--and there\nare other reasons why I fear I must keep my word to this man, earl or no\nearl.\"\n\n\"What!\" exclaimed Touchwood, \"would you give up your sister to a\nworthless rascal, who is capable of robbing the post-office, and of\nmurdering his brother, because you have lost a trifle of money to him?\nAre you to let him go off triumphantly, because he is a gamester as well\nas a cheat?--You are a pretty fellow, Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's--you\nare one of the happy sheep that go out for wool, and come home shorn.\nEgad, you think yourself a millstone, and turn out a sack of grain--You\nflew abroad a hawk, and have come home a pigeon--You snarled at the\nPhilistines, and they have drawn your eye-teeth with a vengeance!\"\n\n\"This is all very witty, Mr. Touchwood,\" replied Mowbray; \"but wit will\nnot pay this man Etherington, or whatever he is, so many hundreds as I\nhave lost to him.\"\n\n\"Why, then, wealth must do what wit cannot,\" said old Touchwood; \"I must\nadvance for you, that is all. Look ye, sir, I do not go afoot for\nnothing--if I have laboured, I have reaped--and, like the fellow in the\nold play, 'I have enough, and can maintain my humour'--it is not a few\nhundreds, or thousands either, can stand betwixt old P. S. Touchwood and\nhis purpose; and my present purpose is to make you, Mr. Mowbray of St.\nRonan's, a free man of the forest.--You still look grave on it, young\nman?--Why, I trust you are not such an ass as to think your dignity\noffended, because the plebeian Scrogie comes to the assistance of the\nterribly great and old house of Mowbray?\"\n\n\"I am indeed not such a fool,\" answered Mowbray, with his eyes still\nbent on the ground, \"to reject assistance that comes to me like a rope\nto a drowning man--but there is a circumstance\"----he stopped short and\ndrank a glass of wine--\"a circumstance to which it is most painful to me\nto allude--but you seem my friend--and I cannot intimate to you more\nstrongly my belief in your professions of regard than by saying, that\nthe language held by Lady Penelope Penfeather on my sister's account,\nrenders it highly proper that she were settled in life; and I cannot but\nfear, that the breaking off the affair with this man might be of great\nprejudice to her at this moment. They will have Nettlewood, and they may\nlive separate--he has offered to make settlements to that effect, even\non the very day of marriage. Her condition as a married woman will put\nher above scandal, and above necessity, from which, I am sorry to say, I\ncannot hope long to preserve her.\"\n\n\"For shame!--for shame!--for shame!\" said Touchwood, accumulating his\nwords thicker than usual on each other; \"would you sell your own flesh\nand blood to a man like this Bulmer, whose character is now laid before\nyou, merely because a disappointed old maid speaks scandal of her? A\nfine veneration you pay to the honoured name of Mowbray! If my poor,\nold, simple father had known what the owners of these two grand\nsyllables could have stooped to do for merely ensuring subsistence, he\nwould have thought as little of the noble Mowbrays as of the humble\nScrogies. And, I dare say, the young lady is just such another--eager\nto get married--no matter to whom.\"\n\n\"Excuse me, Mr. Touchwood,\" answered Mowbray; \"my sister entertains\nsentiments so very different from what you ascribe to her, that she and\nI parted on the most unpleasant terms, in consequence of my pressing\nthis man's suit upon her. God knows, that I only did so, because I saw\nno other outlet from this most unpleasant dilemma. But, since you are\nwilling to interfere, sir, and aid me to disentangle these complicated\nmatters, which have, I own, been made worse by my own rashness, I am\nready to throw the matter completely into your hands, just as if you\nwere my father arisen from the dead. Nevertheless, I must needs express\nmy surprise at the extent of your intelligence in these affairs.\"\n\n\"You speak very sensibly, young man,\" said the traveller; \"and as for my\nintelligence, I have for some time known the finesses of this Master\nBulmer as perfectly as if I had been at his elbow when he was playing\nall his dog's tricks with this family. You would hardly suspect now,\" he\ncontinued, in a confidential tone, \"that what you were so desirous a\nwhile ago should take place, has in some sense actually happened, and\nthat the marriage ceremony has really passed betwixt your sister and\nthis pretended Lord Etherington?\"\n\n\"Have a care, sir!\" said Mowbray, fiercely; \"do not abuse my\ncandour--this is no place, time, or subject, for impertinent jesting.\"\n\n\"As I live by bread, I am serious,\" said Touchwood; \"Mr. Cargill\nperformed the ceremony; and there are two living witnesses who heard\nthem say the words, 'I, Clara, take you, Francis,' or whatever the\nScottish church puts in place of that mystical formula.\"\n\n\"It is impossible,\" said Mowbray; \"Cargill dared not have done such a\nthing--a clandestine proceeding, such as you speak of, would have cost\nhim his living. I'll bet my soul against a horse-shoe, it is all an\nimposition; and you come to disturb me, sir, amid my family distress,\nwith legends that have no more truth in them than the Alkoran.\"\n\n\"There are some true things in the Alkoran, (or rather, the Koran, for\nthe Al is merely the article prefixed,) but let that pass--I will raise\nyour wonder higher before I am done. It is very true, that your sister\nwas indeed joined in marriage with this same Bulmer, that calls himself\nby the title of Etherington; but it is just as true, that the marriage\nis not worth a maravedi, for she believed him at the time to be another\nperson--to be, in a word, Francis Tyrrel, who is actually what the other\npretends to be, a nobleman of fortune.\"\n\n\"I cannot understand one word of all this,\" said Mowbray. \"I must to my\nsister instantly, and demand of her if there be any real foundation for\nthese wonderful averments.\"\n\n\"Do not go,\" said Touchwood, detaining him, \"you shall have a full\nexplanation from me; and to comfort you under your perplexity, I can\nassure you that Cargill's consent to celebrate the nuptials, was only\nobtained by an aspersion thrown on your sister's character, which\ninduced him to believe that speedy marriage would be the sole means of\nsaving her reputation; and I am convinced in my own mind it is only the\nrevival of this report which has furnished the foundation of Lady\nPenelope's chattering.\"\n\n\"If I could think so\"--said Mowbray, \"if I could but think this is\ntruth--and it seems to explain, in some degree, my sister's mysterious\nconduct--if I could but think it true, I should fall down and worship\nyou as an angel from heaven!\"\n\n\"A proper sort of angel,\" said Touchwood, looking modestly down on his\nshort, sturdy supporters--\"Did you ever hear of an angel in boot-hose?\nOr, do you suppose angels are sent to wait on broken-down\nhorse-jockeys?\"\n\n\"Call me what you will, Mr. Touchwood,\" said the young man, \"only make\nout your story true, and my sister innocent!\"\n\n\"Very well spoken, sir,\" answered the senior, \"very well spoken! But\nthen I understand, you are to be guided by my prudence and experience?\nNone of your G-- damme doings, sir--your duels or your drubbings. Let\n_me_ manage the affair for you, and I will bring you through with a\nflowing sail.\"\n\n\"Sir, I must feel as a gentleman,\"--said Mowbray.\n\n\"Feel as a fool,\" said Touchwood, \"for that is the true case. Nothing\nwould please this Bulmer better than to fight through his rogueries--he\nknows very well, that he who can slit a pistol-ball on the edge of a\npenknife, will always preserve some sort of reputation amidst his\nscoundrelism--but I shall take care to stop that hole. Sit down--be a\nman of sense, and listen to the whole of this strange story.\"\n\nMowbray sat down accordingly; and Touchwood, in his own way, and with\nmany characteristic interjectional remarks, gave him an account of the\nearly loves of Clara and Tyrrel--of the reasons which induced Bulmer at\nfirst to encourage their correspondence, in hopes that his brother\nwould, by a clandestine marriage, altogether ruin himself with his\nfather--of the change which took place in his views when he perceived\nthe importance annexed by the old Earl to the union of Miss Mowbray with\nhis apparent heir--of the desperate stratagem which he endeavoured to\nplay off, by substituting himself in the room of his brother--and all\nthe consequences, which it is unnecessary to resume here, as they are\ndetailed at length by the perpetrator himself, in his correspondence\nwith Captain Jekyl.\n\nWhen the whole communication was ended, Mowbray, almost stupified by the\nwonders he had heard, remained for some time in a sort of reverie, from\nwhich he only started to ask what evidence could be produced of a story\nso strange.\n\n\"The evidence,\" answered Touchwood, \"of one who was a deep agent in all\nthese matters, from first to last--as complete a rogue, I believe, as\nthe devil himself, with this difference, that our mortal fiend does not,\nI believe, do evil for the sake of evil, but for the sake of the profit\nwhich attends it. How far this plea will avail him in a court of\nconscience, I cannot tell; but his disposition was so far akin to\nhumanity, that I have always found my old acquaintance as ready to do\ngood as harm, providing he had the same _agio_ upon the transaction.\"\n\n\"On my soul,\" said Mowbray, \"you must mean Solmes! whom I have long\nsuspected to be a deep villain--and now he proves traitor to boot. How\nthe devil could you get into his intimacy, Mr. Touchwood?\"\n\n\"The case was particular,\" said Touchwood. \"Mr. Solmes, too active a\nmember of the community to be satisfied with managing the affairs which\nhis master intrusted to him, adventured in a little business on his own\naccount; and thinking, I suppose, that the late Earl of Etherington had\nforgotten fully to acknowledge his services, as valet to his son, he\nsupplied that defect by a small check on our house for L.100, in name,\nand bearing the apparent signature, of the deceased. This small mistake\nbeing detected, Mr. Solmes, _porteur_ of the little billet, would have\nbeen consigned to the custody of a Bow-street officer, but that I found\nmeans to relieve him, on condition of his making known to me the points\nof private history which I have just been communicating to you. What I\nhad known of Tyrrel at Smyrna, had given me much interest in him, and\nyou may guess it was not lessened by the distresses which he had\nsustained through his brother's treachery. By this fellow's means, I\nhave counterplotted all his master's fine schemes. For example, as soon\nas I learned Bulmer was coming down here, I contrived to give Tyrrel an\nanonymous hint, well knowing he would set off like the devil to thwart\nhim, and so I should have the whole dramatis person\u00c3\u00a6 together, and play\nthem all off against each other, after my own pleasure.\"\n\n\"In that case,\" said Mr. Mowbray, \"your expedient brought about the\nrencontre between the two brothers, when both might have fallen.\"\n\n\"Can't deny it--can't deny it,\" answered Scrogie, a little\ndiscountenanced--\"a mere accident--no one can guard every point.--Egad,\nbut I had like to have been baffled again, for Bulmer sent the lad\nJekyl, who is not such a black sheep neither but what there are some\nwhite hairs about him, upon a treaty with Tyrrel, that my secret agent\nwas not admitted to. Gad, but I discovered the whole--you will scarce\nguess how.\"\n\n\"Probably not easily, indeed, sir,\" answered Mowbray; \"for your sources\nof intelligence are not the most obvious, any more than your mode of\nacting the most simple or most comprehensible.\"\n\n\"I would not have it so,\" said Touchwood; \"simple men perish in their\nsimplicity--I carry my eye-teeth about me.--And for my source of\ninformation--why, I played the eavesdropper, sir--listened--knew my\nlandlady's cupboard with the double door--got into it as she has done\nmany a time.--Such a fine gentleman as you would rather cut a man's\nthroat, I suppose, than listen at a cupboard door, though the object\nwere to prevent murder?\"\n\n\"I cannot say I should have thought of the expedient, certainly, sir,\"\nsaid Mowbray.\n\n\"I did, though,\" said Scrogie, \"and learned enough of what was going on,\nto give Jekyl a hint that sickened him of his commission, I believe--so\nthe game is all in my own hands. Bulmer has no one to trust to but\nSolmes, and Solmes tells me every thing.\"\n\nHere Mowbray could not suppress a movement of impatience.\n\n\"I wish to God, sir, that since you were so kind as to interest yourself\nin affairs so intimately concerning my family, you had been pleased to\nact with a little more openness towards me. Here have I been for weeks\nthe intimate of a damned scoundrel, whose throat I ought to have cut for\nhis scandalous conduct to my sister. Here have I been rendering her and\nmyself miserable, and getting myself cheated every night by a swindler,\nwhom you, if it had been your pleasure, could have unmasked by a single\nword. I do all justice to your intentions, sir; but, upon my soul, I\ncannot help wishing you had conducted yourself with more frankness and\nless mystery; and I am truly afraid your love of dexterity has been too\nmuch for your ingenuity, and that you have suffered matters to run into\nsuch a skein of confusion, as you yourself will find difficulty in\nunravelling.\"\n\nTouchwood smiled, and shook his head in all the conscious pride of\nsuperior understanding. \"Young man,\" he said, \"when you have seen a\nlittle of the world, and especially beyond the bounds of this narrow\nisland, you will find much more art and dexterity necessary in\nconducting these businesses to an issue, than occurs to a blind John\nBull, or a raw Scotchman. You will be then no stranger to the policy of\nlife, which deals in mining and countermining,--now in making feints,\nnow in thrusting with forthright passes. I look upon you, Mr. Mowbray,\nas a young man spoiled by staying at home, and keeping bad company; and\nwill make it my business, if you submit yourself to my guidance, to\ninform your understanding, so as to retrieve your estate.--Don't--Don't\nanswer me, sir! because I know too well, by experience, how young men\nanswer on these subjects--they are conceited, sir, as conceited as if\nthey had been in all the four quarters of the world. I hate to be\nanswered, sir, I hate it. And, to tell you the truth, it is because\nTyrrel has a fancy of answering me, that I rather make you my confidant\non this occasion, than him. I would have had him throw himself into my\narms, and under my directions; but he hesitated--he hesitated, Mr.\nMowbray--and I despise hesitation. If he thinks he has wit enough to\nmanage his own matters, let him try it--let him try it. Not but I will\ndo all I can for him, in fitting time and place; but I will let him\ndwell in his perplexities and uncertainties for a little while longer.\nAnd so, Mr. Mowbray, you see what sort of an odd fellow I am, and you\ncan satisfy me at once whether you mean to come into my measures--only\nspeak out at once, sir, for I abhor hesitation.\"\n\nWhile Touchwood thus spoke, Mowbray was forming his resolution\ninternally. He was not so inexperienced as the senior supposed; at\nleast, he could plainly see that he had to do with an obstinate,\ncapricious old man, who, with the best intentions in the world, chose\nto have every thing in his own way; and, like most petty politicians,\nwas disposed to throw intrigue and mystery over matters which had much\nbetter be prosecuted boldly and openly. But he perceived at the same\ntime, that Touchwood, as a sort of relation, wealthy, childless, and\ndisposed to become his friend, was a person to be conciliated, the\nrather that the traveller himself had frankly owned that it was Francis\nTyrrel's want of deference towards him, which had forfeited, or at least\nabated, his favour. Mowbray recollected, also, that the circumstances\nunder which he himself stood, did not permit him to trifle with\nreturning gleams of good fortune. Subduing, therefore, the haughtiness\nof temper proper to him as an only son and heir, he answered\nrespectfully, that, in his condition, the advice and assistance of Mr.\nScrogie Touchwood were too important, not to be purchased at the price\nof submitting his own judgment to that of an experienced and sagacious\nfriend.\n\n\"Well said, Mr. Mowbray,\" replied the senior, \"well said. Let me once\nhave the management of your affairs, and we will brush them up for you\nwithout loss of time.--I must be obliged to you for a bed for the night,\nhowever--it is as dark as a wolf's mouth; and if you will give orders to\nkeep the poor devil of a postilion, and his horses too, why, I will be\nthe more obliged to you.\"\n\nMowbray applied himself to the bell. Patrick answered the call, and was\nmuch surprised, when the old gentleman, taking the word out of his\nentertainer's mouth, desired a bed to be got ready, with a little fire\nin the grate; \"for I take it, friend,\" he went on, \"you have not guests\nhere very often.--And see that my sheets be not damp, and bid the\nhousemaid take care not to make the bed upon an exact level, but let it\nslope from the pillow to the footposts, at a declivity of about eighteen\ninches.--And hark ye--get me a jug of barley-water, to place by my\nbedside, with the squeeze of a lemon--or stay, you will make it as sour\nas Beelzebub--bring the lemon on a saucer, and I will mix it myself.\"\n\nPatrick listened like one of sense forlorn, his head turning like a\nmandarin, alternately from the speaker to his master, as if to ask the\nlatter whether this was all reality. The instant that Touchwood stopped,\nMowbray added his fiat.\n\n\"Let every thing be done to make Mr. Touchwood comfortable, in the way\nhe wishes.\"\n\n\"Aweel, sir,\" said Patrick, \"I shall tell Mally, to be sure, and we maun\ndo our best, and--but it's unco late\"----\n\n\"And, therefore,\" said Touchwood, \"the sooner we get to bed the better,\nmy old friend. I, for one, must be stirring early--I have business of\nlife and death--it concerns you too, Mr. Mowbray--but no more of that\ntill to-morrow.--And let the lad put up his horses, and get him a bed\nsomewhere.\"\n\nPatrick here thought he had gotten upon firm ground for resistance, for\nwhich, displeased with the dictatorial manner of the stranger, he felt\nconsiderably inclined.\n\n\"Ye may catch us at that, if ye can,\" said Patrick; \"there's nae post\ncattle come into our stables--What do we ken, but that they may be\nglandered, as the groom says?\"\n\n\"We must take the risk to-night, Patrick,\" said Mowbray, reluctantly\nenough--\"unless Mr. Touchwood will permit the horses to come back early\nnext morning?\"\n\n\"Not I, indeed,\" said Touchwood; \"safe bind safe find--it may be once\naway and aye away, and we shall have enough to do to-morrow morning.\nMoreover, the poor carrion are tired, and the merciful man is merciful\nto his beast--and, in a word, if the horses go back to St. Ronan's Well\nto-night, I go there for company.\"\n\nIt often happens, owing, I suppose, to the perversity of human nature,\nthat subserviency in trifles is more difficult to a proud mind, than\ncompliance in matters of more importance. Mowbray, like other young\ngentlemen of his class, was finically rigid in his stable discipline,\nand even Lord Etherington's horses had not been admitted into that\n_sanctum sanctorum_, into which he now saw himself obliged to induct two\nwretched post-hacks. But he submitted with the best grace he could; and\nPatrick, while he left their presence, with lifted-up hands and eyes to\nexecute the orders he had received, could scarcely help thinking that\nthe old man must be the devil in disguise, since he could thus suddenly\ncontrol his fiery master, even in the points which he had hitherto\nseemed to consider as of most vital importance.\n\n\"The Lord in his mercy haud a grip of this puir family! for I, that was\nborn in it, am like to see the end of it.\" Thus ejaculated Patrick.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII.\n\nTHE WANDERER.\n\n    'Tis a naughty night to swim in.\n\n_King Lear._\n\n\nThere was a wild uncertainty about Mowbray's ideas, after he started\nfrom a feverish sleep on the morning succeeding this memorable\ninterview, that his sister, whom he really loved as much as he was\ncapable of loving any thing, had dishonoured him and her name; and the\nhorrid recollection of their last interview was the first idea which his\nwaking imagination was thrilled with. Then came Touchwood's tale of\nexculpation--and he persuaded himself, or strove to do so, that Clara\nmust have understood the charge he had brought against her as referring\nto her attachment to Tyrrel, and its fatal consequences. Again, still he\ndoubted how that could be--still feared that there must be more behind\nthan her reluctance to confess the fraud which had been practised on her\nby Bulmer; and then, again, he strengthened himself in the first and\nmore pleasing opinion, by recollecting that, averse as she was to\nespouse the person he proposed to her, it must have appeared to her the\ncompletion of ruin, if he, Mowbray, should obtain knowledge of the\nclandestine marriage.\n\n\"Yes--O yes,\" he said to himself, \"she would think that this story would\nrender me more eager in the rascal's interest, as the best way of\nhushing up such a discreditable affair--faith, and she would have judged\nright too; for, had he actually been Lord Etherington, I do not see what\nelse she could have done. But, not being Lord Etherington, and an\nanointed scoundrel into the bargain, I will content myself with\ncudgelling him to death so soon as I can get out of the guardianship of\nthis old, meddling, obstinate, self-willed, busybody.--Then, what is to\nbe done for Clara?--This mock marriage was a mere bubble, and both\nparties must draw stakes. She likes this grave Don, who proves to be the\nstick of the right tree, after all--so do not I, though there be\nsomething lordlike about him. I was sure a strolling painter could not\nhave carried it off so. She may marry him, I suppose, if the law is not\nagainst it--then she has the earldom, and the Oaklands, and Nettlewood,\nall at once.--Gad, we should come in winners, after all--and, I dare\nsay, this old boy Touchwood is as rich as a Jew--worth a hundred\nthousand at least--He is too peremptory to be cut up for sixpence under\na hundred thousand.--And he talks of putting me to rights--I must not\nwince--must stand still to be curried a little--Only, I wish the law may\npermit Clara's being married to this other earl.--A woman cannot marry\ntwo brothers, that is certain:--but then, if she is not married to the\none of them in good and lawful form, there can be no bar to her marrying\nthe other, I should think--I hope the lawyers will talk no nonsense\nabout it--I hope Clara will have no foolish scruples.--But, by my word,\nthe first thing I have to hope is, that the thing is true, for it comes\nthrough but a suspicious channel. I'll away to Clara instantly--get the\ntruth out of her--and consider what is to be done.\"\n\nThus partly thought and partly spoke the young Laird of St. Ronan's,\nhastily dressing himself, in order to enquire into the strange chaos of\nevents which perplexed his imagination.\n\nWhen he came down to the parlour where they had supped last night, and\nwhere breakfast was prepared this morning, he sent for a girl who acted\nas his sister's immediate attendant, and asked, \"if Miss Mowbray was yet\nstirring?\"\n\nThe girl answered, \"she had not rung her bell.\"\n\n\"It is past her usual hour,\" said Mowbray, \"but she was disturbed last\nnight. Go, Martha, tell her to get up instantly--say I have excellent\ngood news for her--or, if her head aches, I will come and tell them to\nher before she rises--go like lightning.\"\n\nMartha went, and returned in a minute or two. \"I cannot make my mistress\nhear, sir, knock as loud as I will. I wish,\" she added, with that love\nof evil presage which is common in the lower ranks, \"that Miss Clara may\nbe well, for I never knew her sleep so sound.\"\n\nMowbray jumped from the chair into which he had thrown himself, ran\nthrough the gallery, and knocked smartly at his sister's door; there was\nno answer. \"Clara, dear Clara!--Answer me but one word--say but you are\nwell. I frightened you last night--I had been drinking wine--I was\nviolent--forgive me!--Come, do not be sulky--speak but a single\nword--say but you are well.\"\n\nHe made the pauses longer betwixt every branch of his address, knocked\nsharper and louder, listened more anxiously for an answer; at length he\nattempted to open the door, but found it locked, or otherwise secured.\n\"Does Miss Mowbray always lock her door?\" he asked the girl.\n\n\"Never knew her to do it before, sir; she leaves it open that I may call\nher, and open the window-shutters.\"\n\nShe had too good reason for precaution last night, thought her brother,\nand then remembered having heard her bar the door.\n\n\"Come, Clara,\" he continued, greatly agitated, \"do not be silly; if you\nwill not open the door, I must force it, that's all; for how can I tell\nbut that you are sick, and unable to answer?--if you are only sullen,\nsay so.--She returns no answer,\" he said, turning to the domestic, who\nwas now joined by Touchwood.\n\nMowbray's anxiety was so great, that it prevented his taking any notice\nof his guest, and he proceeded to say, without regarding his presence,\n\"What is to be done?--she may be sick--she may be asleep--she may have\nswooned; if I force the door, it may terrify her to death in the present\nweak state of her nerves.--Clara, dear Clara! do but speak a single\nword, and you shall remain in your own room as long as you please.\"\n\nThere was no answer. Miss Mowbray's maid, hitherto too much fluttered\nand alarmed to have much presence of mind, now recollected a back-stair\nwhich communicated with her mistress's room from the garden, and\nsuggested she might have gone out that way.\n\n\"Gone out,\" said Mowbray, in great anxiety, and looking at the heavy\nfog, or rather small rain, which blotted the November morning,--\"Gone\nout, and in weather like this!--But we may get into her room from the\nback-stair.\"\n\nSo saying, and leaving his guest to follow or remain as he thought\nproper, he flew rather than walked to the garden, and found the private\ndoor which led into it, from the bottom of the back-stair above\nmentioned, was wide open. Full of vague, but fearful apprehensions, he\nrushed up to the door of his sister's apartment, which opened from her\ndressing-room to the landing-place of the stair; it was ajar, and that\nwhich communicated betwixt the bedroom and dressing-room was half open.\n\"Clara, Clara!\" exclaimed Mowbray, invoking her name rather in an agony\nof apprehension, than as any longer hoping for a reply. And his\napprehension was but too prophetic.\n\nMiss Mowbray was not in that apartment; and, from the order in which it\nwas found, it was plain she had neither undressed on the preceding\nnight, nor occupied the bed. Mowbray struck his forehead in an agony of\nremorse and fear. \"I have terrified her to death,\" he said; \"she has\nfled into the woods, and perished there!\"\n\nUnder the influence of this apprehension, Mowbray, after another hasty\nglance around the apartment, as if to assure himself that Clara was not\nthere, rushed again into the dressing-room, almost overturning the\ntraveller, who, in civility, had not ventured to enter the inner\napartment. \"You are as mad as a _Hamako_,\"[II-11] said the traveller; \"let\nus consult together, and I am sure I can contrive\"----\n\n\"Oh, d--n your contrivance!\" said Mowbray, forgetting all proposed\nrespect in his natural impatience, aggravated by his alarm; \"if you had\nbehaved straight-forward, and like a man of common sense, this would not\nhave happened!\"\n\n\"God forgive you, young man, if your reflections are unjust,\" said the\ntraveller, quitting the hold he had laid upon Mowbray's coat; \"and God\nforgive me too, if I have done wrong while endeavouring to do for the\nbest!--But may not Miss Mowbray have gone down to the Well? I will order\nmy horses, and set off instantly.\"\n\n\"Do, do,\" said Mowbray, recklessly; \"I thank you, I thank you;\" and\nhastily traversing the garden, as if desirous to get rid at once of his\nvisitor and his own thoughts, he took the shortest road to a little\npostern-gate, which led into the extensive copsewood, through some part\nof which Clara had caused a walk to be cut to a little summer-house\nbuilt of rough shingles, covered with creeping shrubs.\n\nAs Mowbray hastened through the garden, he met the old man by whom it\nwas kept, a native of the south country, and an old dependent on the\nfamily. \"Have you seen my sister?\" said Mowbray, hurrying his words on\neach other with the eagerness of terror.\n\n\"What's your wull, St. Ronan's?\" answered the old man, at once dull of\nhearing, and slow of apprehension.\n\n\"Have you seen Miss Clara?\" shouted Mowbray, and muttered an oath or two\nat the gardener's stupidity.\n\n\"In troth have I,\" replied the gardener, deliberately; \"what suld ail\nme to see Miss Clara, St. Ronan's?\"\n\n\"When, and where?\" eagerly demanded the querist.\n\n\"Ou, just yestreen, after tey-time--afore ye cam hame yoursell galloping\nsae fast,\" said old Joseph.\n\n\"I am as stupid as he, to put off my time in speaking to such an old\ncabbage-stock!\" said Mowbray, and hastened on to the postern-gate\nalready mentioned, leading from the garden into what was usually called\nMiss Clara's walk. Two or three domestics, whispering to each other, and\nwith countenances that showed grief, fear, and suspicion, followed their\nmaster, desirous to be employed, yet afraid to force their services on\nthe fiery young man.\n\nAt the little postern he found some trace of her he sought. The pass-key\nof Clara was left in the lock. It was then plain that she must have\npassed that way; but at what hour, or for what purpose, Mowbray dared\nnot conjecture. The path, after running a quarter of a mile or more\nthrough an open grove of oaks and sycamores, attained the verge of the\nlarge brook, and became there steep and rocky, difficult to the infirm,\nand alarming to the nervous; often approaching the brink of a\nprecipitous ledge of rock, which in this place overhung the stream, in\nsome places brawling and foaming in hasty current, and in others seeming\nto slumber in deep and circular eddies. The temptations which this\ndangerous scene must have offered an excited and desperate spirit, came\non Mowbray like the blight of the Simoom, and he stood a moment to\ngather breath and overcome these horrible anticipations, ere he was able\nto proceed. His attendants felt the same apprehension. \"Puir thing--puir\nthing!--O, God send she may not have been left to hersell!--God send she\nmay have been upholden!\" were whispered by Patrick to the maidens, and\nby them to each other.\n\nAt this moment the old gardener was heard behind them, shouting,\n\"Master--St. Ronan's--Master--I have fund--I have fund\"----\n\n\"Have you found my sister?\" exclaimed the brother, with breathless\nanxiety.\n\nThe old man did not answer till he came up, and then, with his usual\nslowness of delivery, he replied to his master's repeated enquiries,\n\"Na, I haena fund Miss Clara, but I hae fund something ye wad be wae to\nlose--your braw hunting-knife.\"\n\nHe put the implement into the hand of its owner, who, recollecting the\ncircumstances under which he had flung it from him last night, and the\nnow too probable consequences of that interview, bestowed on it a deep\nimprecation, and again hurled it from him into the brook. The domestics\nlooked at each other, and recollecting each at the same time that the\nknife was a favourite tool of their master, who was rather curious in\nsuch articles, had little doubt that his mind was affected, in a\ntemporary way at least, by his anxiety on his sister's account. He saw\ntheir confused and inquisitive looks, and assuming as much composure and\npresence of mind as he could command, directed Martha, and her female\ncompanions, to return and search the walks on the other side of\nShaws-Castle; and, finally, ordered Patrick back to ring the bell,\n\"which,\" he said, assuming a confidence that he was far from\nentertaining, \"might call Miss Mowbray home from some of her long\nwalks.\" He farther desired his groom and horses might meet him at the\nClattering Brig, so called from a noisy cascade which was formed by the\nbrook, above which was stretched a small foot-bridge of planks. Having\nthus shaken off his attendants, he proceeded himself, with all the speed\nhe was capable of exerting, to follow out the path in which he was at\npresent engaged, which, being a favourite walk with his sister, she\nmight perhaps have adopted from mere habit, when in a state of mind,\nwhich, he had too much reason to fear, must have put choice out of the\nquestion.\n\nHe soon reached the summer-house, which was merely a seat covered\noverhead and on the sides, open in front, and neatly paved with pebbles.\nThis little bower was perched, like a hawk's nest, almost upon the edge\nof a projecting crag, the highest point of the line of rock which we\nhave noticed; and had been selected by poor Clara, on account of the\nprospect which it commanded down the valley. One of her gloves lay on\nthe small rustic table in the summer-house. Mowbray caught it eagerly\nup. It was drenched with wet--the preceding day had been dry; so that,\nhad she forgot it there in the morning, or in the course of the day, it\ncould not have been in that state. She had certainly been there during\nthe night, when it rained heavily.\n\nMowbray, thus assured that Clara had been in this place, while her\npassions and fears were so much afloat as they must have been at her\nflight from her father's house, cast a hurried and terrified glance from\nthe brow of the precipice into the deep stream that eddied below. It\nseemed to him that, in the sullen roar of the water, he heard the last\ngroans of his sister--the foam-flakes caught his eye, as if they were a\npart of her garments. But a closer examination showed that there was no\nappearance of such a catastrophe. Descending the path on the other side\nof the bower, he observed a foot-print in a place where the clay was\nmoist and tenacious, which, from the small size, and the shape of the\nshoe, it appeared to him must be a trace of her whom he sought. He\nhurried forward, therefore, with as much speed, as yet permitted him to\nlook out keenly for similar impressions, of which it seemed to him he\nremarked several, although less perfect than the former, being much\nobliterated by the quantity of rain that had since fallen,--a\ncircumstance seeming to prove that several hours had elapsed since the\nperson had passed.\n\nAt length, through the various turnings and windings of a long and\nromantic path, Mowbray found himself, without having received any\nsatisfactory intelligence, by the side of the brook, called St. Ronan's\nBurn, at the place where it was crossed by foot-passengers, by the\nClattering Brig, and by horsemen through a ford a little lower. At this\npoint the fugitive might have either continued her wanderings through\nher paternal woods, by a path which, after winding about a mile,\nreturned to Shaws-Castle, or she might have crossed the bridge, and\nentered a broken horse-way, common to the public, leading to the Aultoun\nof St. Ronan's.\n\nMowbray, after a moment's consideration, concluded that the last was her\nmost probable option.--He mounted his horse, which the groom had brought\ndown according to order, and commanding the man to return by the\nfootpath, which he himself could not examine, he proceeded to ride\ntowards the ford. The brook was swollen during the night, and the groom\ncould not forbear intimating to his master, that there was considerable\ndanger in attempting to cross it. But Mowbray's mind and feelings were\ntoo high-strung to permit him to listen to cautious counsel. He spurred\nthe snorting and reluctant horse into the torrent, though the water,\nrising high on the upper side, broke both over the pommel and the croupe\nof his saddle. It was by exertion of great strength and sagacity, that\nthe good horse kept the ford-way. Had the stream forced him down among\nthe rocks, which lie below the crossing-place, the consequences must\nhave been fatal. Mowbray, however, reached the opposite side in safety,\nto the joy and admiration of the servant, who stood staring at him\nduring the adventure. He then rode hastily towards the Aultoun,\ndetermined, if he could not hear tidings of his sister in that village,\nthat he would spread the alarm, and institute a general search after\nher, since her elopement from Shaws-Castle could, in that case, no\nlonger be concealed. We must leave him, however, in his present state of\nuncertainty, in order to acquaint our readers with the reality of those\nevils, which his foreboding mind and disturbed conscience could only\nanticipate.\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[II-11] A fool is so termed in Turkey.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX.\n\nTHE CATASTROPHE.\n\n    What sheeted ghost is wandering through the storm?\n    For never did a maid of middle earth\n    Choose such a time or spot to vent her sorrows.\n\n_Old Play._\n\n\nGrief, shame, confusion, and terror, had contributed to overwhelm the\nunfortunate Clara Mowbray at the moment when she parted with her\nbrother, after the stormy and dangerous interview which it was our task\nto record in a former chapter. For years, her life, her whole tenor of\nthought, had been haunted by the terrible apprehension of a discovery,\nand now the thing which she feared had come upon her. The extreme\nviolence of her brother, which went so far as to menace her personal\nsafety, had united with the previous conflict of passions, to produce a\nrapture of fear, which probably left her no other free agency, than that\nwhich she derived from the blind instinct which urges flight, as the\nreadiest resource in danger.\n\nWe have no means of exactly tracing the course of this unhappy young\nwoman. It is probable she fled from Shaws-Castle, on hearing the arrival\nof Mr. Touchwood's carriage, which she might mistake for that of Lord\nEtherington; and thus, while Mowbray was looking forward to the happier\nprospects which the traveller's narrative seemed to open, his sister\nwas contending with rain and darkness, amidst the difficulties and\ndangers of the mountain path which we have described. These were so\ngreat, that a young woman more delicately brought up, must either have\nlain down exhausted, or have been compelled to turn her steps back to\nthe residence she had abandoned. But the solitary wanderings of Clara\nhad inured her to fatigue and to night-walks; and the deeper causes of\nterror which urged her to flight, rendered her insensible to the perils\nof her way. She had passed the bower, as was evident from her glove\nremaining there, and had crossed the foot-bridge; although it was almost\nwonderful, that, in so dark a night, she should have followed with such\naccuracy a track, where the missing a single turn by a cubit's length,\nmight have precipitated her into eternity.\n\nIt is probable, that Clara's spirits and strength began in some degree\nto fail her, after she had proceeded a little way on the road to the\nAultoun; for she had stopped at the solitary cottage inhabited by the\nold female pauper, who had been for a time the hostess of the penitent\nand dying Hannah Irwin. Here, as the inmate of the cottage acknowledged,\nshe had made some knocking, and she owned she had heard her moan\nbitterly, as she entreated for admission. The old hag was one of those\nwhose hearts adversity turns to very stone, and obstinately kept her\ndoor shut, impelled more probably by general hatred to the human race,\nthan by the superstitious fears which seized her; although she\nperversely argued that she was startled at the supernatural melody and\nsweetness of tone, with which the benighted wanderer made her\nsupplication. She admitted, that when she heard the poor petitioner\nturn from the door, her heart was softened, and she did intend to open\nwith the purpose of offering her at least a shelter; but that before she\ncould \"hirple to the door, and get the bar taken down,\" the unfortunate\nsupplicant was not to be seen; which strengthened the old woman's\nopinion, that the whole was a delusion of Satan.\n\nIt is conjectured that the repulsed wanderer made no other attempt to\nawaken pity or obtain shelter, until she came to Mr. Cargill's Manse, in\nthe upper room of which a light was still burning, owing to a cause\nwhich requires some explanation.\n\nThe reader is aware of the reasons which induced Bulmer, or the titular\nLord Etherington, to withdraw from the country the sole witness, as he\nconceived, who could, or at least who might choose to bear witness to\nthe fraud which he had practised on the unfortunate Clara Mowbray. Of\nthree persons present at the marriage, besides the parties, the\nclergyman was completely deceived. Solmes he conceived to be at his own\nexclusive devotion; and therefore, if by his means this Hannah Irwin\ncould be removed from the scene, he argued plausibly, that all evidence\nto the treachery which he had practised would be effectually stifled.\nHence his agent, Solmes, had received a commission, as the reader may\nremember, to effect her removal without loss of time, and had reported\nto his master that his efforts had been effectual.\n\nBut Solmes, since he had fallen under the influence of Touchwood, was\nconstantly employed in counteracting the schemes which he seemed most\nactive in forwarding, while the traveller enjoyed (to him an exquisite\ngratification) the amusement of countermining as fast as Bulmer could\nmine, and had in prospect the pleasing anticipation of blowing up the\npioneer with his own petard. For this purpose, as soon as Touchwood\nlearned that his house was to be applied to for the original deeds left\nin charge by the deceased Earl of Etherington, he expedited a letter,\ndirecting that only the copies should be sent, and thus rendered\nnugatory Bulmer's desperate design of possessing himself of that\nevidence. For the same reason, when Solmes announced to him his master's\nanxious wish to have Hannah Irwin conveyed out of the country, he\nappointed him to cause the sick woman to be carefully transported to the\nManse, where Mr. Cargill was easily induced to give her temporary\nrefuge.\n\nTo this good man, who might be termed an Israelite without guile, the\ndistress of the unhappy woman would have proved a sufficient\nrecommendation; nor was he likely to have enquired whether her malady\nmight not be infectious, or to have made any of those other previous\ninvestigations which are sometimes clogs upon the bounty or hospitality\nof more prudent philanthropists. But to interest him yet farther, Mr.\nTouchwood informed him by letter that the patient (not otherwise unknown\nto him) was possessed of certain most material information affecting a\nfamily of honour and consequence, and that he himself, with Mr. Mowbray\nof St. Ronan's in the quality of a magistrate, intended to be at the\nManse that evening, to take her declaration upon this important\nsubject. Such indeed was the traveller's purpose, which might have been\ncarried into effect, but for his own self-important love of manoeuvring\non the one part, and the fiery impatience of Mowbray on the other,\nwhich, as the reader knows, sent the one at full gallop to Shaws-Castle,\nand obliged the other to follow him post haste. This necessity he\nintimated to the clergyman by a note, which he dispatched express as he\nhimself was in the act of stepping into the chaise.\n\nHe requested that the most particular attention should be paid to the\ninvalid--promised to be at the Manse with Mr. Mowbray early on the\nmorrow--and, with the lingering and inveterate self-conceit which always\ninduced him to conduct every thing with his own hand, directed his\nfriend, Mr. Cargill, not to proceed to take the sick woman's declaration\nor confession until he arrived, unless in case of extremity.\n\nIt had been an easy matter for Solmes to transfer the invalid from the\nwretched cottage to the clergyman's Manse. The first appearance of the\nassociate of much of her guilt had indeed terrified her; but he scrupled\nnot to assure her, that his penitence was equal to her own, and that he\nwas conveying her where their joint deposition would be formally\nreceived, in order that they might, so far as possible, atone for the\nevil of which they had been jointly guilty. He also promised her kind\nusage for herself, and support for her children; and she willingly\naccompanied him to the clergyman's residence, he himself resolving to\nabide in concealment the issue of the mystery, without again facing his\nmaster, whose star, as he well discerned, was about to shoot speedily\nfrom its exalted sphere.\n\nThe clergyman visited the unfortunate patient, as he had done frequently\nduring her residence in his vicinity, and desired that she might be\ncarefully attended. During the whole day, she seemed better; but,\nwhether the means of supporting her exhausted frame had been too\nliberally administered, or whether the thoughts which gnawed her\nconscience had returned with double severity when she was released from\nthe pressure of immediate want, it is certain that, about midnight, the\nfever began to gain ground, and the person placed in attendance on her\ncame to inform the clergyman, then deeply engaged with the siege of\nPtolemais, that she doubted if the woman would live till morning, and\nthat she had something lay heavy at her heart, which she wished, as the\nemissary expressed it, \"to make, a clean breast of\" before she died, or\nlost possession of her senses.\n\nAwakened by such a crisis, Mr. Cargill at once became a man of this\nworld, clear in his apprehension, and cool in his resolution, as he\nalways was when the path of duty lay before him. Comprehending, from the\nvarious hints of his friend Touchwood, that the matter was of the last\nconsequence, his own humanity, as well as inexperience, dictated his\nsending for skilful assistance. His man-servant was accordingly\ndispatched on horseback to the Well for Dr. Quackleben; while, upon the\nsuggestion of one of his maids, \"that Mrs. Dods was an uncommon skeely\nbody about a sick-bed,\" the wench was dismissed to supplicate the\nassistance of the gudewife of the Cleikum, which she was not, indeed,\nwont to refuse whenever it could be useful. The male emissary proved, in\nScottish phrase, a \"corbie messenger;\"[II-G] for either he did not find the\ndoctor, or he found him better engaged than to attend the sick-bed of a\npauper, at a request which promised such slight remuneration as that of\na parish minister. But the female ambassador was more successful; for,\nthough she found our friend Luckie Dods preparing for bed at an hour\nunusually late, in consequence of some anxiety on account of Mr.\nTouchwood's unexpected absence, the good old dame only growled a little\nabout the minister's fancies in taking puir bodies into his own house;\nand then, instantly donning cloak, hood, and pattens, marched down the\ngate with all the speed of the good Samaritan, one maid bearing the\nlantern before her, while the other remained to keep the house, and to\nattend to the wants of Mr. Tyrrel, who engaged willingly to sit up to\nreceive Mr. Touchwood.\n\nBut, ere Dame Dods had arrived at the Manse, the patient had summoned\nMr. Cargill to her presence, and required him to write her confession\nwhile she had life and breath to make it.\n\n\"For I believe,\" she added, raising herself in the bed, and rolling her\neyes wildly around, \"that, were I to confess my guilt to one of a less\nsacred character, the Evil Spirit, whose servant I have been, would\ncarry away his prey, both body and soul, before they had severed from\neach other, however short the space that they must remain in\npartnership!\"\n\nMr. Cargill would have spoken some ghostly consolation, but she answered\nwith pettish impatience, \"Waste not words--waste not words!--Let me\nspeak that which I must tell, and sign it with my hand; and do you, as\nthe more immediate servant of God, and therefore bound to bear witness\nto the truth, take heed you write that which I tell you, and nothing\nelse. I desired to have told this to St. Ronan's--I have even made some\nprogress in telling it to others--but I am glad I broke short off--for I\nknow you, Josiah Cargill, though you have long forgotten me.\"\n\n\"It may be so,\" said Cargill. \"I have indeed no recollection of you.\"\n\n\"You once knew Hannah Irwin, though,\" said the sick woman, \"who was\ncompanion and relation to Miss Clara Mowbray, and who was present with\nher on that sinful night, when she was wedded in the kirk of St.\nRonan's.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that you are that person?\" said Cargill, holding the\ncandle so as to throw some light on the face of the sick woman. \"I\ncannot believe it.\"\n\n\"No?\" replied the penitent; \"there is indeed a difference between\nwickedness in the act of carrying through its successful machinations,\nand wickedness surrounded by all the horrors of a death-bed!\"\n\n\"Do not yet despair,\" said Cargill. \"Grace is omnipotent--to doubt this\nis in itself a great crime.\"\n\n\"Be it so!--I cannot help it--my heart is hardened, Mr. Cargill; and\nthere is something here,\" she pressed her bosom, \"which tells me, that,\nwith prolonged life and renewed health, even my present agonies would be\nforgotten, and I should become the same I have been before. I have\nrejected the offer of grace, Mr. Cargill, and not through ignorance, for\nI have sinned with my eyes open. Care not for me, then, who am a mere\noutcast.\" He again endeavoured to interrupt her, but she continued, \"Or\nif you really wish my welfare, let me relieve my bosom of that which\npresses it, and it may be that I shall then be better able to listen to\nyou. You say you remember me not--but if I tell you how often you\nrefused to perform in secret the office which was required of you--how\nmuch you urged that it was against your canonical rules--if I name the\nargument to which you yielded--and remind you of your purpose, to\nacknowledge your transgression to your brethren in the church courts, to\nplead your excuse, and submit to their censure, which you said could not\nbe a light one--you will be then aware, that, in the voice of the\nmiserable pauper, you hear the words of the once artful, gay, and\nspecious Hannah Irwin.\"\n\n\"I allow it--I allow it!\" said Mr. Cargill; \"I admit the tokens, and\nbelieve you to be indeed her whose name you assume.\"\n\n\"Then one painful step is over,\" said she; \"for I would ere now have\nlightened my conscience by confession, saving for the cursed pride of\nspirit, which was ashamed of poverty, though it had not shrunk from\nguilt.--Well--In these arguments, which were urged to you by a youth\nbest known to you by the name of Francis Tyrrel, though more properly\nentitled to that of Valentine Bulmer, we practised on you a base and\ngross deception.--Did you not hear some one sigh?--I hope there is no\none in the room--I trust I shall die when my confession is signed and\nsealed, without my name being dragged through the public--I hope ye\nbring not in your menials to gaze on my abject misery--I cannot brook\nthat.\"\n\nShe paused and listened; for the ear, usually deafened by pain, is\nsometimes, on the contrary, rendered morbidly acute. Mr. Cargill assured\nher, there was no one present but himself. \"But, O, most unhappy woman!\"\nhe said, \"what does your introduction prepare me to expect!\"\n\n\"Your expectation, be it ever so ominous, shall be fully satisfied.--I\nwas the guilty confidant of the false Francis Tyrrel.--Clara loved the\ntrue one.--When the fatal ceremony passed, the bride and the clergyman\nwere deceived alike--and I was the wretch--the fiend--who, aiding\nanother yet blacker, if blacker could be--mainly helped to accomplish\nthis cureless misery!\"\n\n\"Wretch!\" exclaimed the clergyman, \"and had you not then done\nenough?--Why did you expose the betrothed of one brother to become the\nwife of another?\"\n\n\"I acted,\" said the sick woman, \"only as Bulmer instructed me; but I had\nto do with a master of the game. He contrived, by his agent Solmes, to\nmatch me with a husband imposed on me by his devices as a man of\nfortune!--a wretch, who maltreated me--plundered me--sold me.--Oh! if\nfiends laugh, as I have heard they can, what a jubilee of scorn will\nthere be, when Bulmer and I enter their place of torture!--Hark!--I am\nsure of it--some one draws breath, as if shuddering!\"\n\n\"You will distract yourself if you give way to these fancies. Be\ncalm--speak on--but, oh! at last, and for once, speak the truth!\"\n\n\"I will, for it will best gratify my hatred against him, who, having\nfirst robbed me of my virtue, made me a sport and a plunder to the\nbasest of the species. For that I wandered here to unmask him. I had\nheard he again stirred his suit to Clara, and I came here to tell young\nMowbray the whole.--But do you wonder that I shrunk from doing so till\nthis last decisive moment?--I thought of my conduct to Clara, and how\ncould I face her brother?--And yet I hated her not after I learned her\nutter wretchedness--her deep misery, verging even upon madness--I hated\nher not then. I was sorry that she was not to fall to the lot of a\nbetter man than Bulmer;--and I pitied her after she was rescued by\nTyrrel, and you may remember it was I who prevailed on you to conceal\nher marriage.\"\n\n\"I remember it,\" answered Cargill, \"and that you alleged, as a reason\nfor secrecy, danger from her family. I did conceal it, until reports\nthat she was again to be married reached my ears.\"\n\n\"Well, then,\" said the sick woman, \"Clara Mowbray ought to forgive\nme--since what ill I have done her was inevitable, while the good I did\nwas voluntary.--I must see her, Josiah Cargill--I must see her before I\ndie--I shall never pray till I see her--I shall never profit by word of\ngodliness till I see her! If I cannot obtain the pardon of a worm like\nmyself, how can I hope for that of\"----\n\nShe started at these words with a faint scream; for slowly, and with a\nfeeble hand, the curtains of the bed opposite to the side at which\nCargill sat, were opened, and the figure of Clara Mowbray, her clothes\nand long hair drenched and dripping with rain, stood in the opening by\nthe bedside. The dying woman sat upright, her eyes starting from their\nsockets, her lips quivering, her face pale, her emaciated hands grasping\nthe bed-clothes, as if to support herself, and looking as much aghast as\nif her confession had called up the apparition of her betrayed friend.\n\n\"Hannah Irwin,\" said Clara, with her usual sweetness of tone, \"my early\nfriend--my unprovoked enemy!--Betake thee to Him who hath pardon for us\nall, and betake thee with confidence--for I pardon you as freely as if\nyou had never wronged me--as freely as I desire my own\npardon.--Farewell--Farewell!\"\n\nShe retired from the room, ere the clergyman could convince himself\nthat it was more than a phantom which he beheld. He ran down stairs--he\nsummoned assistants, but no one could attend his call; for the deep\nruckling groans of the patient satisfied every one that she was\nbreathing her last; and Mrs. Dods, with the maid-servant, ran into the\nbedroom, to witness the death of Hannah Irwin, which shortly after took\nplace.\n\nThat event had scarcely occurred, when the maid-servant who had been\nleft in the inn, came down in great terror to acquaint her mistress,\nthat a lady had entered the house like a ghost, and was dying in Mr.\nTyrrel's room. The truth of the story we must tell our own way.\n\nIn the irregular state of Miss Mowbray's mind, a less violent impulse\nthan that which she had received from her brother's arbitrary violence,\nadded to the fatigues, dangers, and terrors of her night-walk, might\nhave exhausted the powers of her body, and alienated those of her mind.\nWe have before said, that the lights in the clergyman's house had\nprobably attracted her attention, and in the temporary confusion of a\nfamily, never remarkable for its regularity, she easily mounted the\nstairs, and entered the sick chamber undiscovered, and thus overheard\nHannah Irwin's confession, a tale sufficient to have greatly aggravated\nher mental malady.\n\n[Illustration]\n\nWe have no means of knowing whether she actually sought Tyrrel, or\nwhether it was, as in the former case, the circumstance of a light still\nburning where all around was dark, that attracted her; but her next\napparition was close by the side of her unfortunate lover, then deeply\nengaged in writing, when something suddenly gleamed on a large,\nold-fashioned mirror, which hung on the wall opposite. He looked up, and\nsaw the figure of Clara, holding a light (which she had taken from the\npassage) in her extended hand. He stood for an instant with his eyes\nfixed on this fearful shadow, ere he dared turn round on the substance\nwhich was thus reflected. When he did so, the fixed and pallid\ncountenance almost impressed him with the belief that he saw a vision,\nand he shuddered when, stooping beside him, she took his hand. \"Come\naway!\" she said, in a hurried voice--\"Come away, my brother follows to\nkill us both. Come, Tyrrel, let us fly--we shall easily escape\nhim.--Hannah Irwin is on before--but, if we are overtaken, I will have\nno more fighting--you must promise me that we shall not--we have had\nbut too much of that--but you will be wise in future.\"\n\n\"Clara Mowbray!\" exclaimed Tyrrel. \"Alas! is it thus?--Stay--do not go,\"\nfor she turned to make her escape--\"stay--stay--sit down.\"\n\n\"I must go,\" she replied, \"I must go--I am called--Hannah Irwin is gone\nbefore to tell all, and I must follow. Will you not let me go?--Nay, if\nyou will hold me by force, I know I must sit down--but you will not be\nable to keep me for all that.\"\n\nA convulsion fit followed, and seemed, by its violence, to explain that\nshe was indeed bound for the last and darksome journey. The maid, who at\nlength answered Tyrrel's earnest and repeated summons, fled terrified at\nthe scene she witnessed, and carried to the Manse the alarm which we\nbefore mentioned.\n\nThe old landlady was compelled to exchange one scene of sorrow for\nanother, wondering within herself what fatality could have marked this\nsingle night with so much misery. When she arrived at home, what was her\nastonishment to find there the daughter of the house, which, even in\ntheir alienation, she had never ceased to love, in a state little short\nof distraction, and tended by Tyrrel, whose state of mind seemed scarce\nmore composed than that of the unhappy patient. The oddities of Mrs.\nDods were merely the rust which had accumulated upon her character, but\nwithout impairing its native strength and energy; and her sympathies\nwere not of a kind acute enough to disable her from thinking and acting\nas decisively as circumstances required.\n\n\"Mr. Tyrrel,\" she said, \"this is nae sight for men folk--ye maun rise\nand gang to another room.\"\n\n\"I will not stir from her,\" said Tyrrel--\"I will not remove from her\neither now, or as long as she or I may live.\"\n\n\"That will be nae lang space, Maister Tyrrel, if ye winna be ruled by\ncommon sense.\"\n\nTyrrel started up, as if half comprehending what she said, but remained\nmotionless.\n\n\"Come, come,\" said the compassionate landlady; \"do not stand looking on\na sight sair enough to break a harder heart than yours, hinny--your ain\nsense tells ye, ye canna stay here--Miss Clara shall be weel cared for,\nand I'll bring word to your room-door frae half-hour to half-hour how\nshe is.\"\n\nThe necessity of the case was undeniable, and Tyrrel suffered himself to\nbe led to another apartment, leaving Miss Mowbray to the care of the\nhostess and her female assistants. He counted the hours in an agony,\nless by the watch than by the visits which Mrs. Dods, faithful to her\npromise, made from interval to interval, to tell him that Clara was not\nbetter--that she was worse--and, at last, that she did not think she\ncould live over morning. It required all the deprecatory influence of\nthe good landlady to restrain Tyrrel, who, calm and cold on common\noccasions, was proportionally fierce and impetuous when his passions\nwere afloat, from bursting into the room, and ascertaining, with his own\neyes, the state of the beloved patient. At length there was a long\ninterval--an interval of hours--so long, indeed, that Tyrrel caught from\nit the flattering hope that Clara slept, and that sleep might bring\nrefreshment both to mind and body. Mrs. Dods, he concluded, was\nprevented from moving, for fear of disturbing her patient's slumber;\nand, as if actuated by the same feeling which he imputed to her, he\nceased to traverse his apartment, as his agitation had hitherto\ndictated, and throwing himself into a chair, forbore to move even a\nfinger, and withheld his respiration as much as possible, just as if he\nhad been seated by the pillow of the patient. Morning was far advanced,\nwhen his landlady appeared in his room with a grave and anxious\ncountenance.\n\n\"Mr. Tyrrel,\" she said, \"ye are a Christian man.\"\n\n\"Hush, hush, for Heaven's sake!\" he replied; \"you will disturb Miss\nMowbray.\"\n\n\"Naething will disturb her, puir thing,\" answered Mrs. Dods; \"they have\nmuckle to answer for that brought her to this!\"\n\n\"They have--they have indeed,\" said Tyrrel, striking his forehead; \"and\nI will see her avenged on every one of them!--Can I see her?\"\n\n\"Better not--better not,\" said the good woman; but he burst from her,\nand rushed into the apartment.\n\n\"Is life gone?--Is every spark extinct?\" he exclaimed eagerly to a\ncountry surgeon, a sensible man, who had been summoned from Marchthorn\nin the course of the night. The medical man shook his head--Tyrrel\nrushed to the bedside, and was convinced by his own eyes that the being\nwhose sorrows he had both caused and shared, was now insensible to all\nearthly calamity. He raised almost a shriek of despair, as he threw\nhimself on the pale hand of the corpse, wet it with tears, devoured it\nwith kisses, and played for a short time the part of a distracted\nperson. At length, on the repeated expostulation of all present, he\nsuffered himself to be again conducted to another apartment, the surgeon\nfollowing, anxious to give such sad consolation as the case admitted of.\n\n\"As you are so deeply concerned for the untimely fate of this young\nlady,\" he said, \"it may be some satisfaction to you, though a melancholy\none, to know, that it has been occasioned by a pressure on the brain,\nprobably accompanied by a suffusion; and I feel authorized in stating,\nfrom the symptoms, that if life had been spared, reason would, in all\nprobability, never have returned. In such a case, sir, the most\naffectionate relation must own, that death, in comparison to life, is a\nmercy.\"\n\n\"Mercy?\" answered Tyrrel; \"but why, then, is it denied to me?--I know--I\nknow!--My life is spared till I revenge her.\"\n\nHe started from his seat, and hurried eagerly down stairs. But, as he\nwas about to rush from the door of the inn, he was stopped by Touchwood,\nwho had just alighted from a carriage, with an air of stern anxiety\nimprinted on his features, very different from their usual expression.\n\"Whither would ye? Whither would ye?\" he said, laying hold of Tyrrel,\nand stopping him by force.\n\n\"For revenge--for revenge!\" said Tyrrel. \"Give way, I charge you, on\nyour peril!\"\n\n\"Vengeance belongs to God,\" replied the old man, \"and his bolt has\nfallen.--This way--this way,\" he continued, dragging Tyrrel into the\nhouse. \"Know,\" he said, so soon as he had led or forced him into a\nchamber, \"that Mowbray of St. Ronan's has met Bulmer within this half\nhour, and has killed him on the spot.\"\n\n\"Killed?--whom?\" answered the bewildered Tyrrel.\n\n\"Valentine Bulmer, the titular Earl of Etherington.\"\n\n\"You bring tidings of death to the house of death,\" answered Tyrrel;\n\"and there is nothing in this world left that I should live for!\"\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX.\n\nCONCLUSION.\n\n    Here come we to our close--for that which follows\n    Is but the tale of dull, unvaried misery.\n    Steep crags and headlong linns may court the pencil,\n    Like sudden haps, dark plots, and strange adventures;\n    But who would paint the dull and fog-wrapt moor,\n    In its long track of sterile desolation?\n\n_Old Play._\n\n\nWhen Mowbray crossed the brook, as we have already detailed, his mind\nwas in that wayward and uncertain state, which seeks something whereon\nto vent the self-engendered rage with which it labours, like a volcano\nbefore eruption. On a sudden, a shot or two, followed by loud voices and\nlaughter reminded him he had promised, at that hour, and in that\nsequestered place, to decide a bet respecting pistol-shooting, to which\nthe titular Lord Etherington, Jekyl, and Captain MacTurk, to whom such a\npastime was peculiarly congenial, were parties as well as himself. The\nprospect this recollection afforded him, of vengeance on the man whom he\nregarded as the author of his sister's wrongs, was, in the present state\nof his mind, too tempting to be relinquished; and, setting spurs to his\nhorse, he rushed through the copse to the little glade, where he found\nthe other parties, who, despairing of his arrival, had already begun\ntheir amusement. A jubilee shout was set up as he approached.\n\n\"Here comes Mowbray, dripping, by Cot, like a watering-pan,\" said\nCaptain MacTurk.\n\n\"I fear him not,\" said Etherington, (we may as well still call him so,)\n\"he has ridden too fast to have steady nerves.\"\n\n\"We shall soon see that, my Lord Etherington, or rather Mr. Valentine\nBulmer,\" said Mowbray, springing from his horse, and throwing the bridle\nover the bough of a tree.\n\n\"What does this mean, Mr. Mowbray?\" said Etherington, drawing himself\nup, while Jekyl and Captain MacTurk looked at each other in surprise.\n\n\"It means, sir, that you are a rascal and impostor,\" replied Mowbray,\n\"who have assumed a name to which you have no right.\"\n\n\"That, Mr. Mowbray, is an insult I cannot carry farther than this\nspot,\" said Etherington.\n\n\"If you had been willing to do so, you should have carried with it\nsomething still harder to be borne,\" answered Mowbray.\n\n\"Enough, enough, my good sir; no use in spurring a willing\nhorse.--Jekyl, you will have the kindness to stand by me in this\nmatter?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my lord,\" said Jekyl.\n\n\"And, as there seems to be no chance of taking up the matter amicably,\"\nsaid the pacific Captain MacTurk, \"I will be most happy, so help me, to\nassist my worthy friend, Mr. Mowbray of St. Ronan's, with my countenance\nand advice.--Very goot chance that we were here with the necessary\nweapons, since it would have been an unpleasant thing to have such an\naffair long upon the stomach, any more than to settle it without\nwitnesses.\"\n\n\"I would fain know first,\" said Jekyl, \"what all this sudden heat has\narisen about.\"\n\n\"About nothing,\" said Etherington, \"except a mare's nest of Mr.\nMowbray's discovering. He always knew his sister played the madwoman,\nand he has now heard a report, I suppose, that she has likewise in her\ntime played the ---- fool.\"\n\n\"O, crimini!\" cried Captain MacTurk, \"my good Captain, let us pe loading\nand measuring out--for, by my soul, if these sweetmeats be passing\nbetween them, it is only the twa ends of a hankercher than can serve the\nturn--Cot tamn!\"\n\nWith such friendly intentions, the ground was hastily meted out. Each\nwas well known as an excellent shot; and the Captain offered a bet to\nJekyl of a mutchkin of Glenlivat, that both would fall by the first\nfire. The event showed that he was nearly right; for the ball of Lord\nEtherington grazed Mowbray's temple, at the very second of time when\nMowbray's pierced his heart. He sprung a yard from the ground, and fell\ndown a dead man. Mowbray stood fixed like a pillar of stone, his arm\ndropped to his side, his hand still clenched on the weapon of death,\nreeking at the touch-hole and muzzle. Jekyl ran to raise and support his\nfriend, and Captain MacTurk, having adjusted his spectacles, stooped on\none knee to look him in the face. \"We should have had Dr. Quackleben\nhere,\" he said, wiping his glasses, and returning them to the shagreen\ncase, \"though it would have been only for form's sake--for he is as dead\nas a toor-nail, poor boy.--But come, Mowbray, my bairn,\" he said, taking\nhim by the arm, \"we must be ganging our ain gait, you and me, before\nwaur comes of it.--I have a bit powney here, and you have your horse\ntill we get to Marchthorn.--Captain Jekyl, I wish you a good morning.\nWill you have my umbrella back to the inn, for I surmeese it is going\nto rain?\"\n\nMowbray had not ridden a hundred yards with his guide and companion,\nwhen he drew his bridle, and refused to proceed a step farther, till he\nhad learned what was become of Clara. The Captain began to find he had a\nvery untractable pupil to manage, when, while they were arguing\ntogether, Touchwood drove past in his hack chaise. As soon as he\nrecognised Mowbray, he stopped the carriage to inform him that his\nsister was at the Aultoun, which he had learned from finding there had\nbeen a messenger sent from thence to the Well for medical assistance,\nwhich could not be afforded, the Esculapius of the place, Dr.\nQuackleben, having been privately married to Mrs. Blower on that\nmorning, by Mr. Chatterly, and having set out on the usual nuptial tour.\n\nIn return for this intelligence, Captain MacTurk communicated the fate\nof Lord Etherington. The old man earnestly pressed instant flight, for\nwhich he supplied at the same time ample means, engaging to furnish\nevery kind of assistance and support to the unfortunate young lady; and\nrepresenting to Mowbray, that if he staid in the vicinity, a prison\nwould soon separate them. Mowbray and his companion then departed\nsouthward upon the spur, reached London in safety, and from thence went\ntogether to the Peninsula, where the war was then at the hottest.\n\nThere remains little more to be told. Mr. Touchwood is still alive,\nforming plans which have no object, and accumulating a fortune, for\nwhich he has apparently no heir. The old man had endeavoured to fix this\ncharacter, as well as his general patronage, upon Tyrrel, but the\nattempt only determined the latter to leave the country; nor has he been\nsince heard of, although the title and estates of Etherington lie vacant\nfor his acceptance. It is the opinion of many, that he has entered into\na Moravian mission, for the use of which he had previously drawn\nconsiderable sums.\n\nSince Tyrrel's departure, no one pretends to guess what old Touchwood\nwill do with his money. He often talks of his disappointments, but can\nnever be made to understand, or at least to admit, that they were in\nsome measure precipitated by his own talent for intrigue and\nmanoeuvring. Most people think that Mowbray of St. Ronan's will be at\nlast his heir. That gentleman has of late shown one quality which\nusually recommends men to the favour of rich relations, namely, a close\nand cautious care of what is already his own. Captain MacTurk's military\nardour having revived when they came within smell of gunpowder, the old\nsoldier contrived not only to get himself on full pay, but to induce his\ncompanion to serve for some time as a volunteer. He afterwards obtained\na commission, and nothing could be more strikingly different than was\nthe conduct of the young Laird of St. Ronan's and of Lieutenant Mowbray.\nThe former, as we know, was gay, venturous, and prodigal; the latter\nlived on his pay, and even within it--denied himself comforts, and often\ndecencies, when doing so could save a guinea; and turned pale with\napprehension, if, on any extraordinary occasion, he ventured sixpence a\ncorner at whist. This meanness, or closeness of disposition, prevents\nhis holding the high character to which his bravery and attention to his\nregimental duties might otherwise entitle him. The same close and\naccurate calculation of pounds, shillings, and pence, marked his\ncommunications with his agent Meiklewham, who might otherwise have had\nbetter pickings out of the estate of St. Ronan's, which is now at nurse,\nand thriving full fast; especially since some debts, of rather an\nusurious character, have been paid up by Mr. Touchwood, who contented\nhimself with more moderate usage.\n\nOn the subject of this property, Mr. Mowbray, generally speaking, gave\nsuch minute directions for acquiring and saving, that his old\nacquaintance, Mr. Winterblossom, tapping his morocco snuff-box with the\nsly look which intimated the coming of a good thing, was wont to say,\nthat he had reversed the usual order of transformation, and was turned\ninto a grub after having been a butterfly. After all, this narrowness,\nthough a more ordinary modification of the spirit of avarice, may be\nfounded on the same desire of acquisition, which in his earlier days\nsent him to the gaming-table.\n\nBut there was one remarkable instance in which Mr. Mowbray departed from\nthe rules of economy, by which he was guided in all others. Having\nacquired, for a large sum of money, the ground which he had formerly\nfeued out for the erection of the hotel, lodging-houses, shops, &c., at\nSt. Ronan's Well, he sent positive orders for the demolition of the\nwhole, nor would he permit the existence of any house of entertainment\non his estate, except that in the Aultoun, where Mrs. Dods reigns with\nundisputed sway, her temper by no means improved either by time, or her\narbitrary disposition by the total absence of competition.\n\nWhy Mr. Mowbray, with his acquired habits of frugality, thus destroyed\na property which might have produced a considerable income, no one could\npretend to affirm. Some said that he remembered his own early follies;\nand others, that he connected the buildings with the misfortunes of his\nsister. The vulgar reported, that Lord Etherington's ghost had been seen\nin the ball-room, and the learned talked of the association of ideas.\nBut it all ended in this, that Mr. Mowbray was independent enough to\nplease himself, and that such was Mr. Mowbray's pleasure.\n\nThe little watering-place has returned to its primitive obscurity; and\nlions and lionesses, with their several jackals, blue surtouts, and\nbluer stockings, fiddlers and dancers, painters and amateurs, authors\nand critics, dispersed like pigeons by the demolition of a dovecot, have\nsought other scenes of amusement and rehearsal, and have deserted ST.\nRONAN'S WELL.[II-12]\n\nFOOTNOTE:\n\n[II-12] Note III.--Meg Dods.\n\n\n\n\nAUTHOR'S NOTES.\n\n\nNote I., p. 202.\n\nThere were several instances of this dexterity, but especially those\nwhich occurred in the celebrated case of Murdison and Millar, in 1773.\nThese persons, a sheep-farmer and his shepherd, settled in the vale of\nTweed, commenced and carried on for some time an extensive system of\ndevastation on the flocks of their neighbours. A dog belonging to Millar\nwas so well trained, that he had only to show him during the day the\nparcel of sheep which he desired to have; and when dismissed at night\nfor the purpose, Yarrow went right to the pasture where the flock had\nfed, and carried off the quantity shown him. He then drove them before\nhim by the most secret paths to Murdison's farm, where the dishonest\nmaster and servant were in readiness to receive the booty. Two things\nwere remarkable. In the first place, that if the dog, when thus\ndishonestly employed, actually met his master, he observed great caution\nin recognising him, as if he had been afraid of bringing him under\nsuspicion; secondly, that he showed a distinct sense that the illegal\ntransactions in which he was engaged were not of a nature to endure\ndaylight. The sheep which he was directed to drive, were often reluctant\nto leave their own pastures, and sometimes the intervention of rivers or\nother obstacles made their progress peculiarly difficult. On such\noccasions, Yarrow continued his efforts to drive his plunder forward,\nuntil the day began to dawn, a signal which, he conceived, rendered it\nnecessary for him to desert his spoil, and slink homeward by a\ncircuitous road. It is generally said this accomplished dog was hanged\nalong with his master; but the truth is, he survived him long, in the\nservice of a man in Leithen, yet was said afterwards to have shown\nlittle of the wonderful instinct exhibited in the employment of Millar.\n\nAnother instance of similar sagacity, a friend of mine discovered in a\nbeautiful little spaniel, which he had purchased from a dealer in the\ncanine race. When he entered a shop, he was not long in observing that\nhis little companion made it a rule to follow at some interval, and to\nestrange itself from his master so much as to appear totally unconnected\nwith him. And when he left the shop, it was the dog's custom to remain\nbehind him till it could find an opportunity of seizing a pair of\ngloves, or silk stockings, or some similar property, which it brought to\nits master. The poor fellow probably saved its life by falling into the\nhands of an honest man.\n\n\nNote II., p. 213.\n\nThe author has made an attempt in this character to draw a picture of\nwhat is too often seen, a wretched being whose heart becomes hardened\nand spited at the world, in which she is doomed to experience much\nmisery and little sympathy. The system of compulsory charity by poor's\nrates, of which the absolute necessity can hardly be questioned, has\nconnected with it on both sides some of the most odious and malevolent\nfeelings that can agitate humanity. The quality of true charity is not\nstrained. Like that of mercy, of which, in a large sense, it may be\naccounted a sister virtue, it blesses him that gives and him that takes.\nIt awakens kindly feelings both in the mind of the donor and in that of\nthe relieved object. The giver and receiver are recommended to each\nother by mutual feelings of good-will, and the pleasurable emotions\nconnected with the consciousness of a good action fix the deed in\nrecollection of the one, while a sense of gratitude renders it holy to\nthe other. In the legal and compulsory assessment for the proclaimed\nparish pauper, there is nothing of all this. The alms are extorted from\nan unwilling hand, and a heart which desires the annihilation, rather\nthan the relief, of the distressed object. The object of charity,\nsensible of the ill-will with which the pittance is bestowed, seizes on\nit as his right, not as a favour. The manner of conferring it being\ndirectly calculated to hurt and disgust his feelings, he revenges\nhimself by becoming impudent and clamorous. A more odious picture, or\nmore likely to deprave the feelings of those exposed to its influence,\ncan hardly be imagined; and yet to such a point have we been brought by\nan artificial system of society, that we must either deny altogether the\nright of the poor to their just proportion of the fruits of the earth,\nor afford them some means of subsistence out of them by the institution\nof positive law.\n\n\nNote III., p. 318.\n\n_Non omnis moriar._ Saint Ronan's, since this veracious history was\ngiven to the public, has revived as a sort of _alias_, or second title,\nto the very pleasant village of Inverleithen upon Tweed, where there is\na medicinal spring much frequented by visitors.

M. Collyer. The proof-sheets are in the possession of\nMr. Archibald Constable. The scene, of which a few lines remain in the\nauthorised texts, is that of Hannah Irwin's Confession to Josiah\nCargill.\n\n\"Oh, most unhappy woman,\" he said, \"what does your introduction prepare\nme to expect?\"\n\n\"Your expectation, be it ever so ominous, shall be fully satisfied. That\nBulmer, when he told you that a secret marriage was necessary to Miss\nMowbray's honour, thought that he was imposing on you.--But he told you\na fatal truth, so far as concerned Clara. She had indeed fallen, but\nBulmer was not her seducer--knew nothing of the truth of what he so\nstrongly asseverated.\"\n\n\"_He_ was not her lover, then?--And how came he, then, to press to marry\nher?--Or, how came you\"----\n\n\"Hear me--but question not.--Bulmer had gained the advantage over me\nwhich he pretended to have had over Clara. From that moment my\ncompanion's virtue became at once the object of my envy and hatred: yet,\nso innocent were the lovers, that, despite of the various arts which I\nused to entrap them, they remained guiltless until the fatal evening\nwhen Clara met Tyrrel for the last time ere he removed from the\nneighbourhood--and then the devil and Hannah Irwin triumphed. Much there\nwas of remorse--much of resolutions of separation until the Church\nshould unite them--but these only forwarded my machinations--for I was\ndetermined she should wed Bulmer, not Tyrrel.\"\n\n\"Wretch!\" exclaimed the clergyman: \"and had you not, then, done enough?\nWhy did you expose the paramour of one brother to become the wife of\nanother?\"\n\nShe paused, and answered sullenly, \"I had my reasons--Bulmer had treated\nme with scorn. He told me plainly that he used me but as a\nstepping-stone to his own purposes: and that these finally centred in\nwedding Clara.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.\n\nThe Foundation's principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\ninformation can be found at the Foundation's web site and official\npage at http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nFor additional contact information:\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\nTo donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":503,"split":"train"}
