{"ori_id":"7e7ade00a17d1645761336bc492e7000c60d38ac","title":"The Squaw Man (play)","context":"The Squaw Man (play)\n The first act of the play is set in England in the 1800s. The lead character is Capt. James Wynnegate. His older cousin, heir Henry Wynnegate, Earl of Kerhill, steals from the family trust fund and speculates heavily. Henry loses the fortune, causing them to default on a commitment to an orphans' home.\nCapt. Wynnegate is in love with Henry's wife, Diana. She does not love her husband and returns the affection of the captain. As the money has been lost, Capt. Wynnegate agrees to leave England and take the blame (see remittance man). He is then accused of being a thief, which allows Henry to avoid suspicion and protects the name and the reputation of his wife.\nHe goes to the Wild West of Montana, where he buys the Red Butte Ranch and makes a name for himself under the alias Jim Carson. In the second act, several years later, Henry and Diana show up. The bad man, Cash Hawkins, is about to shoot Jim when the Ute Indian maiden, Nat-u-ritch, shoots Hawkins from the sidelines and saves Jim's life.\nNat-u-ritch, who is the daughter of Chief Tab-y-wana, rescues Jim several more times, it is revealed through exposition in the third act. They fall in love and have a son, Little Hal. Jim marries Nat-u-ritch. The marriage between a white man in his social position and an Indian woman is deemed scandalous.\nBy the fourth act, more time has passed and Diana comes West again with news that Henry has died. The English solicitor shows up and persuades Jim that Hal should be taken to England and raised as the heir to the large Wynnegate estate. Jim agrees to send the boy away.\nApparently, Jim and his social group believe it is his right to take the child away from his mother. Nat-u-ritch's father, Chief Tab-y-wana's resolve is not much different. At the first sign of disobedience the chief voices his sentiment where a woman is concerned. \"If she will not obey, beat her. If she disobeys again, kill her.\"\nKnowing that she is going to lose her son, and hearing that she will be arrested for killing Hawkins, Nat-u-ritch commits suicide. Now Jim is free to be with his English woman. The play concludes with the Indian chief standing stoically erect with the pathetically limp figure of the little mother squaw, his daughter, lying across his outstretched arms, the reversal of the usual Pieta.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf                             THE SQUAW MAN\n\n\n\n\nThis ebook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and\nmost other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions\nwhatsoever.

He stood in the centre of the fragrant\ngarden and watched the glory of color suffusing the Surrey hills towards\nthe west.  With a sigh he turned away and walked to the house.\n\n\"Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Diana?\" he called, as he came from the garden through the\ncasement-window of the library.\n\n\"Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0094why, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in bed an hour ago, I should hope,\" replied his aunt,\nLady Elizabeth Kerhill. \"She and Mabel went with Bates to see the\ndecorations and then said good-night.  Surely you didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect me to\nallow the children to stay up for the ball?\"\n\nMabel was her daughter; Diana Marjoribanks was a young girl of thirteen,\nwho had come to visit her.\n\n\"Poor imps! they were so excited all day, and followed me about the\ngun-room where I was doing some packing.  They wanted me to coax you to\nallow them to see the ball, and the tenantry welcome Henry to-night.\"\n\nLady Kerhill elevated her eyebrows in questioning amazement at Jim, as\nshe nervously twisted the lace of her gown, and with an impatient\ngesture motioned the subject aside.  She was a tall, angular woman, with\na profile like the head on a bronze coin; there was a suggestion of the\neagle in her personality, and by her friends she was likened to the\nfamous Sarah Churchill, the first Duchess of Marlborough.\n\nTo-night her face showed that anxious thoughts were crowding in on her\nas she apprehensively watched the big, carved oak door leading into the\nhall. Jim knew his aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s firmness of character, and as silence followed\nhis words, he feared further discussion was useless; but the wistful\nfaces of the children at tea-time in the nursery, as they coaxed him to\nplead for them to see the fun, made him venture a final appeal.\n\n\"You know, Aunt, Sir Charles brought Di over to stay with Mabel so that\nshe might see the festivities and incidentally say good-bye to me, so\nyou might turn angel and let Diana dance once with me at the very\nbeginning of the ball.  I sha\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see my little playfellow for ages, you\nknow.\"\n\nA sound from outside held Lady Elizabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention more intently than\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pleading words.  He crossed to her in the window-enclosure and\nlaid his hand caressingly on her shoulder.\n\n\"The Colonel wired me that we were leaving Paddington at nine to-morrow\nmorning, and India is a long way off, Auntie mine.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" answered Lady Elizabeth, as she rose from the deep\nwindow-seat.  \"You are almost twenty, and Diana is only a babe\u00e2\u0080\u0094isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nshe, Henry?\"  She glanced up and appealed to the young man who rather\nnoisily entered the library.\n\n\"Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a babe?  Diana?  Why, mater, she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a little witch, and I promised\nher I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d let her see the illuminations at ten and then old Burrow should\ncarry her off to bed.\"\n\nHenry Wynnegate, seventh Earl of Kerhill, dropped into a great settle\nclose to the fire.  The ball was for the tenantry in celebration of his\nreturn, after five years\u00e2\u0080\u0099 absence with his regiment.  He was a tall,\nheavy-set young soldier of seven-and-twenty, with the famous Wynnegate\nbeauty, but it was marred by the shifting expression of his rather\ndeep-set eyes and the heavy lines about his mouth.  Self was his god: it\nshowed in every expression of his face and in every action of his life.\n\nJim Wynnegate, his cousin, the son of the younger brother of the late\nEarl, Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, turned from the window as Henry entered.  In the\nyoung boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face\u00e2\u0080\u0094for he seemed younger than his years\u00e2\u0080\u0094one could easily\ntrace the family resemblance; but Jim, with his great, clean spirit\nshining in his honest gray eyes, invited confidence and won it, from a\nmongrel dog to a superior officer.  He was taller than Henry, and as\nslim as a young sapling.  The delicate, sensitive mouth was balanced by\na strong chin.\n\nIn the oak-lined room, grown almost black with age, the candle-lights\nflickering in the heavy brass sconces, stood these three last\ndescendants of a great family. The Earl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother, Dick Wynnegate, had\nrun away with the daughter of an impecunious colonel.  A few years\nlater, while on service in India, he was shot, and the young wife lived\nonly to bring the tiny boy Jim home and to leave him with her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbrother.  Even then the fortunes of the Wynnegates were somewhat\nimpaired, but the old Earl had taken the boy to his heart, and on his\ndeath had confided him to his wife to share their fortune with his son\nHenry.  His last words were, \"Be good to poor Dick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy.\"  The estates\nwere entailed, so no provision could be made by him for Jim, but Lady\nKerhill, in her cold, just fashion, had tried to make Dick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy happy.\n\nDeep in his heart, Jim remembered the years that followed; remembered\nthe selfish domination of the elder boy; remembered the blind adoration\nof his aunt for her son, the bearer of the torch, who was to carry on\nthe golden light of the house of Kerhill.  In the Anglo-Saxon idolatry\nof the Countess of Kerhill for the male of the family, all the old\ntraditions and beliefs were justified.  Her boy\u00e2\u0080\u0094-the man-child who was\nto be the head of the house\u00e2\u0080\u0094was her obsession. The tiny, flower-like\ngirl who came shortly before her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, learned soon to turn\nto Cousin Jim for comfort when her brother carelessly crushed her little\njoys, as he selfishly planned and fought for his own gratification.\n\nInstinctively Jim watched his aunt, who, at Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s word, had started to\nmove towards him.\n\n\"Of course, if you care to go and fetch Diana, I shall be happy,\" Lady\nKerhill said.\n\nHenry lounged back in his chair.  \"Well, if I forget, Jim can remember\nfor me\u00e2\u0080\u0094eh, Jim?\"\n\nLady Kerhill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face became grave as she leaned over Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s chair and\nclosely studied the flushed face.  She found there confirmation of the\nfear that had preyed on her mind for the past half-hour.\n\n\"Oh, Henry, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve broken your word,\" she whispered.\n\nThe reckless challenge of Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dark eyes as he moved impatiently in\nhis chair was his only answer. Then in a burst of ill-concealed\nresentment he rose: \"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t nag, mother.\"\n\nHe swayed slightly as he crossed to the open casement. As Jim turned to\nhim, he sullenly pushed him aside.\n\n\"And don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you preach,\" he muttered, as he started for the garden.\n\nJim quickly caught him by the shoulder, \"Pull yourself together, Henry.\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eight o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock and the people are gathering in the park.\"\n\nHenry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only reply was a snarl as he disappeared in the shadow of the\ntrees.\n\nThe broad window opened level on an Old World garden that led into the\ngreat park beyond.  The late twilight of the July night was bathing park\nand garden in a curious, unearthly light which made strange spectres of\nthe slowly waving yew-trees.  The scent of the rose-bushes, the call of\nthe late nightingale to his mate, and the ghostly sundial,\nsentinel-like, guarding the old place, made a fitting environment for\nMaudsley Towers.\n\nOn a slight hill beyond the park, Jim could see the ruins of the famous\nNorman church.  To the right, at the farther end of the garden, was the\nFairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Corner. There among the trees the fairies of the field were\nsupposed to sleep, and to listen to and grant the requests of the\nchildren, who had the courage to venture to them at even-tide.  Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nthoughts were busy to-night; all the old memories seemed to tug at his\nheartstrings.\n\nHe had carried Diana Marjoribanks there on her first visit to the\nTowers.  She was six then and he was twelve.  She had clung to him and\nhid her head on his shoulder\u00e2\u0080\u0094the tiny body had stiffened with fear\u00e2\u0080\u0094as\nthey made their way to the dark enclosure of the trees.  He could still\nhear her prayer.\n\n\"Dear Fairy, please make Henry kinder to poor Jim, poor Mabel, and poor\nme!\"\n\nEven then, Henry had been the little tyrant of the Towers.\n\nAnd yet to-night Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wish, as of old, was law to his mother.  She\nconceded Diana to him at his first careless request, although in all\nprobability he would forget the longing child in the nursery\u00e2\u0080\u0094forget his\npromise to give her pleasure, as he had forgotten so often when he was a\nboy.\n\nJim roused himself; as he turned to Lady Elizabeth he caught a glimpse\nof her with the mask off, the bitter disappointment of the mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nheart showing in every line of her proud face.  He crossed to her, but\nthe sound of carriage-wheels turning into the driveway heralded the\napproach of the first arrivals, and before Jim could speak the doors\nwere thrown open to the guests.\n\nLady Elizabeth gave one look of appeal to Jim. It said: \"Help Henry and\nme!\"\n\nUp-stairs in the right wing of the old house, a tall, slender child\ncrouched close to the nursery window. She had crept from her cot, and,\nwrapped in a coverlet, waited, and clung to the belief that Henry would\ncome for her.  Jim had said he would try, but Henry had promised.  She\nwas old enough to know that what Henry desired he obtained.  Her little\nface was pressed closer and closer to the window as she listened to the\nswelling music and saw the guests thronging towards the park.  Carriage\nafter carriage brought its load of finery, until the child fancied that\nthe entire county must be gathered below.  She could see through the\nclimbing roses down into the library, which jutted out at a sharp angle\nalmost opposite to the nursery window.  But of Jim or Henry she could\ncatch no glimpse.\n\nThe stars began to creep out and blink at the tiny figure in the\nwindow-seat.  Gradually the entire house grew quiet.  All\u00e2\u0080\u0094even the\nservants\u00e2\u0080\u0094had joined the revelry in the park.\n\nThe music crashed louder.  Fiery showers of illumination could be seen\nshooting and flaming into the sky.  It grew cold.  Tighter she drew the\ncoverlet and held closer the small puppy that nestled warm in her arms\nand slept.  In the adjoining room Mabel, Lady Kerhill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s little daughter,\nlay fast asleep.\n\n\"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last night.  I must say good-bye,\" the child whispered to\nthe fleecy white bundle in her arms. \"I must keep awake and say\ngood-bye.\"\n\nFainter grew the music, darker the sky, and heavier the curved eyelids.\nSlowly, with a sigh the child slipped to the floor, and the brown head\npillowed itself on the cushioned window-seat.  Diana slept.\n\nIn the park, the tenantry, eager to meet their young master, were\nshouting themselves hoarse.  A speech of welcome followed the dazzling\nilluminations.  Over it all, Lady Elizabeth, with Sir Charles\nMarjoribanks, presided.\n\nDiana and her father lived on a neighboring estate, and Sir Charles had\ncome to-night to rejoice with his old friend on the return of her son.\nSir Charles was a man of slender physique, with a gentle, winning\nmanner; extremely delicate in health, he led for the most part a\nsecluded life, and since the death of his wife, at Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s birth, went\nlittle into the social world.  Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s childhood had been almost as\nlonely as Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had been in his aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s home.  To-night Sir Charles\ndelighted in seeing the house of Wynnegate honored.  He scarcely noted\nthe reckless demeanor and wild spirits of Henry as unusual; only for Jim\nand Lady Elizabeth was it a night of anxiety.  Never for a moment did\nHenry escape Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s watchful eyes; slip after slip made by Henry was\ncovered by Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tact and thoughtfulness, and with simple dignity he\ncarried the night to success.  Only when he stood aside and saw Henry\nreceive the demonstrations of the county and tenantry did the bitterness\nof his position force itself upon him.  Not once did Henry remember his\npromise to the child waiting for him.  Jim remembered; but the look of\nappeal from his aunt, and the sullen defiance of Henry, kept him close\nto his cousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side.\n\nThe final bars of the last dance were dying away and the ball was\ndrawing to its brilliant end.  In the east, a pale streak of light was\nbeginning to show over the horizon.  Sir Charles, half an hour before,\nhad gone to his room.  Exhausted by the long evening\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anxiety and late\nfestivities, Lady Kerhill forgot that Jim was to leave early in the\nmorning and that she would not see him again, and had retired to her own\napartment.  In the great hall, tired and excited groups of guests were\nsaying good-night.\n\n\"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good-bye for Jim,\" Sir John Applegate, Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cousin, called as\nthe last carriage drove away.\n\nA half-whimsical smile played over Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face. Then some one remembered\nthat he was leaving England.  As he turned from the door, he met the\neyes of his cousin fastened on him, all the latent rebellion rising to\nthe surface.  Henry Kerhill was sober enough to know that Jim had\nwatched and guarded him through the entire night, and had stood between\nhim and disgrace.  As he leaned against the tall mantel, the bitter\nconsciousness that the young boy had proved himself of fine mettle, ate\nlike acid into his feverish brain.  He dug his hands deep into his\npockets, then with a lurch he pulled himself together. Without a word he\nturned, crossed to the twisted staircase, and grasping the oak rails,\nslowly ascended. From the landing came the slam of a heavy door, and Jim\nknew that he was alone.\n\nSo this was the end.  The striking of the bell in the church-tower\nreminded him that it was now four o\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock and that he was to leave at\nsix.  His luggage had been sent on ahead the previous day.  He changed\nquickly, without disturbing the tired servants, and in half an hour was\nready to walk to the station.  As he came down the broad staircase,\nlined with portraits of the ancestors of the house of Wynnegate, a\nslight noise in the corridor leading off from the broad landing\nattracted him.  Before he could turn, a low voice called:\n\n\"Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jim!\"\n\nIt was Diana.  Standing there in the dim light of the corridor, she made\nan entrancing picture.  With the parted hair falling away from the low\nbrow, around the oval face, and the far-apart blue-black eyes, she\nlooked like the child Madonna of Rosetti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \"Annunciation.\"  The coverlet\nwas drawn close about her, the puppy still hidden under its folds.\n\n\"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Di, Jim,\" she whispered as she hurried to him.  \"I waited and\nwaited for you\u00e2\u0080\u0094I knew you were going away and I wanted to say good-bye.\nBurrow promised that she would let me see you, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fast asleep,\nand so is Mabel.  I tried to wake them but I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.\"  The little\nfigure cuddled into his arms.\n\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart was very full as he looked at the frail child in the early\ndawn, the shadows of a restless night showing on her delicately modelled\nface. He drew her into a window-enclosure, and wrapping the heavy\ncurtains about her, held her fast.\n\n\"Say something,\" the sweet voice coaxed.  \"I shall miss you so and wait\nfor you to come back.  You will come back, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\"\n\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only answer was to press the little head close to his heart.  In\nall the great house, she alone had cared to say good-bye\u00e2\u0080\u0094to wish him in\nher child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way godspeed.\n\n\"See,\" Diana continued as she opened her arms, \"here is something for\nyou to take away with you, so that you sha\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be lonely any more.\"  She\nopened her arms and held up the soft roll of fur with its blinking eyes\nand pink-tipped nose.\n\n\"Di, dear Di,\" Jim whispered, as he patted the towsled hair.\n\nQuite seriously her big eyes searched Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face to be sure that her\ngift truly won approval.\n\nThe church clock boomed the hour of five.  Jim hurriedly rose and\nslipped the dog into his coat-pocket.\n\n\"Good-bye, Di, and God bless you!\"\n\nShe clung quietly to him with her arms tight around his neck for a long\ntime; then the little face quivered, and in a burst of tears she sank\nback among the cushions of the window-seat.  Jim hesitated a moment,\nthen with a final pat on the dear head, hurriedly reached the doorway\nand was out on the high-road. From a turn at the top of the common he\ncaught a last glimpse of the great house, and in the big window of the\nhall could see the faint outline of the white figure still huddled among\nthe cushions.\n\nAll the suppression of the past days gave way. With a cry, Jim threw\nhimself down on the damp ground and convulsive sobs shook his body.  It\nhad all been his\u00e2\u0080\u0094his home, his country\u00e2\u0080\u0094and he was leaving it without a\nfriend, without a loving hand or voice to cheer him.\n\nHe suddenly felt a damp nose thrust into his hand, and a soft tongue\nbegan to lap his face as though in sympathy.  The tiny puppy had fallen\nfrom his pocket and crawled on to his shoulder.  He rose to his feet and\npicked up the fluffy ball; something in the round, pulpy mass made him\nlaugh.\n\n\"So I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve found a friend, have I?  Is that what you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to tell\nme?\"\n\nThe dog gave a faint yelp in reply and began to lick his hand.  Holding\nthe dog close to him, Jim walked on, all the boy in him welling up to\nmeet the promise of the new day.  Suddenly he stopped as he neared the\nstation platform, and stroking gently the soft fur, he whispered:\n\n\"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll call you Di.\"\n\n\n\n\n                              *CHAPTER II*\n\n\nIt was London in full swing.  A wild April shower had sprung up and was\nquickly driving people into the shelter of passing hansoms.  There was a\nsudden exodus from the park of gayly gowned women, hurrying to their\nwaiting carriages.  Bewildered nurses gathered their young charges into\nprotecting corners.  Only a few minutes before it had been radiant\nsunshine.  Open high-swung see-victorias, with their powdered, liveried\nmen on the boxes, and unprotected occupants driving from a royal house\nto a ducal assemblage, were caught in the congested mass of hansoms,\ntop-heavy \u00e2\u0080\u0099busses, and passing carts. Stalwart, blue-coated giants were\ntrying to stem the rush and scramble.\n\nDiana crossed from the couch where she had been sitting to the open\nwindow.  In a week\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time she was to be married.  She held a note in her\nhand, which had just come by messenger.  It was from Henry.  He could\nnot take her to Ranelagh as he had planned, he wrote.  Unexpected\nbusiness had arisen, but he would see her later in the evening.\n\nThe room in which Diana stood faced Hyde Park. The house was one of\nthose built a century ago by the mad Duke of Delford, and was famous for\nthe purity of its architecture.  On this spring day the front looked\nlike a hanging garden, so abundant and exquisite were the large boxes of\ntrailing flowers. The room with its Adam ceiling and mantel, its crimson\nbrocade curtains against the pale-cream walls, its rare specimens of\nSheraton and Chippendale and precious bits of china, made a harmonious\nsetting for Diana in her dove-colored gown.  Bowls of yellow jonquils\nand daffodils gleamed like golden bits of imprisoned sunlight on\nslender-legged tables.\n\nDiana was alone.  Lady Dillingham, her aunt, and the mistress of the\nPark Lane House was confined to her room with a sharp attack of gout.\nFrom the window looking out across the park, the rain glinted like a\nfine sheet of steel.  It beat down the great beds of flaming hyacinths\nand daffodils that lined the park walk with their glory of purple and\nyellow.  The blue-and-white fleecy sky of a past half-hour now hung over\nthe town like a dirty ship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sail, with puffing, dun-colored clouds\nsweeping past.\n\nDiana half consciously watched the amusing scurry of the passers-by.\nThrough the long, open windows protected by a projecting balcony she\ncould hear the splashing of the rain against the pavement.  The\nconfusion of carriages began to straighten itself out. The hurrying\ncrowds disappeared as though swallowed up in the drenched ground.  What\nhad been a fantastic, brilliantly colored panorama was now a desolate\nspace.\n\nAs Diana stood there, a rising resentment at the broken promise filled\nher mind.  It was not because of the disappointment.  So often, at the\nlast moment, her plans had been changed by Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to keep his\nengagements with her.  A sharp gust of wind blew its damp air into the\nroom and made her shiver.  She closed the window and walked to the open\nlog fire.  The spring days of an English climate still permitted this\nluxury within doors.  As she sat before the hearth, the letter still in\nher hand hanging listlessly by her side, the door quietly opened and her\nfather entered.  On the previous day he had come up from the country to\njoin Diana, who was visiting his sister while the necessary wedding\npreparations were being completed.  The passing years had greatly aged\nSir Charles.  The delicate, high-bred face had grown more spiritual, and\nhe seemed further aloof from material influences.\n\nWith a pang Diana noticed the change.  She rose and crossed to him, her\ntall figure hovering protectingly over the old man.  The maternal\ninstinct was deeply embedded in Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nature.  Quite tenderly he took\nthe young face in his withered but exquisitely modelled hands and kissed\nher.\n\n\"Alone, dear?\" he said.  \"I thought Henry was to take you to join some\npeople at Ranelagh.\"\n\n\"Henry has just sent me word that he is unexpectedly detained in the\ncity.\"\n\nSomething in her tone made Sir Charles wince.\n\nShe was very beautiful, in a curious, contradictory way.  Her tender,\nserious eyes suggested the Madonna, but her arched, full mouth made her\na half Venus.  More than tall, there was in the lithe, girlish figure an\nembodiment of latent reliance and vitality. Her usually calm face was\ndisturbed at the moment by a look of intense perplexity.  It seemed as\nthough she were vainly trying to combat her doubts.\n\nShe stood for a moment irresolute, then in a burst of tears she slipped\ndown beside the big chair in which her father sat.\n\n\"I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t marry Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\" she sobbed, as she hid her face in her\nhands.\n\nFor a moment Sir Charles was startled; then, smiling at what he divined\nto be a lover\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quarrel, he patiently patted the bent head as though\nhumoring a wayward child.  Absorbed in his own narrow life, he had no\nknowledge of men, and to him Henry Wynnegate was an ideal match for his\nmotherless girl.\n\nHe had known the late Earl well, and in the reflected glory of the\nparents he saw the son.  His heart was set on seeing Diana safely moored\nin the house of Wynnegate and the brilliant position hers, which she\ncould assume as the Countess of Kerhill. These tears, of course, were\nthe foolish outcome of the afternoon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disappointment.  He let her have\nher cry out; then gradually drew the slender hands from her face.\n\n\"You are unreasonable, my child,\" he began. \"Surely you can hope for no\nbetter husband than the son of my late friend.  Why, I have known him\nfrom childhood.  Think,\" he went on, \"of his career as a soldier; of the\nrespect of his tenantry; of his position in the world.\"  He forgot the\ndominance of Lady Elizabeth, who, by her plans and generalship had\ncommanded all these attributes for her son.  \"With his knowledge of life\nand the future assured him,\" he continued, \"he can give you all that so\nfar has been denied to you.  What more can you desire, my dear?\"\n\nDiana raised her tear-stained face and listened.\n\nHe drew her close to him, his feeble body vibrating with sudden emotion\nas he said, \"I am very feeble\u00e2\u0080\u0094far older than my years, and I long to see\nyou safely placed.\"  He waited a moment as though expecting a reply, but\nthere was no answer to his appeal.  \"We are poor, Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0094very poor.  I\nhave carried a heavy burden for years.  This marriage will make me\nsupremely happy; it will make my remaining days peaceful.\"  He paused.\n\"You can trust me, dear, in this matter.  Say that you can.\"\n\nSomething in the tense, pathetic face forced back Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words of\nopposition.  Perhaps she was wrong, There was no tangible reason for\nthis rebellion that her perplexed mind could grasp.  Her father, so\ngentle, so wise, so loving, could not be doubted. Sir Charles watched\nher eagerly.  He loved her, but in his short-sighted desire for her\nhappiness he failed to see the depths of her troubled heart.  Almost\nconvinced that her frightened instinct was wrong, Diana rose, and, with\na gentle pressure of her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand, yielded to his importunities.\nTactfully, and in silence, Sir Charles accepted her consent.\n\nA strained pause followed.  Sir Charles reflectively sank into the\ncushions of his high-backed chair.  He was sure that Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outburst\nwas mere nervousness; it was often so with young, inexperienced girls\nbefore marriage.  The excitement of the London life was a great fatigue\nto him.  Even the muffled, vibrating roar that half penetrated into the\ndwellings of Mayfair, told on his sensitive nature.  He closed his eyes.\n\nDiana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s girlhood had been singularly isolated from the world.  Shortly\nafter Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure for India, she had been sent abroad to a school on\nthe Continent. She had usually spent the summers with her father at some\npeaceful, out of the way corner.  Her education completed, she had\nreturned during the April previous, to the quiet life of her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhome.\n\nThere followed the lonely weeks with her awakening womanhood crying out\nfor comprehension.  Then one day Henry Wynnegate returned to the Towers.\nShe had only a vague memory of the subsequent days of amusement that\npassed so quickly.  All that her youth and gayety had so long desired\nwas given her. She was unconsciously swept on by the passion of Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlove and could hardly recall when she promised to be his wife.  That was\nin the autumn.\n\nAt the beginning of the season she was presented at court.  Her youth\nand beauty made a sensation, and her marriage was arranged to take place\nwithin a month.\n\nEager to grasp the bloom of the fresh flower he had plucked, Henry would\ntolerate no delay.  Backed by the dominant influence of his mother, who\nin Diana saw not only the gratification of Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desires, but a\ngracious bearer of his name, and, with the persuasion of Sir Charles,\nDiana acquiesced to an early marriage. She was in love with love, not\nwith the man, and her loveliness and the purity of her fresh young soul\nmade her idealize the best of Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shifting, many-sided nature.\n\nSir Charles dozed peacefully.  Diana, with feverish cheeks and burning\neyes, longed to escape from the warm room.  Through the closed windows\nshe could see that the rain had ceased.  She wanted to be alone, to calm\nthe battling emotions of the past hour.  As she tiptoed to the door, it\nwas thrown open, and the Countess of Kerhill and Lady Mabel Wynnegate\nwere announced.\n\nSir Charles aroused, rose quickly from his chair to greet the visitors.\n\n\"My dear,\" Lady Kerhill began, as she entered the room and embraced\nDiana, \"we are going to ask you for our tea at once if you will take\npity on us. Such an afternoon!  We were obliged to turn back from\nRanelagh because of the storm.  Fortunately we had a closed carriage,\nbut Mabel and I were so anxious to know whether you and Henry had\nstarted before the shower sprang up\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094with a quick look of surprise about\nthe room, she exclaimed, \"Why, where is Henry?\"\n\nDiana rang the bell for tea.\n\n\"I had a note from Henry, dear Lady Elizabeth, saying he was detained by\nsome unexpected business.\"\n\nSir Charles noticed with great satisfaction Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s superb control.  Her\nrebellious mood, as he surmised, had been a mere whim.\n\nFor a moment a half-frightened look came into Lady Elizabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes.\nShe was never quite sure of Henry, but even to herself she never\nadmitted it.  She had cast him for a role that he neither suggested nor\nattempted to play, but she never flinched before the duty of wilfully\nblinding herself to these truths.  Her love and her belief would win,\nand out of it all would be created the son she so desired Henry to\nbe\u00e2\u0080\u0094that was her unconscious prayer.  She threw off the moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s anxiety.\n\n\"No doubt it is a busy week for Henry,\" she said. She crossed to a chair\nnear the fire, and with the announcement of tea began to gossip with Sir\nCharles. Mabel moved close to Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side at the tea-table. She had\ngrown into a fairy-like creature, with exquisite, youthful coloring.\nVery shy and utterly subordinate to her mother and brother, she lavished\nupon Diana a great affection in return for her sympathy.  She stole shy\nglances at Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unusual color, as the latter poured the tea\nmechanically, but joined little in the conversation.  Diana caught\nMabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes wonderingly fastened upon her.  She could no longer endure\nthe close room.\n\n\"I must get a breath of air.  Can Mabel go with me?\" she said, as she\nrose from her untouched tea.\n\nSir Charles was explaining to Lady Elizabeth some details of the\nprevious night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rowdy conduct at the House.  They both paused for a\nmoment.\n\n\"Do take a turn with Mabel in the park,\" said Sir Charles.  \"It will\nrefresh you.\"\n\n\"Remember we are due at the opera to-night,\" Lady Elizabeth said, as she\nrose.  Sir Charles protested.  \"But it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just why I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going myself,\"\nLady Elizabeth confessed.  \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll send the carriage back for Mabel.\"\n\nA few minutes later Diana and Mabel entered the park.  The pungent smell\nof the damp earth filled the air.  Great crimson and yellow pools of\ncolor dotted the ground; they were the battered-down blossoms of the\nafternoon.  Some stronger plants than the others were lifting their\nswaying stems. The paths were covered with bruised leaves, and from the\nbranches came the drip-drip of the gleaming rain-drops.  At times under\ninterlaced branches it seemed as though the storm still continued, so\nheavy was the splashing of the drenched trees.  The usually crowded\nmeeting-ground of fashion was practically deserted; even the guards had\nnot left their corners of refuge.  Here and there a stray gardener in a\nby-path was pityingly regarding his damaged beds.\n\nThe fresh, wet air blew against Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face and calmed her troubled\nspirit.  Mabel linked her arm through Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s: neither spoke.  On and on\nthey walked, in and out of deserted side-paths, until a turn in the road\nbrought them opposite to the Serpentine Bridge, and they faced the\npublic driveway of the park.  A gust of wind blew across the ground a\ndeluge of broken boughs; it caused them to hesitate on the edge of the\ncrossing.  Mabel started forward as a cab dashed towards them at a\ntremendous speed.\n\n\"Why, Di, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Henry in that hansom,\" Mabel gasped, as she blew a\ntangle of loosened hair out of her eyes.\n\nBut Diana could only see the occupant nearest to her in the cab\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was a\nwoman with a strangely interesting foreign face.\n\n\"Nonsense,\" she answered, as she held firm the wind-blown hat.  \"Henry\nis in the city.  You are mistaken, dear.\"\n\nAs she spoke the storm began afresh.  The wind blew the sodden blossom\nleaves and broken branches into a hurricane cloud around them.  Grasping\nMabel by the hand, Diana made her way against the violence of the wind\nand finally reached the entrance to the park.  In the rush of keen air\nand the fight against it, everything else was forgotten.  They quickly\nreached the house, and Diana saw Mabel drive away in the shelter of the\nwaiting carriage.  A few minutes later she was in her own room.\n\nShe loosened her long, brown hair, and kneeling before the glowing fire\nheld the wet coils to its warmth. On her bed lay a gown to be worn that\nnight, and the light from the fire cast a delicate sheen over its folds.\nIt flickered and blazed with merry bursts of flame, lighting up the\nold-fashioned chintz draperies of the quaintly furnished room.  Through\nthe closed window she could hear the faint splutter of the rain on the\ncasement.  As she leaned against the tall chair close to the fireplace,\na soft, warm languor stole over her and the tension of her mind relaxed.\nThe beauty of her present life stretched out innumerable magic wands\nthat lulled into insensibility the frightened thoughts of the afternoon.\nSoothed by the warmth and comfort of the room after the fatigue of her\nwalk against the gale in the park, she abandoned herself to pleasant,\nintangible dreams.  A knock at the door aroused her.\n\nIt was her aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s maid, who carried a large box of flowers.  Diana\nopened them; they were from Henry. Again they reiterated his apologies\nfor the afternoon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disappointment.  The perfume of the gardenias filled\nthe room as she sank into a chair before her dressing-table and buried\nher face in the masses of delicate blossoms.  The quiet servant gathered\nup the tangled hair.\n\n\"Her ladyship would like you to come to her room before you leave for\nthe opera,\" she said, as she drew the brush across the soft brown locks.\n\nDiana did not reply.\n\nYes, she was admitting to herself she had been unreasonable, as her\nfather said.  Life was beautiful and wonderful, and she meant to gather\nall its sweetness and bloom.\n\n\n\n\n                             *CHAPTER III*\n\n\nThe rain that battered down the glory of color into the soaked earth of\nthe park had slashed and beaten black, struggling lines against the gray\nstone-wall of the buildings in Lincoln\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Inn.  The radiance of the sun\nnever wholly penetrated the court, but to-day the old place seemed like\na tomb.  In one of the forbidding-looking dwellings, in his solicitor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nchambers, sat Lord Kerhill.  He glanced around the silent room, and\naimlessly took in the array of large tin boxes, with their painted\nfamily names, piled high on the shelves encircling the walls.\nConspicuous among them was his own.  With the exception of a few\nunattractive pieces of solid mahogany and some large leather chairs, the\nroom was almost empty.  Its ugliness jarred him.  As he sat there, his\nface in repose showed that the years had given an added touch of\nbitterness to his expression.  He still retained his well-cut features,\nand their beauty of line was only a little marred by a certain heaviness\nthat had recently developed.  His dark mustache hid the weak mouth with\nits suggestion of sensuality; indeed, the whole man showed a strong\ntendency towards grossness as yet only noticeable to the careful\nobserver.\n\nHe still had the ineffable quality of charm, when he willed to exert it,\nwhich made his selfishness seem to many only the outcome of impulsive\nyouthfulness. In a shamefaced way he admitted to himself now that he was\nin the wrong and that he had stupidly involved his affairs, but he\ncomforted himself in the same moment, with the fatuousness of\nself-indulgence, that everything would work out all right.  To tide over\nthis difficulty or adjust and evade for a time the demand of the hour\nhad been his policy for so long that he could not realize that an end\nwas possible to the long tether he so often abused.\n\nHe had come in response to an urgent summons. Opposite him, deeply\nabsorbed in some papers, sat Johnston Petrie, the trusted solicitor of\nthe Kerhill family since Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father came into the title.  He was a\nlarge, powerfully built man of fifty-five, with a massive head, piercing\nblack eyes under shaggy eyebrows, and close-cropped iron-gray curls\nabove the shrewd face.  Henry rose impatiently to go.\n\nAs he did so, Petrie lifted his glasses on their black ribbon to his\neyes, and said, \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m exceedingly sorry, your Lordship, but you must give\nme time to look more closely into that affair before I can venture a\nfinal opinion as to the condition of the estate. Besides, I have several\nother matters of the gravest importance to question you about; they\npertain to some business transactions you made recently without my\nknowledge, while you were abroad.\"\n\nHe motioned his lordship to a chair as though to pursue deeper the\nconversation, and drew several documents from a drawer.  Henry Kerhill\nfidgeted.\n\n\"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impossible, Petrie.  Next week, after the wedding, or after we\nreturn from Scotland, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have leisure then to discuss these things\nwith you, and I really mean this time to have you adjust everything and\nset me quite straight.\"\n\nJohnston Petrie shook his head.\n\n\"Oh, I know,\" Henry continued, \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been careless, but I mean to pull\nup.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start fair from next week.\"\n\nJohnston Petrie looked up sharply.  He knew more of his client\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career\nthan Henry cared to remember.  He had known him from boyhood, and his\nshrewd summing up of human nature could see only pitfalls ahead for Lady\nElizabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son.  He had tried in every way to stop the reckless living\nof his client.  From the incessant demands made on the estate for large\nsums of ready money he knew that Henry Wynnegate, irritated by the\nconservative principles of his firm, had used outside help to prevent\nhis family adviser from obtaining knowledge of some recent speculations.\n\nLong ago Johnston Petrie would have asked to be released from the\nresponsibilities of the Kerhill affairs, out for a loyal devotion to his\ndead client, the late Earl, and a desire to protect Lady Elizabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfast diminishing rights.  He was not in the least deceived by Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmachinations, but wilfully allowed himself to seem blind to certain\nmatters.  He wished to be able to keep his hand at the lever, and argued\nwith his brother that the end justified the means.\n\nLady Elizabeth in a recent interview had assured him that the coming\nmarriage would be the turning-point in Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career.  Nevertheless, he\nfeared her judgment.  Something in Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attitude to-day had made him\nmore apprehensive; it had been impossible to pin him down to a serious\nconsideration of his affairs.  Petrie determined to venture a final\neffort, by enrolling his brother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s services to strengthen his\nadmonitions.\n\n\"Lord Kerhill,\" he said.  \"My brother is also most anxious to see you\nregarding some stocks you asked his advice about.\"  He touched a bell; a\nclerk answered from an adjoining room.\n\n\"Ask Mr. Malcolm Petrie to come to us.  Say that the Earl of Kerhill is\nhere.\"\n\nHenry chafed under the calm firmness of his solicitor.  He had come in\nanswer to an imperative note, and the discussion of his complicated\naffairs was extremely disagreeable.  He was in no mood to continue it\nfurther.  He moved to the door as Malcolm Petrie entered; a smaller\ncounterpart of his brother, and a silent member of the firm, he took the\nsame personal interest in the Kerhill affairs that his brother did.  As\nhe started to speak he was stopped by Henry.\n\n\"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no use.  I can wait no longer.  A most important engagement\ndemands my leaving at once. Advise me by letter\u00e2\u0080\u0094it will reach me\nto-morrow.\" And before either of the men could urge upon him the\nnecessity of being allowed to advise him on certain negotiations, he had\nreached the outer door of the chambers, mounted the few steps leading to\nthe court, and was in the square where his cab was waiting.  He cursed\nthe dreariness of the day as the rain splashed him.  For a moment he\nhesitated.  They had detained him far too long, these croaking fogies in\ntheir stuffy office.  His hand fumbled in his pocket where lay a letter\nwith a message not to be disregarded. On its arrival at his club early\nin the afternoon the note to Diana had been despatched.\n\nThe fury of haste that had made him so eager to escape from his business\ninterview now deserted him. The rain drenched him in warm torrents.  The\ndriver on the box was a running stream, and from the horse came clouds\nof heavy steam.\n\nThen the momentary irresolution passed as he gave his orders to the\nimpassive cabman.  He leaned back in his cab, tearing into shreds the\nmauve letter with its gold monogram as he muttered, \"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for the last\ntime, by God.\"  The hansom started with a jerk.  It rattled down an\nalley.  To Henry the damp, dismal court looked more than ever like a\ngraveyard.  He was glad when they turned into the vortex of the Strand.\n\n\nThat night at the opera, a new singer was to make her d\u00c3\u00a9but in \"Carmen.\"\nIn Paris and America this sloe-eyed Italian had made the sensation of\nthe half-century in her creation of the gypsy wanton.  The brilliant\nthrong in Covent Garden was alive with anticipation.  The royalties were\nexpected; indeed, the queen herself had especially commanded this\nreception for the gifted woman whom she had honored as her guest on the\nRiviera, where this singing Rachel had entranced her with the folk-songs\nand lullabies of her beloved country.\n\nAll that the London season could assemble of wit, beauty, and\ndistinction was gathered in the Opera-House.  The tiers of boxes were\nfilling unusually early.  Near the stage sat the Prime-Minister, a man\nof strong artistic perceptions and a writer of extraordinary talent.\nHis face, with the marked cleft in the square chin, looked less dreamy\nthan usual to-night, and the large, pale-blue eyes, amusedly surveyed\nthe house.  He seemed to have slipped off the yoke of tangled politics\nas he turned to his secretary, who was pointing out to him the\ncelebrities in the stalls.\n\n\"There is the delightful American whom I met last week at Lord\nBlight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\"  As he spoke, he bowed to the new American favorite, Mrs.\nHobart Chichester Chichester Jones, a radiant figure in scarlet, who\nfound many glasses levelled at her.\n\n\"Only an American would dress so originally,\" the minister replied.\n\nThe American wore a gown of clinging scarlet fabric, the decidedly\nlow-cut corsage showing the perfection of the white shoulders and arms.\nAround her throat she had twisted one long rope of uncut pearls and\ndiamonds that reached below her waist, and in the soft, waving, red-gold\nhair she had arranged some daring scarlet geraniums.  With her pale skin\nand great green eyes she enchanted London by her unusual type.  Near her\nwas the famous story-book Duchess, as the most popular of the younger\nbeauties was called.  \"Too good to be true,\" _Truth_ declared her, and\nindeed she seemed to have been especially created to confirm the mode of\nthe old-fashioned romances extolling the grace and loveliness of an\nEnglish Duchess.  The crowd noticed the famous rubies that shone like\ntiny flames against the white gown.\n\nHere and there a Dowager gleamed like a shelf in a Bond Street\njeweller\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shop, so promiscuous was her array of gems.  The younger\nschool of beauties with more wisdom employed their jewels differently,\nusing them as an added tone of color or a touch of brilliance to a\ncostume.  In the stalls the art world was well represented.  Painters\nand writers with a sprinkling of actors and actresses, who were not\nplaying, were on hand to-night to greet the new-comer.  From the gallery\nrail a crowd of eager, swarthy faces peered, impatiently gesticulating\nto one another, because of the failure of the curtain to ascend at the\ngiven time. It was known that the prima-donna was a capricious creature,\noften swayed by a mere whim from making her appearance.  Once the death\nof a mocking-bird had postponed her d\u00c3\u00a9but as Marguerite.  Would she\nreally appear?\n\nAs the royalties entered the box, the excitement was at fever-heat.\nHenry with his mother impatiently awaited Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrival.\n\nThe overture began its sensuous, stirring appeal, and before the\ncigarette-girl crossed the bridge in the street scene, every seat and\nbox was occupied.\n\nThe singer made the ill-starred Carmen a bewitching and compelling\nwanton.  Who that saw her will ever forget her delicious cajolery as she\nurged the bewitched Don Jos\u00c3\u00a9 to loosen the ropes that bound her?  With\nher Habanera she eclipsed all predecessors and made the role irrevocably\nhers.  The first act ended with a storm of bravas from the gallery and\nvociferous applause from the rest of the house.\n\nIt was not until the tumultuous ovation over the first act had ceased\nthat Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence was noticed by the audience.  Accompanied by her\nfather, she had arrived at the close of the overture, and had only time\nto slip into her place before the curtain arose. The walk in the rain\nhad given her delicate skin a touch of color and heightened the beauty\nof her tender eyes, \"so deeply blue that they were black,\" as Lord\nPatrick Illington described them on his first meeting at her\npresentation at Court.  Her bands of straight hair were wound around her\nhead; pale-green draperies encircled her lithesome body, and the\ngardenia blossoms in her hair gave her a fleeting likeness to the\nwater-sprite Undine.  In the horseshoe of fashionable _mondaines_ the\nfragrance of her beauty was like that of a dew-sprayed rose.\n\nMrs. Hobart Chichester Chichester Jones, with her usual common-sense of\nseeing things as they were, leaned towards the man beside her.\n\n\"That is a beauty\u00e2\u0080\u0094the real thing; no chic, no gowning, no Paris wisdom\nof make-up, but a beauty. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve seen it.\"  She sank back as\nthough philosophically preparing for a Waterloo.\n\nFrom his box the Prince noticed the daughter of Sir Charles Marjoribanks\nwhose services in diplomacy in his youth were not forgotten.  Forthwith\nan equerry was sent to Sir Charles and Diana inviting them to visit the\nroyal presence.\n\nDiana was the social novelty of the season.  The Prime-Minister\nremembered his classics as he dreamily gazed at her and murmured, \"Is\nthis the face that launched a thousand ships?\"\n\nFrom the back of the box, Henry watched Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impression on the house.\nHis eyebrows were drawn into horns of suppressed temper and there was an\nair of brutal determination in his bearing.  Gradually his expression\ncleared.  Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beauty that night stirred the best in him.  He tried\nto dismiss the events of the afternoon; he would be worthy of this\nchild-woman.  He set his shoulders square as though preparing to fight\nunseen forces.\n\n\"Lucky fellow, Kerhill,\" one man confided to another as they watched the\ncrowd\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sweeping glasses pause constantly at Diana Marjoribanks\u00e2\u0080\u0099s box\nand saw the triumphant look on Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.\n\nThe sinuous, commanding Carmen had reached her triumphant entry with the\ntoreador when the mad Don Jos\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dagger drew the purple stain on the\ngold-embroidered gown.  Over the house a spell-bound silence reigned.\nAs from an animal wounded to the death, low sounds of agonized pain came\nfrom the great actress\u00e2\u0080\u0094she forgot to sing, and the house forgot that she\nwas a singer in an opera comique. For the moment it faced the realistic\ntruth of a grim tragedy.\n\nExcited and intoxicated by the sensuous music, Diana was hardly\nconscious that the opera was over. She was like a child with the world\nfor a great, colored balloon.  As she came down the winding staircase\nshe was almost happy, and turned to smile at Henry, who was by her side.\nAs she did so she saw him frown. They reached the foot of the staircase,\nand found their way half-barred by a dark, foreign-looking woman robed\nin a spun-gold gown.  Diana noticed the insolent, amused expression on\nher handsome face, but at that moment her attention was diverted by some\none who spoke to her, and she only vaguely noticed Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constrained\nbow, and the sudden brutal flame in his eyes.\n\nOnly later, as she sleepily looked over at the park in the dim light,\ndid she remember that the woman in cloth of gold at the bottom of the\nstaircase was strangely like the vivid, foreign-looking woman who had\nflashed past her in the park as the storm broke.\n\nThe wedding took place at St. George\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, Hanover Square.  It was the\nfirst brilliant wedding of the season and royalty honored it, not by\nsending a deputy, but by its personal presence.  Diana passed through\nthe gay pageant and heard the conventional words of well-wishers like\none in a dream.  She remembered being changed into a going-away\nfrock\u00e2\u0080\u0094the curious street crowd gathering around her as she left the\nreception at the Park Lane house.  Then as she entered the brougham she\nwas conscious of Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face drawn close to hers, and the old\nfrightened instincts that her father only a week ago had soothed and\nquelled again took possession of her. A great wall of fear closed in\nabout her.\n\nAt last the carriage reached the station.\n\nDiana leaned back in their compartment in the train northbound for\nScotland.  The bustle of the outgoing crowds was holding Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nattention as she glanced over the afternoon paper, which gave a\nprominent position to the brilliant wedding that had taken place at St.\nGeorge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only a few hours ago.\n\nSuddenly she espied a name that made her heart leap.  A brief paragraph\ntold of the reward to be conferred on Captain James Wynnegate, but a\nlonger account followed, giving details of his gallant work in the\nNorthwestern Hills.\n\nA great longing to see the friend of her childhood came over her.  She\nwas ashamed that she had forgotten him so long.\n\nHenry entered the compartment, the guard closed the door, and the train\nstarted on its journey.  Her husband spoke to her and she answered him\nin an absent manner.  The sudden remembrance of her old playmate grew\nvividly and seemed to blot out all else, as, following on her\nself-reproach for forgetting him, came the thought, growing more\npoignant; \"Did Jim remember her?\"\n\n\n\n\n                              *CHAPTER IV*\n\n\nJim lay in the hospital ward convalescing.  Of the march back to the\nnearest hospital post, after the fight which has taken place three\nmonths before in the Northwestern Hills, when his name had been flashed\nover Europe in praise of his magnificent service to his flag, his mind\nheld no memory.\n\nNight after night in his delirium he lived again through the scenes of\nthe fight that had brought glory to his name.  Now it was the evening\nbefore the battle, when, acting upon information brought by the spy\nRham-shi, he and his men kept their long vigil, sitting silently in\ntheir saddles the entire night awaiting the onslaught of the fanatical\nnatives across the hill. Again it was early dawn, and in his\nfever-tossed dreams he heard the roar of the voices as the assault\nbegan; again he climbed to the summit of the hill and saw the dreaded\ngun of the enemy that was riddling his men. On\u00e2\u0080\u0094on he mounted.  He felt\nthe warm blood ooze down his body, the mists swim before his eyes, and\nthe stinging pain pierce his side.  In despair that he might not reach\nthe monster in time to prevent it from completing its deadly work, his\ncry of agony often rang out in the silent room.\n\n\"Oh, God, God, my men\u00e2\u0080\u0094my splendid men\u00e2\u0080\u0094give me courage!\"\n\nThen his thoughts would wander to the hours when he lay on the ground\nwith the blood dripping from his wound, and with the loaded carbine\nsnatched from a fallen trooper he brought down a tribesman at the\nenemy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gun.  As he fell, another sprang forward\u00e2\u0080\u0094there was another shot\nand still another as the tribesmen went down before his sure aim.  There\nwas but one thought in his brain\u00e2\u0080\u0094to prevent the firing of the gun, the\ndevastation of his men.  Difficult and more difficult it grew to lift\nthe weakening arm.  He could feel as he tossed on his couch the gurgle\nof the blood that glued him to the ground.  He made an effort to rise to\nhis knees.  Another devil was about to load the gun.  He must catch this\none again\u00e2\u0080\u0094he must. It was his last cartridge.  He stretched out his\nstiffening arm feebly; he tried to pull the trigger, but his strength\nfailed him.  Then\u00e2\u0080\u0094one supreme effort, and a report flashed through the\nair.  The rest was a blank, but he had carried the day.\n\nThese delirious hours passed and there followed a vague mid-air\nsuspension of existence.  Of tangible things he was no part.  The years\nof fighting were forgotten.  He was back in the Fairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Corner with\nDiana, he saw the giant trees bending and whispering in the starlight.\nThe smell of the damp earth from the sun-hidden enclosure filled the\nsick-room, and the vibrant, strong, compelling cry of the night-jar\nechoed in his dreams.  Again, he and Diana listened for the flutter of\nthe fairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 wings in the tree-tops. Gradually, even these mists cleared\nfrom his brain, and to-day he waited with impatience the surgeon, who\nwas to decide whether he might obtain his leave.\n\nThe doctor found him sitting up in bed, his lean hands idly resting on\nthe coverlet.\n\n\"Well, doctor,\" he asked, \"what is the verdict? Am I to be allowed to\njoin my regiment?\"\n\nThe surgeon looked into the brave eyes.  Jim was a wraith of the man who\nhad gone into battle.  The drawn cheek-bones were like high lights in\nthe sunken face, the gauntness of the body could be discerned under the\nbedclothes, but the unflinching eyes held the same expression of\neverlasting courage.  The doctor took Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s long, meagre hand.\n\n\"We are done with you, Wynnegate.  You fought a bigger battle here on\nthis cot than you did yon day on the Hills, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve won.\"\n\nJim only smiled.\n\n\"Your regiment is ordered home within a month, and you must go to your\nstation to join it.  Fighting will be a little out of your line for a\nwhile.  I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll find you need England\u00e2\u0080\u0094a summer of sunshine in the\nopen fields.  Then come back later to us again.\"  A suspicious moisture\nclouded his glasses.  He was a man many years older than Jim, and he had\nseen his own boy go down at the head of his troops.  Still, with the\ninstinctive loyalty of the Englishman to his country, he concluded, \"We\nneed such men as you, my son.\"\n\nThe surgeon moved away.  Jim closed his eyes. Presently he looked up.\n\nHe saw the long line of wounded men with here and there a wasted,\npropped-up figure\u00e2\u0080\u0094the quiet nurses passing and repassing.  He began to\nfeel the pulsating call of life again.  For him the sick-room existence\nwas ended; soon he would be back in the Fairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Corner; he could hear\nthe flutter of their wings.\n\n\nThe men were in the mess.  Dunlap and Singleton were stretched out in\nlong, wicker-basket chairs. Tomlinson was talking in an excited voice\nwith several officers of the Tenth Hussars.  \"It means that Jim will\nreceive a mention and a damn fine one,\" Tomlinson was saying, as he\nleaned back in his chair and gulped down his gin-and-seltzer.  Singleton\ncalled to the orderly to bring a whiskey-and-soda.  Dunlap leaned\nforward to Tomlinson as he asked:\n\n\"Is that absolutely sure?  We all know that Jim has done fine work in\nhis seven years here, but are the powers above really going to commend\nhis last bit of pluck?\"\n\n\"The powers above,\" thundered Tomlinson, who loathed being doubted, \"not\nonly mean to commend him, but they mean to decorate him with the bronze\ncross itself.  I had it from Watkins.\"\n\nA long whistle greeted this bit of news.  Watkins was not apt to talk\nwithout positive information.\n\nTomlinson was fairly bursting with enthusiasm and importance.  For him\nstation life in India meant gossip\u00e2\u0080\u0094good or bad news\u00e2\u0080\u0094so long as it was\nnews. He could work himself into a fever of enthusiasm, get all the\nglory out of another man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s receiving a decoration, and rejoice as though\nit had been given to himself. He only asked that it should occur in his\nstation. \"Tommy,\" as he was called, had been known to incite\nblackballing from his club against a man whom he had never seen, because\nno opposition was made. It meant news, and the passing of the word from\none mess to another.  When the man was blackballed, Tomlinson, in a high\nfever of indignation, sought the downed man and became so incensed with\nsympathy that he threatened to resign from a club that could offer such\nindignities: by that time he had forgotten that he had caused it.  At\nthe moment he was basking in the glory of Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s coming honors.  He took\nanother gin-and-seltzer.\n\n\"By George! he was down and done for when he came here from the\nhospital,\" Dunlap said.  \"Never saw such a goner.  But he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s picked up\ntremendously during the past month.\"\n\nSingleton took his whiskey-and-potash from the orderly.\n\n\"Strange,\" he continued, as he sat up, glass in hand. \"Wynnegate is so\neager to go back: never saw anything like it.  Seems as though this\nillness had knocked soldiering out of him, and he was such a keen one\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Mighty fortunate the regiment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time was up and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re ordered home.\nTalk about Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s being glad\u00e2\u0080\u0094Gad! it means something to see those kiddies\nof mine. Wonder if the little beggars will remember me,\" Dunlap mused.\n\nAfter three gins-and-seltzers, it was time for Tomlinson to listen to\nDunlap about his children. He had heard it all before.  He had come from\nhis own mess with the news about Jim.  That was all that interested him,\nso he got up to go.\n\n\"Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll play polo this evening?\" he asked.\n\nSingleton promised he would.\n\n\"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll walk back with you,\" Tomlinson said.\n\nThey started to leave, but catching sight of an orderly with a mail-bag,\nSingleton let Tomlinson go on alone.\n\n\"See you at six for polo, Tommy; and I say, send any of our fellows in\nthat you see.  Tell them the post is in,\" he called as he saw Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nlong, loose-jointed stride across the road.\n\nA blazing sun beat down on Jim as he crossed to the mess.  The April\nweather was anticipating India\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most wearing heat.  But only vaguely he\nnoted the ominous lead-colored sky, with its promise of dust storms.\nThe green of England filled his vision. Since the days in the hospital,\nhis thoughts had recurred incessantly to Diana.  A picture in an\nillustrated paper, picked up in his ward, showed him Miss Diana\nMarjoribanks as a beautiful young girl\u00e2\u0080\u0094little Diana no longer.  There\nwas the same Madonna face, but more exquisitely fair than the child he\nhad left had promised to be.  He hardly cared to admit to himself how\nmuch the picture had stirred him.\n\nWhen he entered the mess he found the men in groups, absorbed in their\nletters.  Singleton and Dunlap both called to him.\n\n\"There are two for you, Jim.\"\n\nLetters did not often come his way.  When he first left England, several\nchild\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letters had come from Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0094these he had answered.  He never\nheard from Henry, and his aunt wrote seldom.\n\n\"Dinningfold.\"  He saw the familiar old postmark. It was from Lady\nElizabeth, then.  Boyishly, he fingered its ample thickness.  It was\ngood of her to write such a budget, he thought, as he tore it open. The\nchatter of voices about him fell unheeding on his ears as the men read\ntheir letters.\n\n\"God!  Breese is dead\u00e2\u0080\u0094dropped down quite suddenly at the club,\"\nSingleton remarked as he turned a page of the letter he was reading.\n\nHis words were almost drowned by an eager, exulting cry.  Half the\nfellows turned toward Dick Farninsby.  He was usually so quiet.\nTo-night his young, fair face was the color of a puppy.\n\n\"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come into the money,\" he stammered.\n\nEvery one knew that Farninsby\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncle had been an old reprobate and that\nDick had had a close pinch on his meagre allowance.  They also knew that\na pretty girl was waiting for him at home.  A buzz of congratulations\nfollowed.  But Tim took no part in them.  He was reading his aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nletter.\n\n\"... We are so sorry that you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be home in time for the wedding.\nDiana and Henry are to be married. It will be a London wedding.  Diana\nhas grown into a beautiful girl and will make a worthy wife for Henry\nand a charming mistress of Maudsley Towers....\"\n\nAs he read, the page became a dancing mass of hieroglyphics.  The men\nwere beginning to light their cigarettes and pipes as they called bits\nof news to one another from the English papers.  He tried hard to make\nthe strange letters shape themselves and form words.  He reread them.\n\"Diana and Henry are to be married.\"  He turned the page.  \"On the 30th\nof April,\" it said.  To-day was the 2d of May.\n\nSeveral of the men started for the polo-fields.  Some one called,\n\"What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your news, Wynnegate?\"  He forgot to answer.  He crushed the\nletter in his hand and left the mess.  Mechanically he put the unopened\nletter from headquarters, with the news of his brilliant reward, in his\npocket.  Across the polo-fields he could see the heavy atmosphere\ngathering in great clouds.  A dust-storm was nursing its imminent wrath.\n\nIt all seemed far away from the Fairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Corner.\n\n\n\n\n                              *CHAPTER V*\n\n\nSince the day in his mess when Jim read the news of Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approaching\nmarriage to Henry, he had been immersed in a strange dreariness of\nfeeling and a curious indifference to the homeward-bound journey.  Night\nafter night he stood alone on the forward-deck of the _Crocodile_ bound\nfrom Bombay for England, and heard the soldiers singing their\ncamp-songs, their strong, rough voices growing tender as they sang their\ncockney ballads of home. But they roused no responsive echo in Jim;\nwatching the Southern Cross in the sky, his thoughts often drifted back\nto the seven years of fighting with their sun-scorched days of fatigue\nand danger, full of work that drained body and brain.  He almost wished\nthat he were returning to them.\n\nOne night at Ismailia the pendulum of his emotions swung back from this\nindifference to the first hours of joy that he had experienced when he\nreceived the news that his regiment was ordered back.  The ship had\nanchored there for a few hours to obtain supplies. With Dunlap and\nSingleton he went ashore to the little hotel with its Continental\natmosphere of cheap table-d\u00e2\u0080\u0099h\u00c3\u00b4te dinners and slipshod Italian waiters.\nIt was a shaky wooden building, built around an inside court, with\nbalconies over which clambered in exuberance pale, waxy tea-roses, while\nthe front of the building hung over a cypress-tree garden.\n\nThe indifferently good but pretentious meal was served in the tiny\ncourt.  Dunlap\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Singleton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boisterous mood jarred Jim.  He found\nhimself watching the other guests of Monsieur Carlos\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hostelry.  At\nadjacent tables parties of tourists were making merry while waiting for\nthe P.&O. steamer to carry them from Cleopatra\u00e2\u0080\u0099s land to golden Italy,\nand from a dance-hall came the fantastic music of the nautch women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ninstruments.  In half an hour the hotel was empty of all the diners save\nJim, who lingered until the shabby proprietor, Monsieur Carlos, informed\nMonsieur le Capitaine that after ten the court was closed, but the\nverandas were at Monsieur\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disposal for his kummel and cigarettes.  Jim\nascended the creaking staircase to the broad veranda partly hidden from\nthe road by its screen of blooming roses gleaming like stars against the\nshadowed foliage. Here and there a tight, pink-tipped bud shone like a\ntiny flame.\n\nThe moon had risen and illumined the entire place with an uncanny\nbrilliance, turning the night into an unreal day.  Jim sank into a\nchair.  The air was heavy with the perfume of the rose-trees.  In the\ndistance he could hear the barbarous clash of the dancing women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncymbals.  It was their trade-night with two ships in the harbor.  Jim\ntook from his pocket a leather portmonnaie and drew from it the picture\nof Diana that he had cut from the paper in the hospital.\n\nHe had never willingly thought of her since the day he received his\naunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter.  As he sat on the deserted veranda, with the torn page\nlying on his knee, he was conscious of a sudden, intangible feeling of\napprehension.  Diana was the tenderest memory of his boyhood.  Why did\nhe fear this marriage with Henry?  Vainly he studied the picture, trying\nto gain from the cheap illustration some knowledge of the woman into\nwhich Diana had grown.  He tried honestly to face the truth of his great\nanxiety concerning the marriage.  He knew that through his convalescence\nwhen the longing to go home had overmastered the soldier in him, the\nthought of renewing his friendship with Diana had been his happiest\nanticipation.  He sought to reassure himself that his disappointment was\nselfishness\u00e2\u0080\u0094that he feared to find Diana absorbed in new interests, with\nhis place completely crowded out of her life.  Then a vision of Henry,\nsullen and defiant as he had last seen him, flashed before him....  Yet\nmight not Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character have been redeemed by his love for Diana?\nJim knew that the meagre fortune of Sir Charles Marjoribanks could not\nbe a material factor in the marriage. This proved his most reassuring\nthought.  Then his memory reverted to Diana, and he recalled the child\nDi, who had clung to him on the morning of his departure and begged him\nto return.  He remembered how as a boy he had often played that he was\nher knight, and fought the unseen foes that were supposed to lurk in the\nalleyways of the giant trees.  Was it a prophetic vision of the future?\n\nHe rose from his chair.  Sweeping clouds were rolling over the pale\nmoon.  The desolation of the place grew more terrible.\n\nFar out at sea he could see the black phantom ship now appearing, now\ndisappearing.  It seemed at the mercy of the heavy vapors that at times\ntouched its topmasts.  The desire to reach England again grew strong in\nhim.  He felt he had a purpose to fulfil.\n\nA half-hour passed.  Suddenly the moon swept from under a heavy cloud,\nshaped like the wing of a monster bird.  Across the road he could see\nthe straggling groups of travellers returning from the festivities.\nTheir tired, excited voices reached him, and he was glad to escape from\nthe hotel and make his way to the waiting dinghy.  Dunlap and Singleton\njoined him, and as he leaned back in the skiff, strong and incessant as\nthe incoming tide that beat against the boat grew the strength of his\nresolve. Diana should obtain happiness if he could serve her to that\nend.\n\nThree weeks later the _Crocodile_ swung into the harbor at Portsmouth.\nA symphony in blues and greens greeted Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes as they anchored\nwithin sight of the Victory.  An English June sky with riotous\nblues\u00e2\u0080\u0094from the palest flaky azure to the deepest turquoise\u00e2\u0080\u0094hung in the\nheavens over a vivid green sea.  The very atmosphere seemed floating\nabout in nebulous clouds of pearly tinted indigo.  To Jim it was like\nthe beauty of no other land.\n\nTowards evening Jim reached London.  The town was alive with the roar\nand rush of hansoms and crowded \u00e2\u0080\u0099buses carrying the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s workers to\ntheir homes.  His cab turned from St. James\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Park into the Mall towards\nhis club.  How he loved the gray, majestic beauty of the place!\n\nThe expected arrival of the _Crocodile_ had been duly noticed by the\npapers, and his part in the brilliant work of his regiment warmly\ncommended.  At the club he found letters of welcome awaiting him. Among\nthem was one from Diana, urging him to come to them at once.  It seemed\nthe letter of a woman calm in her established womanhood.  \"Henry and I,\"\nit said, \"will be so happy to see you to-morrow at luncheon at two\no\u00e2\u0080\u0099clock.  Do come.\"  The letter further told him that Lady Elizabeth and\nMabel were staying at the Towers.  \"Henry wanted a town-house, so we are\nsettled at Pont Street for the season.\"\n\nLate that night Jim sat alone in his club, and wrote an answer to\nDiana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s letter.  He spoke of his pleasure in being able to go to them on\nthe morrow, but its phrases gave no sign of his intense feeling and his\ngreat desire for her happiness.  He left the club and walked to the\npillar-box opposite.  He slipped the letter into the slit of the box,\nand slowly retraced his steps.  A slight haze was beginning to creep\nover the city, and in the distance it looked as though a gauze\ntheatre-drop was shutting off the scene from the spectators.\n\nJim was loath to leave the streets.  There was an enchantment for him in\nthe smoky atmosphere that intoxicated him.  The call of London was in\nhis blood. As he crossed the quiet Square near the Mall, he stretched\nout his arms, and youth and the joy of life rang out in one great\ncry\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh, it was good to be home!\n\n\n\n\n                              *CHAPTER VI*\n\n\nJim slept but little that night.  In the morning his first thought was\nto reach the War Office, which he did almost before that dignified\nmachine was prepared to receive him.  A rumor was afloat that the Tenth\nHussars might have to start shortly for South Africa, but he found that\nthe gossip had been greatly exaggerated.  Even if troops were sent out,\nhe was assured that the Tenth Hussars were immune from active service\nfor a long period.  He rejoiced at the news, for he was tired of foreign\nservice. His long illness had left him shaken and requiring a\nmuch-needed rest for recuperation.\n\nAt the War Office he learned that Henry had resigned his regiment and\nwas at the head of the Surrey Yeomanry, with headquarters near the\nTowers. This argued well, he told himself; it meant work and\nresponsibility for Henry that would engage his interest and surely win\nhim away from his old, reckless way of living.\n\nThe morning slipped away with its many demands on his first day in town.\nHis hansom turned into Sloane Street only as a clock near by struck two.\nIn a few minutes the door of the Pont Street house was opened to him,\nand he was ushered into the library.\n\nHe dropped lightly into an arm-chair near a table heaped with books.\nSuddenly a door opened as though at the end of a corridor.  He\ndistinctly heard voices raised in strong argument behind the hangings;\none sounded like Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; a half-suppressed oath followed.\n\n\"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no use,\" the voice went on.  \"You must do as I say.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\npreach.\"  He could not hear the words that followed.  Jim wished it were\npossible to make known his presence in the room.  He crossed to the\nfarther window to avoid hearing the remainder of the conversation, but\nthe clear and incisive words of the first speaker\u00e2\u0080\u0094this time Jim knew it\nwas Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0094again struck his ears sharply.\n\n\"I must have the money, Petrie; make what explanation you like, but send\nit to me within a week. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s useless arguing.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve lost heavily in\nspeculation.  Here are the papers.\"  The opening and slamming of several\ndrawers followed.  To Jim the words that he had just heard were like a\nknell to his hopes of the past week for Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happiness.  So this was\nthe truth!  Another mortgage!  He knew enough of the involved condition\nof the estate to dread the possibilities of that word.\n\nAs Jim sat in the window-seat facing the street, he was so absorbed in\nhis reflections that he did not hear the door open.  With a start he\nfelt a pair of hands clasped over his eyes.\n\n\"Guess!\" the low voice said.\n\nHe answered, quickly, \"Di!\"\n\n\"Yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Di, Jim; and such a happy Di to see you again.\"\n\nAs he turned he half expected to see the tiny child as he had last seen\nher, with the puppy in her arms calling, \"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Di, Jim.\"  For a moment\nthey stood holding each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands and only the eyes of the two\nspoke.  The thoughts of both involuntarily went back to their last\nmeeting.  They realized that unconsciously they had taken up their\nchildhood manner. Slowly their hands unclasped and Diana was the first\nto speak.\n\n\"Oh, Jim, I should hardly know you.  You are so big, so strong, and\nyet\u00e2\u0080\u0094you look as though you had been very ill; have you?\"\n\nShe studied Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face closely, gaunt and drawn, but with the eyes still\nlike gray pools of suppressed fire.  Jim forgot the troubled thoughts\nthat Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words had aroused.  He only knew that Diana stood before\nhim, young and beautiful.  He threw back his head and laughed; it was\nthe ringing, joyous laugh of a boy.\n\n\"And I almost thought, as I turned, that I could see my little Di,\" he\nsaid.\n\nThe memory of the delicate child faded into the tall, strong figure\nbefore him.  Quickly he noted the complexities of her face; its newly\nacquired look of womanhood seemed curiously incongruous with the rest of\nher personality.  He saw in her eyes a haunting expression of marked\npatience.  The new acquaintance of the grown man and woman had adjusted\nitself.\n\n\"Oh, Jim, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m so proud of you,\" Diana said, gravely. \"You have really\ndone something with your life that is worth while.\"\n\n\"Which means, I suppose, that the rest of us have not,\" a voice said.\n\nJim and Diana turned as Henry spoke.  He was standing in the doorway.\nJim noticed with satisfaction that his eyes rested on Diana in\nunquestionable gratification.  Perhaps, after all, Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s love for\nDiana was real.  He remembered that his aunt, in her letter, had written\nof her great faith in this marriage for Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s happiness\u00e2\u0080\u0094indeed, he\nwell remembered that the letter seemed to insist upon the benefits Henry\nwould derive from the marriage.  He wondered what it had meant for\nDiana.\n\n\"Welcome to the hero,\" Henry chaffingly said, as he crossed to Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nside.\n\nAn underlying nervous excitement, at once apparent to Jim, clung to\nHenry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s manner.  Otherwise his greeting was more than reassuring.\n\n\"Did you finish your business interview?\" Diana questioned.  A shade of\ndispleasure showed on Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face as he answered:\n\n\"Yes, yes, I had more than enough of it.\"\n\n\"We postponed luncheon,\" Diana explained to Jim, \"because Henry found\nhis solicitor wished to see him about some repairs needed on the estate.\nThe request was urgent, Henry said, and I knew you would not mind the\ndelay.\"\n\nFor a moment Jim felt as if Henry must read the thoughts that blazed so\nfiercely in his mind.  So this was Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way of deceiving Diana.  He\ntried to control his face so that it might give no sign of the disgust\nhe felt.  Henry had turned away; Jim could see him nervously twisting\nhis mustache; Diana was smiling tenderly on Henry as though in approval\nof his morning\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benevolent work.  Jim, reading between the lines, saw\nHenry wince at the dishonestly gained approbation; and decided that\nHenry was vulnerable where his desire to gain her respect was concerned.\nThis was so much in his favor, at all events.\n\nAn hour later, as they sat over their coffee, Henry began explaining to\nJim his work with the Yeomanry. If Jim stayed at home he wanted him to\njoin in this splendid service to England.\n\n\"We shall need these men later, mark me.  The situation in Africa is\nthreatening.\"  Then followed a discussion of their plans.\n\nHenry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career as a soldier, Jim remembered, had promised well, but he\nalso remembered certain periods of riotous living that had brought him\nfor a time under the ban of the authorities.\n\nAs Henry elaborated his scheme to perfect the Yeomanry in their county,\nJim acknowledged that there was no question of his undoubted ability to\nbe in command.  He succumbed to the strong personal charm of his cousin.\nSurely Henry would control himself and make a worthy showing of his life\nyet.  In Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart was the silent prayer that it might be so, and that\nperhaps he could help him to attain this result.\n\nDiana, listening, was happy in the apparent new bond between the\ncousins.  She had been so eager for this: that Jim should be with them\nas he had been when he was a boy.  Since her marriage, her life had been\nfull of pleasant days, with only here and there the pin-prick of the\nold, frightened instincts.  It usually occurred when Henry was in one of\nhis black moods. Up to the present he had tried to avoid her on these\noccasions.  She strangely rebelled when she came to realize that it was\nher beauty which gave him his greatest pleasure.  That it was primarily\nher youth and loveliness that delighted him, he made no effort to\nconceal.  At times she admitted to herself that she wished it were not\nso flagrant\u00e2\u0080\u0094this frank, pagan joy of the senses which she invoked in\nhim.  But, she reasoned, if she allowed these thoughts to frighten her,\nshe was catching at shadows.  Of tangible facts there was none; indeed,\nshe found it impossible to explain satisfactorily these doubts and\nregrets.\n\nJim was promising Henry that he would think seriously of the Yeomanry\nwork, when Diana suddenly remembered that Henry and she were due at a\nstudio to see a portrait of hers that was soon to be exhibited. At that\nmoment a note was brought to Henry.  Jim observed the quick contraction\nof Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brows and the sharp biting of his lips as he read it.  Henry\ncrumpled the letter.  \"Jim can take you,\" he brusquely said.  \"This note\nis of importance and requires my immediate attention.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerning\nmy interview of this morning.\"\n\nDiana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face showed her disappointment.\n\n\"But this is the third time that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve broken your appointment with me,\nand you promised Mr. Bond that you would surely give your decision on\nthe picture to-day,\" Diana protested.  \"Besides, it is difficult for me\nto take all the responsibility in the matter, and the picture must be\nsent to-day to the exhibition.  Do meet me there later, Henry.\"\n\nHenry had been fighting the Furies for days; his financial worries were\nnow vital to his honor.  Into his eyes came the brutal flash that Jim\nknew so well, and he hurriedly intervened, \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go with you, Di, with\npleasure, if I can be of the slightest service to you.\"\n\nInstead of helping the situation, Jim found that his quick acquiescence,\nalthough suggested by Henry, had the effect of further irritating him.\nHenry turned from the door, to which he had crossed, with the crumpled\nnote in his hand; all the old, domineering, rebellious temper struck\nflame.\n\n\"There!  You have Jim.  What more can you wish?  Your hero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion\nwill no doubt interest you far more than mine, so don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t talk rot about\nyour disappointment.\"\n\nDiana stood silent, amazed at her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncalled-for fury.  Jim\nfound it impossible to speak. The servant returned to see if the answer\nto the note was ready.\n\nHenry contended for a few seconds with a tempestuous remorse as strong\nas the flare of his nervous outbreak; he bitterly regretted his lack of\ncontrol. He had tried to conceal the strain he had been under all the\nday; to be thwarted as he apparently was by the news from Petrie, was to\narouse the demons of destruction in him\u00e2\u0080\u0094destruction to himself as well\nas to those near him.  He cursed himself as the victim of his own folly;\nbut to see Jim master of the situation roused the old rebellion of his\nboyhood.  A movement from the waiting servant recalled him, and with a\nfew words of half-muttered apology he hurriedly left the room.  A moment\nlater they heard him drive away.\n\nFrom so small a matter so great a consequence had arisen.  This insight\ninto Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nature again showed Jim the quicksands on which Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhappiness was built.\n\nTo Diana the incident was embarrassing, but with infinite tact she made\nno allusion to it.  Jim marvelled at the quiet control with which she\ndeftly turned it aside.\n\nThe carriage was announced.\n\n\"Will you come, Jim?\" Diana asked.\n\nHe hesitated.\n\n\"Do,\" she coaxingly said, \"it would help me.\"\n\nUnder the calm, serious face he could see the tremulous expression that\nshowed her quivering, hurt feelings.  The tender eyes held him fast.\nStill he hesitated.  As in a moment of prevision he was urged to say no;\nit seemed as though he were starting on a way that led him into\ndarkness.  The absurd compelling force fastened around him in a tight\ngrip; he tried to stammer a few words; he was irritated by his apparent\nstupidity, then he heard Diana say: \"Let me decide for you.\"\n\nAs she spoke, a shaft of golden light penetrated the room.  Why should\nhe not go?  He quickly threw off the intangible feeling of fear.  He\ntold her he was only too happy to be of service.  It was a warm, mellow,\nsummer day, and the soft, alluring air quickly lulled Jim into a\ntranquil mood.\n\nAs they stood before the portrait, Jim knew that it was one of the\npainter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s true inspirations.  The simple brown gown in which Diana had\nbeen painted brought out the gold in the bands of her straight hair.  It\nfaded away into a dull background, leaving only her luminous face in\nhigh relief.  The painted oval contour and the curved lips were there in\nall their beauty; but the shadowy eyes unconsciously showed the troubled\nsoul.  It was a portrait of Diana older in years and experience.  The\npainter seemed to have passed by her obvious youth and divined her in\nher maturity.  Curiously enough, the portrait stirred Jim more than his\nmeeting with Diana had done.\n\nWhen they descended to the carriage, Diana said, \"Come and drive\u00e2\u0080\u0094not in\nthe park, but let us go along the Embankment, across the bridge towards\nRichmond.  I long for a breath of the country.\"  This time he made no\neffort to resist her appeal.\n\nAs they drove, Jim learned from Diana the news about Sir Charles.  His\nill health had greatly increased, and a London specialist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion had\nbeen far from sanguine.  He gathered that Diana felt it was the\nbeginning of the end; as she spoke, Jim could read the anguish of her\nthoughts.  Once she turned to him and said:\n\n\"I have so few to love.\"\n\nSoon they found themselves talking merrily over gay reminiscences of\ntheir childhood days.  The hours slipped by, and it was only the\ndeepening of the shadows that reminded Diana that she was entertaining\nthe Prime-Minister that night at a large dinner-party. The return home\nwas quickly made.\n\n\"Won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you dine with us, Jim?\" Diana asked, as they reached Pont Street.\n\"We can easily lay an extra cover.\"\n\nBut Jim, feeling that it would be better not to see Henry that night,\npleaded an engagement at his club. He left Diana with a promise to see\nher soon.\n\nThat night he forgot her unusual beauty; he remembered only the\nfragrance of her personality. During the following week he obtained a\nleave of absence, and with Singleton planned to go abroad. Why he did\nthis he could not quite explain.  He saw Diana and Henry only once\nbefore leaving for his holiday.  That was in June.\n\n\n\n\n                             *CHAPTER VII*\n\n\nUpon the expiration of his sick leave, Jim returned to his regiment,\nstationed at Dorden, a few miles from Dinningfold.  He found the\nsituation but little changed at the Towers.  Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s uncertain moods\nmade Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visits a doubtful pleasure, but since his first day at Pont\nStreet there had been no decided outbreak on his cousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part.\n\nThe autumn brought with it the calamitous war in South Africa, and all\nthoughts were concentrated on preparing the Yeomanry of the country to\nbe ready to join the Regulars in the field.  Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s services were readily\nenlisted by Henry, and in the organization of the county\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Yeomanry he\nbecame an active force. His work often required him to spend days at the\nTowers.\n\nWith the passing of the last days of the old year, Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moodiness\nincreased; even Lady Elizabeth seemed hopeless and unable to avert them,\nand Jim could see the bitter disillusionment that Diana daily\nencountered.  During the winter Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attitude towards Diana changed;\nher presence was an irritation to him.  At times he made every effort to\nregain his lost footing, but again and again he forfeited the newly\nacquired grace which her clemency granted.  Days of absence from the\nTowers were now not uncommon. The light gradually faded from Lady\nElizabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, leaving it a haunting gray mask.  But no word was\nspoken by either of the women to Jim.  Both were indefatigable in their\nefforts to relieve the condition of the soldiers freezing on the African\nveldt.  A fund was started in the county to be used for the widows and\norphans of the fighting men, and Henry was placed at the head of it.\n\nIn London the innumerable bazaars and f\u00c3\u00aates given to swell the various\nfunds of relief were the principal functions of the fashionable world.\nJim, who had just returned from a visit to Scotland over the holiday\nseason, was standing near a stall in Albert Hall, presided over by Mrs.\nHobart Chichester Chichester Jones.  As she eagerly turned towards him\nthere was no doubt of the American woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desire to gain his\napprobation.  A friendship had sprung up between them since Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return\nfrom India, and her frankness amused him.  It was Sadie Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second\nyear in London, and the half of the great houses that had been denied\nher the previous year were now open to her and she was a much sought\npersonage at their festivities.\n\nWhether this was due to her insouciant face with its tip-tilted nose, or\nthe slight lisp that made her American accent seem so fetching, her\nfriends could not decide.  Her enemies\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Sadie Jones had them at\nBattle Creek\u00e2\u0080\u0094declared it was her charming characteristic of never\nremembering a social slight; of generously forgiving the offender and in\ntrue Christian spirit offering the other cheek.  They forgot what Jim\nand her sponsors in London could plainly see\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was her frankness that\nrazed to the ground her social barrier.  When she spoke quite frankly of\na boarding-house her mother had kept in a mining-town where Hobart Jones\nhad been a paying guest, and told in picturesque exaggeration of her\nstarved youth and pitiful hatred of her environment\u00e2\u0080\u0094of the longing to\nescape to the great life of Europe with its men and women of\ntradition\u00e2\u0080\u0094she disarmed the gossips.  She frankly acknowledged what was\nher detractors\u00e2\u0080\u0099 store of tittle-tattle.  It was a unique game and it\nwon.\n\nJim watched her with tolerant interest as she inveigled a young\nguardsman into giving a substantial donation to the cause.  As he idly\nsurveyed the scene he wondered at Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to attend the f\u00c3\u00aate.\nThe tired women who had been in attendance were disposing of the remains\nof their stock.  The eager crowd that had thronged the hall and paid a\nhalf-crown to be served tea by a duchess, or to see a peeress act as\nbarmaid in rivalry to a popular Rosalind of the stage, was gradually\nthinning out.\n\nJim started to leave the flag-bedecked hall with its litter of packages\nand debris-strewn floor as proofs of the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s profitable traffic.\nSadie Jones, who had been skilfully effecting her sales and keeping him\nin sight, turned to him.\n\n\"Wait and drive home with me to dinner.  The brougham\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at the door.  I\nhave news for you of Lady Kerhill.  I have just returned from a visit.\"\n\nMrs. Jones lived in a box of a house in Curzon Street. It was a setting\nespecially designed to suit her small, birdlike personality.  But Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nstalwart frame seemed grotesquely out of proportion in the small French\nsalon.  The dinner was an amusing _t\u00c3\u00aate-\u00c3\u00a0-t\u00c3\u00aate_ with Sadie at her most\nvivacious best, telling anecdotes of the plains she loved.\n\n\"Sometimes I long for the smell of the alkali.  It chokes one, but I\nfind the fogs far harder to swallow. I was bred to it.\"\n\nHitherto her descriptions of the prairie had often made Jim long to see\nthe country she painted so vividly.  Suddenly she turned to Jim and with\nquick decision said:\n\n\"I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand your Englishman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s point of view.  Why, in America,\nif Hoby Jones had treated me as Lord Kerhill is treating his wife, there\nwould be ructions.  Yes, ructions,\" she calmly went on, in answer to\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look of amazement.  \"Lord Kerhill is your cousin, I know, but Lady\nKerhill is an angel. Why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you do something?\"\n\nFor a moment Jim could not quite grasp her irrelevant outburst.  Then he\nlearned that Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s failure to appear at the bazaar was due to days of\naccumulated anxiety at the Towers.  Henry had been away for a week\nwithout a word of explanation to those at home.\n\n\"Of course,\" Sadie Jones continued as she leaned back and puffed her\ncigarette, \"I know the truth. We all do here in town.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drinking\ninordinately and leading a most flagrant life.  An earl may be a\nstable-boy, I find, and Kerhill is certainly behaving like one.  Lady\nElizabeth is trying to cover up the situation, and Lady Kerhill seems\ndazed by recent events.\"\n\nOf the sincerity of her interest in Diana, Jim could have no doubt.\nUnder her frivolities she had an appreciation of what was fine in men\nand women. As she talked she was carefully watching the effect of her\nwords on Jim; her instinct had long ago told her that Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interest in\nDiana was no usual one\u00e2\u0080\u0094how unusual she did not care to probe.  She knew\nthat he was the one person who might have an influence over Henry; she\nalso knew that by this conversation she might be stirring up a situation\nthat would far from benefit her, but she played the game fair.  She was\nrich\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jim was almost poor.  Often she wondered and hoped\u00e2\u0080\u0094but so far her\ndreams, she knew, were built alone upon her desires.\n\nThey talked for another hour, and when Jim left the Curzon Street house\nhe promised Sadie Jones he would see Henry.  From her window Sadie\nwatched him swinging down the street.  She had tried to serve Diana,\nbut, she asked, what had she accomplished for herself?  She lighted\nanother cigarette and settled her foot against the fender.  She was\nthinking of Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face as he had listened to her talk about Diana.\n\nThe fire burned gray.  A line of \"dead soldiers,\" as the boys at Battle\nCreek had called the half-burned cigarettes, lay on the hearthstone\u00e2\u0080\u0094a\ntribute to the length of her reverie.  Another expression of the boys at\nhome came back forcibly to her as she left the room and crossed to her\nbedchamber.  After all, she had been \"dead game.\"  Gain or loss, she did\nnot regret her evening\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work.\n\nAs Jim walked along Piccadilly, he knew that Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s _liaisons_ were now\ntown-talk.  It was useless to close his eyes to the suspicions of the\npast month. Sadie Jones represented the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opinion, and what she\ntried to warn him about would soon be brutally brought to Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nknowledge.  At the club he could find no news of Henry.  All night he\nthought out the question of the wisdom of his approaching Henry, but the\nstrength of his determination only grew as the gray of the dawn\nincreased.\n\nThe following morning he called at Pont Street. He found Henry lingering\nover some breakfast.  A brandy-glass and empty soda-bottle aroused Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsuspicions, while the bloated circles under Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, and his\nyellow, discolored skin, were unmistakable proofs of a recent debauch.\nAs Jim entered, Henry looked up with surprise.\n\n\"Didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect you back so soon,\" he said, after their strained\ngreetings.  Henry seemed ill at ease.  \"Anything up?\" he went on, as Jim\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak.\n\nThere was a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s portentous silence.\n\n\"Henry,\" Jim began, very calmly, \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to speak to you about certain\nmatters.\"\n\nHenry, who had been shifting about in his chair, became motionless.  His\nclinched hands strained purple as he grasped the chair rail.\n\n\"About the\u00e2\u0080\u0094Yeomanry\u00e2\u0080\u0094work?\" he half stammered while his eyes furtively\nsought Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.\n\nBut Jim, who was thinking only of Diana and the difficulty of alluding\nto Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recent conduct, failed to notice his faltering words and\nfrightened expression.\n\n\"Oh no\u00e2\u0080\u0094no,\" he answered.  \"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going on all right, I hear.\"  He\nhesitated.  Then with a quick breath he said, \"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no use.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got to\nblurt out what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s troubling me.  All the town is talking about your life;\nits flagrance, its indecencies.  Do you realize that it will soon reach\nDiana, and that Lady Elizabeth is quivering under the strain of a\ncertain amount of knowledge which she is hiding, and is dreading further\ndisclosures?\"\n\nAs Jim spoke he seemed to gain courage.  \"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak.  Let me have my\nsay,\" he quietly commanded as Henry rose and attempted a blustering\nmanner. \"I am the only man close to Lady Elizabeth and Diana.  For Sir\nCharles to become aware of this scandalous condition of affairs would be\ndisastrous. You know that perfectly.  Now tell me, in God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name, why\nyou married Di if you wished to lead this life?\"  He paused.  \"Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you\npull yourself together? It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not too late.  So far nothing definite is\nknown to either Di or Lady Elizabeth, and you may trust me.\"  He rose\nand crossed to Henry.  \"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all true, I suppose\u00e2\u0080\u0094what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m accusing you\nof\u00e2\u0080\u0094isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\"  There was no answer.  He laid his hand on Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nshoulder.  \"Tell me that it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s over and that you mean to go straight.\"\n\nHenry turned.  All his rebellion seemed to have slipped from him.\nSuddenly he dropped into a chair and buried his head in his hands.\n\n\"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not fit\u00e2\u0080\u0094not fit, do you hear?\u00e2\u0080\u0094for Di.  I married her because I\nloved her.  Yes, I did.  But you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what it is to fight daily\nthe devil\u00e2\u0080\u0099s desire. God! what do you know about it?  I am in the meshes.\nI have sunk lower and lower.  You want to know about this woman the\nworld links with my disgrace.  Well, I tried to break with her when I\nmarried Di\u00e2\u0080\u0094I swear I did\u00e2\u0080\u0094but I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  She is like a dog that one has\ngrown attached to\u00e2\u0080\u0094you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fling it out of your life completely. There\nhas always been a wall between Diana and me.  I tried in the beginning\nto reach her, but she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s afraid of me\u00e2\u0080\u0094I know it.\"\n\nAs the torrent of words choked him, he stopped with a quick passion of\nagony.  He was sincere in this confession of his weakness; Jim could not\ndoubt him, though he was astonished at the admission.  He had expected\nHenry to assail him with hard words and insolent denials.  The\nacknowledged truth was sickening.  Henry mechanically took some brandy;\nhe seemed a vibrating bundle of torments.\n\nJim watched him closely.  \"I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to preach, Henry,\" he said, \"but\nwhen you stop that,\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094he pointed to the half-empty flask\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have\nhalf conquered yourself, and the rest will be far easier. This drinking\nwill pull you into days of horror, days that would mean desolation to us\nall.\"\n\nHe hesitated.  Henry crossed to the chimney and leaned against it with\nhis back to Jim.\n\n\"There is every chance for you,\" continued Jim. \"In three months you can\nhave regained your place with Di, and think\u00e2\u0080\u0094think what it would mean to\nyour mother.\"\n\nHenry did not move; his head was resting on his outstretched arms, lying\nacross the mantel edge.  The broken figure of Henry touched Jim deeply.\n\"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right, old man.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll forget this.  Forgive my frankness,\nbut, after all, your interests are mine; your mother and your home were\nmine, and Di\u00e2\u0080\u0094was like a little sister, so I had to speak.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll not say\nanother word.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m off.\"  And almost before Henry could realize it, Jim\nhad left him\u00e2\u0080\u0094left him with the dull burning in his heart and brain.\n\nSo Jim knew.  It had been a relief to acknowledge his pent-up remorse,\nbut he was more deeply involved than his cousin suspected.  Jim knew but\nhalf; the other half, with its awful, dreaded discovery, walked ever\nbeside him.  He made a sudden rush to the door as though to recall Jim,\nto unburden himself and be saved, but the momentary impulse died.  He\nstumbled heavily into a chair; it was useless.  He alone could save the\nsituation, and the half that Jim knew would be bitter enough to face in\nhis daily companionship with him.\n\nAugust came with its heather-clad hills, but England rejoiced less than\nusual in the beauty of the great flower-garden which the entire\ncountry-side resembled. Over it all hung the tragic symbol of war.  The\ncall of Africa for men had been appalling.  In the park of the Towers a\ndetachment of Yeomanry were encamped for a fortnight\u00e2\u0080\u0099s training, and the\nrestful beauty of the place for days had been broken by the firing\nmanoeuvres of the men.  To-night all was quiet, with only the sounds\nfrom the men in their tents faintly reaching the Towers.  Henry was\ngiving a dinner to the officers in command and coffee was being served\nin the garden.  A flaming border of evening primroses were opening their\nyellow, cuplike blossoms, In the distance a boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear voice was\nsinging:\n\n    \"Oh, Tommy, Tommy Atkins, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a good \u00e2\u0080\u0099un, \u00e2\u0080\u0099eart and \u00e2\u0080\u0099and,\n    You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a credit to your country and to all your native land.\"\n\n\nLady Elizabeth had gathered a house-party to see the afternoon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmanoeuvres and to remain for the dinner.  The Bishop leaned back in his\nchair and folded his hands over his apron; his short, lean legs were\nstretched out comfortably\u00e2\u0080\u0094the Kerhills knew how to entertain the Church,\nhe was convinced.  Near him sat Sir John Applegate and Mrs. Chichester\nChichester Jones.  Close to a great bed of white pansies, with scarlet\nstandard roses gleaming like sentinels over the delicate white blossoms,\nwere Mabel, Diana, and Mr. Chiswick, the young ascetic curate.  Henry,\nwho was standing near Lady Elizabeth, kept his eyes moodily on the\nground.  Sir Charles, with a heavy shawl wrapped around him, was\nstretched out in a long basket-chair.  The air was so still that the\nmoving of a bird in its nest or the rustling of a leaf disturbed its\nsilence.\n\n    \"God bless you, Tommy Atkins\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n    Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \u00e2\u0080\u0099ealth to you.\"\n\n\nThe voice ceased.\n\nSir John had been telling a story to Mrs. Jones of the mule who drew a\npension from the American government.\n\n\"Heard that story in America.  Rather good, eh, Mrs. Hobart Chi\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\nignominiously he stood stricken by the American name.  The Bishop,\nseeing his bewilderment turned quickly and whispered the dreadful\ncognomen.  As Sir John finished the broken sentence there was a quiet\nlaugh.\n\nHenry leaned over his mother.  \"Mater,\" he said, \"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think that\nMrs. Hobart Chichester Chichester Jones would make a ripping match for\nJim?  I wish you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d try and make an opportunity to help it along.\"\n\nAs he spoke he already saw the gold from the Battle Creek mines pouring\ninto the coffers of the house of Kerhill.  Lady Elizabeth looked up with\nsudden comprehension.  The American was charming; her look reassured\nHenry.\n\n\"Most assuredly.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do what I can.\"\n\nFrom the drawing-room came the sound of music. An impromptu dance had\nbeen arranged by Diana for the young people, who were beginning to\narrive. At a message from Bates she quietly went towards the open\ncasement to meet her guests.  Henry followed.\n\nAs the others started to follow, Sir John and the Bishop held a\nwhispered consultation.  Then the Bishop, bursting with importance,\nturned to Sir John and said:\n\n\"Shall we take the ladies into our confidence, Sir John?\"\n\n\"By all means, Bishop; yes, do.\"\n\nMabel and Mrs. Jones joined in the supplication.\n\n\"Kerhill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brother officers,\" the Bishop began, \"have purchased a very\nbeautiful loving-cup in appreciation of his work for the fund, which we\nhave arranged to present to-morrow afternoon to the Earl.\"\n\n\"Oh, how charming, and what a delightful surprise!\" Lady Elizabeth said.\nThese moments of joy in Henry were rare events in her existence.\n\n\"But,\" said Sadie Jones, \"isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Captain James Wynnegate to get a\nloving-cup, too?\"\n\nSir John answered, \"Oh, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only the secretary of the fund.\"\n\nThe waltz tune, with its enticing beat, grew louder and louder, and soon\nthe garden was deserted by all save Sir Charles, who remained there\nabsorbed in his thoughts.\n\nDiana, having seen her guests dancing, and fearful that her father might\nremain too long in the garden, hurriedly returned to him.  She stood in\nthe open window and tenderly watched the closely wrapped figure.  The\nmoonlight intensified his pallor; it had been an event that he should\ncome to them that night. She saw him smile.\n\n\"Well, father,\" she said, \"are you having a happy time?\"\n\nHe rose and drew her close to him.  \"My dear child, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell you how\nmuch this has pleased me. It is a great joy to me to know that my\ndaughter is married to the distinguished head of one of our great\nfamilies, a man so loved, so honored\u00e2\u0080\u0094a pillar of society, and a bulwark\nof the empire.\"\n\nNever for a moment had he suspected the misery of Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marriage.  Not\na quiver of emotion showed on her calm face as she drew her arm into his\nand said, quietly, \"Yes, father.\"\n\n\"I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forgotten your opposition to this match,\" but Charles\ncontinued, \"although I dare say you have, my dear, and I am naturally\npleased that events have vindicated me.  Your husband cuts a noble\nfigure in the world, and I am grateful beyond words to see you so\nhappy.\"\n\nAs Diana gradually led Sir Charles from his seat to the house, she again\nanswered, \"Yes, father.\"\n\nDuring the past months her life had grown more dreary.  If it had not\nbeen for Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0094dear Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0094what would she have done?  Her fragrant mind had\nnever been disloyal to Henry.  Often she had longed to go to her father,\nbut her solicitude for him prevented her from bringing disaster to him.\nAs they reached the door Lady Elizabeth called:\n\n\"Have you seen Jim, Diana?\"\n\nJim had been down in the park doing some service for a sick trooper;\nDiana explained this to Lady Elizabeth.  He had promised to return in\ntime for the dancing.\n\n\"By-the-way, my dear,\" Lady Elizabeth began, \"if you get an opportunity,\nI wish you would say a judicious word in praise of Mrs. Hobart\nChichester Chichester Jones.  Jim, you know, sets such an extraordinary\nvalue on your opinion.\"\n\nA quick feeling of dislike filled Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0094why, she could not explain.\n\n\"What do you wish me to do?\" she said.  \"Praise her American accent or\nher American money?\"  Before she had finished the sentence she was\nashamed. She really liked Sadie Jones; the sneer had been unworthy.  She\nwas about to retract her words when Jim hurriedly came up the\ngarden-walk.  As she entered the library with Sir Charles he called:\n\n\"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget our waltz, Diana.\"\n\n\"I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t, Jim.\"\n\nLady Elizabeth sank on to the stone bench.  She watched Jim, whose eyes\nwere still following Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s receding figure.  This was the moment in\nwhich she might serve Henry.  In the music-room Sadie Jones was singing:\n\n    \"Tout lasse, tout pass\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\nJim began humming the tune; he crossed to Lady Elizabeth and lightly put\nhis arm about her as he said:\n\n\"Well, Auntie mine?\"\n\n\n\n\n                             *CHAPTER VIII*\n\n\nLady Elizabeth watched Jim with curiosity. The voice from the\ndrawing-room grew louder:\n\n    \"Tout casse, tout pass\u00c3\u00a9\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\ndeeper grew Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice as he softly sang the refrain. Quite abruptly\nLady Elizabeth began:\n\n\"She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a fine woman, Jim.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Jim caught sight of Diana crossing to the piano in smiling\napprobation as the song ceased, and answered:\n\n\"Diana?\"\n\n\"Diana!  Nonsense!\"  Again she watched Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, but its grave\nserenity gave no sign.  \"I mean Mrs. Hobart Chichester Chichester Jones.\nShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quite the type that men admire, is she not?\"\n\n\"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the most offensive thing that one woman can say about another,\"\nJim laughingly replied, as he turned from watching the group in the\nmusic-room\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it, Auntie?\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"  Lady Elizabeth fidgeted; he was making it exceedingly\ndifficult, she thought, as he leaned over her, his laughing eyes teasing\nher.  \"The sensible view of things never appeals to you, Jim; so I have\nhesitated to remind you that Sadie Jones is exceedingly rich.\"\n\n\"Did you notice how deferential I was, Aunt?\" Jim lightly interrupted.\n\"Why, if you tell me more, I shall scarcely dare to speak to her.\"\n\nHe drew Lady Elizabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm through his; he knew what was coming.  It\namused him, and it also irritated him a little, but he felt very tender\ntowards his aunt.  All the boyish hurt had been forgotten.  Her great\nendurance of Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct, her indomitable resolution to keep him\nwell placed in the eyes of men, deeply touched him.  After all, in her\ndevotion to Henry there was a magnificent capacity for self-surrender.\nDuring the past winter Jim had grown strangely attached to his aunt, and\na great pity for the inevitable tragedy of her life lay deep in his\nthoughts of the proud old woman.  He patted her hand caressingly.\n\nWith almost a note of despair she said, \"And I invited her here for this\nvisit especially for you, Jim.\"\n\n\"Do you think she would care to add to her already abundant collection\nof names?\"\n\nHe would not be serious, but Lady Elizabeth took up his question\nliterally.\n\n\"I think she would be very glad to ally herself with one of the great\nfamilies of England.  Besides,\" she continued, as there was no reply,\n\"such a marriage would put you in a position to be of great service to\nHenry and the family.\"\n\nJim distinctly saw Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s purpose in this appeal. It sickened him\u00e2\u0080\u0094this\ncold, devilish selfishness that made his cousin use all things as a\nmeans to further his own ends.  His spirit rose in revolt against his\naunt, who, he now saw, was seriously asking so grave a sacrifice of him.\nHow lightly they played with human destinies!  Then he conquered his\nsudden passion.  He spoke in a tone of affectionate banter.\n\n\"You dear Aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0094Henry and the family are among the earliest of my\nrecollections.  I was taught Henry and the family before my letters.  If\nI found a stray dog, or made a toy, I was forced to hand it over to\nHenry.  Why, I remember I gave up a brilliant offer to enter commercial\nlife\u00e2\u0080\u0094far better suited to my small fortune than an army career\u00e2\u0080\u0094because\nit would not lend dignity to Henry and the family.\"  The hard tone he\nwas struggling to keep down crept into his voice.  \"The woman I marry\nwill have a right to expect more of me than a profound respect for her\nmoney and a laudable desire to promote Henry and the family.\"\n\nLady Elizabeth perceived the suppressed irritation, and was for a moment\ntouched by Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reproaches.\n\n\"One must pay something for the glory and privilege of belonging to a\ngreat family.\"\n\n\"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think we pay too great a price, dear Aunt?\"\n\n\"I have never shirked the sacrifices.\"\n\nThe worn, tremulous face looked up at Jim with eyes that were\nunconscious confessors of the bitter struggle her life had been.  He\nleaned towards her and gently took her hand.\n\n\"No, dear Aunt, you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  You deny yourself everything.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you\nthink I can see that?  You stint yourself to the point of shabbiness:\nwhy, your wardrobe is positively pitiful!  And Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0094the child has had\nno proper education, no advantages; she has never been anywhere, nor\nseen anything, nor had anything\u00e2\u0080\u0094Henry needed the money.\"\n\n\"We have been as generous to you and Mabel as we could, Jim.  We must\nkeep up the dignity and position of the head of the family.\"  Like a\nwar-horse sniffing the powder of battle-fields, at the words \"family\"\nand \"dignity of its head,\" Lady Elizabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s courage rose.  In the\nmoonlight Jim could plainly see the determined look grow on her face\nuntil it formed granite-like lines.  The fox might eat her vitals, but\nshe would not whimper.  The torch of the family was the light of her\ndeclining years, as it had been of her youth.  It was useless to argue\nfurther, Jim told himself. The music sounded a new dance.  It was an\nopportune moment to escape.\n\n\"You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been a dear\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not complaining, only I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think we have the\nright to sacrifice an amiable lady on the altar of our obligations.\"  He\ndrew his aunt towards him and leaned over the seat.  \"Besides, I have no\ndesire to marry at present, so we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t speak of this again, will we?\"\nAs he spoke he kissed her on the forehead.  \"God bless you!  And now I\nmust be off to help Di with the dancing.\"\n\nLady Elizabeth rose.  It was impossible to resist his tender charm, but\nhis evident indifference to her wishes vexed her.  He crossed to the\ncasement and Lady Elizabeth called:\n\n\"There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an occasional streak of stubbornness in you, Jim.\"\n\nHe smilingly called back.  \"I think it runs in the family, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it,\nAunt?\"\n\nAs he went into the house, he passed Henry and several of the men busily\ndiscussing the condition of the Yeomanry, and the Relief Fund that was\ndoing such excellent work.  Here Henry proved himself of worth\u00e2\u0080\u0094of his\ninterest in the work there could be no doubt.\n\nAs Lady Elizabeth stood alone in the garden, she was conscious that her\nrecent interviews with Jim had been most unsatisfactory.  He had a way\nof not taking the traditions of her life seriously; he discussed and\ndismissed them lightly.  She knew that Henry would be annoyed at Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nindifference to this fortune within his grasp, and she suspected that\nthere was a cause unknown to her for Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nervous and upset\ncondition.\n\nShe had no inclination to return to the dance; instead, she crossed to\nthe seat under the great oak-tree, and drew her lace scarf close about\nher.  The garden was quite empty.  In the distance the yew-trees, like a\nline of ghostly, fantastic figures, seemed pregnant with sinister\nforebodings.  She shivered; it was growing slightly cold.  She could\nhear the dancers, and from the card-players in the house came sounds of\nmore life and mirth.  Her recent desire to be alone deserted her\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nliving warmth of the life of the crowds within her reach attracted her.\nThe sadness of the moaning wind in the trees she could dispel by\nreturning to her guests\u00e2\u0080\u0094she would do so and assist Diana in her duties.\nAs she started to leave the rose enclosure, Henry with Sir John came\nthrough the open casement.\n\nShe noticed the strained look on Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face as he said, \"No, no, I\nhaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done it yet.  But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll prepare a statement in good time\u00e2\u0080\u0094leave\nit to me.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m getting tired of the word Fund\u00e2\u0080\u0094the demands of the work\nhave been so incessant.\"\n\nThey reached Lady Elizabeth.  Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look quickly told her that he\nwished to be alone.  She came to his assistance as she said:\n\n\"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you believe him, Sir John.  He really thinks of nothing else.\nBut won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you join the dancers? I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure Diana will need you.\"\n\nHenry quickly added, \"Do, and forget the Fund for a moment.\"  As Sir\nJohn disappeared he muttered, \"And let _me_ forget it.\"\n\nLady Elizabeth heard the last words and wondered. The ugly horns on his\nbrows showed the irritable state of his mind.\n\n\"Well,\" he quietly said, \"what did Jim say to the American widow?  It\nisn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t often that a man without a title gets a chance like that.\"  There\nwas a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s silence.  Lady Elizabeth would have preferred to have\nthis conversation at another time; her mind was anxious about Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nrecent words\u00e2\u0080\u0094what did they forebode?  But Henry settled himself in a big\nchair, and she saw that he was anxious to learn the result of her\ninterview with Jim.\n\n\"He declines positively,\" she answered.\n\nThen the passion he had been fighting to keep under broke loose.  He\nrose and began pacing the walk.\n\n\"Not an atom of consideration for me\u00e2\u0080\u0094eh?  In the hopeless struggle I\nmake to live up to the traditions of my race?\"  Henry could always work\nhimself up into a great burst of self-pity.\n\n\"Jim is an anarchist in his talk, but an angel at heart.  He always ends\nby doing the right thing.\"\n\nThis defence of Jim caused Henry to stop in his walk.  That his mother\nshould advocate the goodness of Jim was a new victory for his cousin.\n\n\"Jim likes to play the saint, confound him,\" he barked, \"but waking or\nsleeping, he never takes off his halo.\"\n\nLady Elizabeth crossed to him.  \"He says he has no desire to marry at\npresent.\"\n\n\"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the sickly sentimental pose of the man who loves a woman beyond\nhis reach,\" Henry answered.\n\nLike a flame of illumination the innuendo of his words brought their\nmeaning to Lady Elizabeth.  She remembered so much and yet so little in\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s actions of late, but all tended towards a horrible suspicion. She\ncould still see Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face as he watched Diana earlier in the evening.\nIt was not the face of a lover in the usual sense.  It was a face\nglorified by an unconscious devotion to a great ideal.  All she could\nstammer was:\n\n\"You mean\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nBut Henry, who had blurted out in a heat of temper more than he felt he\nhad reason for, tried to ignore the question and the look of sudden\nbewilderment in her eyes.  He moved restlessly in his chair as he said:\n\n\"Never mind, mother; it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter.\"\n\nBut Lady Elizabeth went to him, and, with her arms about him, whispered,\n\"My son, you are nervous, pale, distrait.  You have been so for some\ntime.  I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t spoken of it for fear of annoying you, but others are\nbeginning to speak of it.  What is it?\"  She drew his head back until it\nrested against her breast.  \"Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you trust your mother?\"\n\nInstead of a restive withdrawal from her embrace, he let her soothe his\nhead with her half-trembling hands.  Why not tell her what he suspected?\n\n\"Have you seen Jim and Diana much together?\"\n\n\"Not more than always,\" was her reassuring reply.\n\n\"But, mother, have you observed them when they are together?\"\n\nLady Elizabeth slipped down on the seat beside him.\n\n\"My boy, your suspicions are morbid and unjust. You ought to be ashamed\nof them,\" she gently urged. In her heart she feared for him and his\nhappiness with Diana.  She had seen the girl gradually sicken and turn\naway from her life with Henry.  Great provocation, she knew, had been\ngiven Diana, but at present it was wiser not to discuss this with him,\nbut to calm him.\n\nSuddenly he leaned forward and buried his face on his arms.\n\n\"Mother, I love Diana.  I have my faults, but that is the best of me.  I\nlove her desperately.  Oh, I know you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to say that at times I\nhaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t proved by my actions that I cared for her, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because I\nknew from the beginning that I never could reach her.  Does she love me?\nNo, I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t deceive myself.  She was devilled into marrying me for the\ndamned title.  I know that now.  The best I can hope for is that she\nshould not utterly despise me, and I want a chance to win her love\u00e2\u0080\u0094my\nGod, how I want it!  Everything that Jim does pleases her.  She admires\nhim; I can see it clearly.\"  He paused as the whirlwind of words swept\nfrom him; he rose, and towered over his mother.  \"That admiration\nbelongs to me.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spoiled me, mother.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always had what I\nwanted, and now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the victim of it.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m the selfish monster that\ntakes everything while St. James stands modestly in the background.  Oh,\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see you have made him her hero, not me?\"\n\nHe began to move restlessly about the rose paths, Lady Elizabeth\nfollowing.  Indulgently she linked her arm through his.  Although a fear\nwas beginning to persuade her of the truth of his wild words, still, she\nargued, he greatly exaggerated.  That he cared so deeply for Diana\npromised well for the future, and, with her aid, Diana would soon be\nconvinced of Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worthiness.\n\n\"My dear boy,\" she said, \"is that all you have to worry over?\"\n\n\"No, mother, no\u00e2\u0080\u0094I wish to God it were.\"\n\nShe caught hold of him almost savagely, \"Ah\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" she gasped.  Then the\napprehensions that had torn her for days had been justified.  She feared\nto question further.  An overwhelming dread held her in its torturing\ngrip.  Henry started as though to leave her; his face was averted, she\nturned him towards her.\n\n\"Money again?\" she asked.\n\n\"You know what the demands on me are.  I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disgrace my family by\ngoing into bankruptcy, and I had to have money.  Well\u00e2\u0080\u0094I was foolish\nenough to borrow\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nLady Elizabeth knew instinctively the words that would follow.  Her\nhands clinched his arm so tight that he shrank under the pressure.\n\n\"Borrow, mind,\" he continued, \"some of the Fund\u00e2\u0080\u0099s money.\"\n\n\"The Relief Fund?  Oh, Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nThe despair and horror of her tone caused him to put his arms\nprotectingly about her.  Even in his own blind fury at fate he could see\nher shrink from her stately strength into a feeble old woman.  He tried\nto reassure her.\n\n\"Oh.  it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really all right, mater.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be able to replace it.\n\n\"How?\"\n\nShe clung to his arm.  He could hear the quadrille\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last quarters\nbeginning; it would be impossible to continue this conversation much\nlonger.\n\n\"You wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand, mother.  You see, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a stock transaction,\nbut it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all right\u00e2\u0080\u0094bound to be. Hobbes, of Simpson & Hobbes, you know,\ngave me the tip.  It was absolutely inside information.\"\n\nLady Elizabeth loosened her hold, and with a hopeless gesture moved\naway.  Henry read her lack of faith in the enterprise.\n\n\"Oh, I took the trouble to verify it.\"  He did not admit, however, that\nhe had sought Petrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice only after the plunge, when the waiting\nhad grown too fearful.  \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m expecting a telegram to-night\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the\nreason I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m nervous.  But I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have enough to put back the sum I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nborrowed, and a nice little fortune besides.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you worry.\"  But\neven as he spoke the comforting words he seemed to lose the confidence\nwhich he was vainly trying to assume. The telegram should have arrived\nin the afternoon. He knew that Petrie, if his investigation had been at\nall hopeful, would have sent a reassuring word. Then, that the strength\nof his mother, upon which he had so often leaned, should crumble away as\nhe confessed to her, that he should be forced to carry her anxieties\ninstead of receiving her support, terrified him with its significance.\n\nIt was all quite palpable to Lady Elizabeth.  His drawn face with eyes\nlike burned-out flames showed how the fever of unrest and fear consumed\nhim.\n\n\"Henry, you are trying to reassure yourself, not me,\" she said.\n\n\"No, no, mother, it isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that.\"  But it was useless, he could no longer\nplay a part.  \"Yes, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re right,\" he acknowledged as he threw himself\ndown on the great stone bench.  \"My God, the consequences!\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nconsequences!\"\n\nAnd Lady Elizabeth stood dumb and helpless. For the first time he held\nout his hands to her, and she was unable to grasp them in support.  She\ncould offer no respite to the torture of suspense he endured.\n\nAs they stood in silence, Diana came from the pergola, \"Dear people, are\nyou moon-struck?  Our guests are missing you.\"\n\nWith an effort Lady Elizabeth turned, \"Is the dance over?\" she said.\n\nHenry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words followed close: \"Have we been gone very long?\"\n\n\"Oh no\u00e2\u0080\u0094but you see they have stopped bridge, and the men want to talk to\nyou about the Fund. They are all so proud of our extraordinary result.\nThey want a statement published so that they can gloat over the envy of\nthe other regiments.\n\n\"Published\u00e2\u0080\u0094a statement!\" but Diana, who was bending over some roses,\nhardly noticed the strained speech, and Lady Elizabeth motioned him to\nrestrain his agitation.\n\n\"First, I believe,\" Diana continued as she seated herself, \"there is a\ncommittee or somebody to go over the accounts and what do they call\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0094?\"\n\n\"Audit them,\" Henry found himself mechanically saying.\n\n\"Yes, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s it.  They want to know when it will be convenient to-morrow\nfor you, Henry.\"\n\nQuite vaguely he said, \"Oh yes\u00e2\u0080\u0094for me.\"\n\nIn his work for the Yeomanry and his characteristic British loyalty to\nhis men, Diana found one great virtue to be proud of in Henry.  She\nrealized this as she heard the men discussing his efforts.  For several\ndays a growing feeling of pity for his misspent life had taken hold of\nher as she saw what he really could do when he willed.\n\n\"You are a great man with the Tenth, Henry,\" she said.  \"To hear them\ntalk, one would think you carried the regiment in your pocket.  And the\ndear mother there\u00e2\u0080\u0094to see her listen to your praises!  Oh, well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nvery beautiful\u00e2\u0080\u0094you both had better go and glory in some more.  The taste\nfor adulation will grow insatiable after this\u00e2\u0080\u0094won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\"  As she spoke\nshe lifted her long, slender hands and fastened them across her brows.\nHenry came to her.  She was very beautiful; an unusual pallor gave her\nface a delicate spirituality.  In the dim light her soft white\ndraperies, the fluttering scarf ends, and the wreath of green leaves\nmade her seem half a sprite.\n\n\"Won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you return with us, Di?\"\n\n\"No\u00e2\u0080\u0094I have a headache.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll stay here in the air for a few moments.\"\n\nAs she spoke, Jim came towards them.\n\n\"The next is our dance, Diana.  Will you come?\"\n\nHenry answered for her with unmistakable sarcasm.\n\n\"Perhaps Jim will stay with you, Di, as you have a headache.\"\n\nAnd Jim innocently replied, \"With pleasure; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve really been doing duty\nquite assiduously in the way of dancing.\"\n\nHe crossed to Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side.  Lady Elizabeth, who had been trying to\ndivert an awkward moment, drew her arm through Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  Henry looked at\nhis mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, which grew tender as her eyes rested on him.\n\n\"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid my wife does not share your pleasure in my praises, mater.\"\n\n\"Oh yes,\" Diana answered, \"but you must not expect a wife to have the\nillusions of a mother.\"  It was lightly said, to cover up an apparent\neffort on Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part to cause an embarrassing moment.\n\nLady Elizabeth took up the cue.  She glanced from Jim to Diana, but they\nwere beginning to talk; she almost drew Henry forcibly away as she said\nwith forced gayety, \"No\u00e2\u0080\u0094no one can love you as your mother does, dear.\"\n\nShe little knew the prophetic truth of her words or to what length her\nmother-love would lead her before another day had passed at the Towers.\n\n\n\n\n                              *CHAPTER IX*\n\n\nThese moments of respite from the dancing were peaceful, Diana thought,\nas Jim drew a chair forward and seated himself beside her.  She was\nstrangely unsettled to-night.  Her head ached slightly, it was true, but\nshe was conscious that ever since Lady Elizabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remark concerning Jim\nand Sadie Jones, a curious irritation had possessed her.  She didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nstop to reason it out, but plunged at once into the heart of the matter.\n\n\"I congratulate you, Jim.\"\n\n\"On what?\"\n\n\"Your brilliant prospects.\"\n\n\"We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never met\u00e2\u0080\u0094shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know them if I saw them.\"\n\nSo Diana knew too of the scheme to secure a fortune for the house of\nKerhill.  Jim was curious to learn her point of view.  There was a new\ntouch of bitterness in Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice that puzzled him.\n\n\"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let them beat you down in the price, Jim. If you sell your sweet\nyoung life, let it be at a good round figure, for our sakes.\"  The\nscornful mirth of her last words was unmistakable.\n\n\"I shall always be a joke to you, Diana.\"\n\n\"Well, if our whole social fabric isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a joke,\" Di interrupted, \"pray,\nwhat is it?\"\n\n\"I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t belong to the social fabric.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an outsider.\"\n\nAgain she feverishly interrupted.\n\n\"Oh, you can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t escape.  You are up on the block. Look your best, and try\nto bring a fancy price.  We have always sold our women, and now we have\ntaken to selling our men.\"\n\nFor a moment he wondered if she, too, approved of the fortune hunt.\n\n\"Are you in the Chichester Jones conspiracy, too?\" he asked.\n\n\"Certainly,\" the answer came, but with it a look that plainly\ncontradicted the words.  She was in wild spirits, he could see; he let\nher run on.  \"You are a monster of selfish obstinacy, Jim.  Your\ninability to grasp your own best interests and ours\u00e2\u0080\u0094is a proof of a\nfeeble intellect\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a wicked heart.\"\n\nGayly he entered into her mood.  \"Well, Diana,\" he said, \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an amiable\nbrute.  If you insist upon it, perhaps\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\"Good,\" she cut in quickly as she jumped up on the seat and clung to an\noverhanging bough.  \"Let me be the auctioneer; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get you a good\nprice.\"  Blithely assuming the voice and manner of a professional\nauctioneer, she began: \"Step up, ladies\u00e2\u0080\u0094step up, ladies.  Please examine\nthis first-class specimen of the British aristocracy.  He is kind and\ngentle, sound in mind and limb; will travel well in double harness\u00e2\u0080\u0094has\nblue ribbons and medals, and a pedigree longer than your purses.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfor sale; how much am I bid\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nJim, who laughingly followed her words, interrupted in mock seriousness:\n\n\"One moment before you knock me down.  Have you considered the existence\nof the American Peril? These Yankees are driving the English girls out\nof the home market.  I believe in protection for the home product by an\n_ad valorem_ tax on the raw material and exclusion for the finished\nproduct\u00e2\u0080\u0094in the shape of widows.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a patriot.  God bless our English\ncommerce\u00e2\u0080\u0094homes, I mean.\"\n\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s burst of nonsense was finished by a \"Hear, hear\" from Diana.  Then\ntheir laughter rang out merrily.  Diana clung to the swaying branch;\nJim, below her, like Henry, noticed the ethereal quality of her beauty\nthat night.  She put out her hands to him.\n\n\"Please,\" she said, and he helped her down.  Their light-heartedness\nseemed to desert them.  Mechanically he kept her hand in his, held\nspellbound by her gracious charm.  Diana withdrew her hand as she said,\n\"Jim, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a boy and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never grow up.\"  Then, because she wished\nhim to reassure her of his distaste for the proposed marriage, she said,\n\"Sadie Jones is the chance of a lifetime and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll miss it.\"\n\nJim only half heard her words.  He was conscious of a strange dread of\nremaining longer alone with her.\n\n\"How do you know I will?\" he said.\n\nAll her tender faith and belief in him was in her answer: \"Oh, Jim, I\nknow you.\"\n\nDid she though?  Did he know himself?  What was this wild new feeling of\nfear, of sweet, elusive pain? His words gave no sign of the tumult of\nhis thoughts.\n\n\"Do you?  Well, you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do me a greater service than to make me\nknow myself.  Fire at will.\"\n\nDiana, too, was conscious of a strange undercurrent to their lighter\ntalk.  She was aware of Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s searching glances, but, like him, she gave\nno sign of the vague uneasiness that would not be stilled.\n\n\"Shall I, really?\" she questioned.\n\nJim nodded.\n\n\"Remember, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve brought it on yourself.\"  She seated herself close to\nthe sundial, and half leaned against it.  Jim was facing her.  \"Well, to\nbegin with, you will never wholly succeed in life.\"\n\n\"Dear me, I meant surgery, not butchery, Di.\"\n\nShe paid no heed to the interruption.  \"You are not spiritual enough to\ncreate your own world, and you are too idealistic to be happy in this\nfrankly material world.  You have temperament and sentiment; they are\nfatal in a practical age.\"  She paused; there was no denial from Jim.\nAs she waited for him to speak, her eyes rested on the decorations\nglittering on his coat.  \"Your breast is covered with medals for\npersonal courage, but you could never be a great general.\"\n\nHe almost stopped her with a reminder of the days on the Northwestern\nHills, but a certain truth in all that she said kept him silent.  His\nmemory went back to the hours in which he had fought\u00e2\u0080\u0094even at the\nsacrifice of himself\u00e2\u0080\u0094to save his men.  He heard her say:\n\n\"You could never sink your point of view to the demands of necessary\nhorrors.  Confronted with the alternative of suffering, or causing\nsuffering, you would suffer.\"  She rose, and, as though peering into the\nfuture, said, \"You are marked for the sacrifice.\"\n\nHer face shone as though illumined by a clairvoyant power of spiritual\ninsight.  She seemed to have forgotten the present and stared straight\nahead, trying to see into the heavy mists that enveloped the coming\nyears.  Jim made an effort to relax the nervous tension of the moment.\n\n\"What a rosy, alluring picture!  A failure at everything I touch, eh?\nHave I one redeeming virtue?\"\n\nBut although the voice that spoke was light with raillery he was\npossessed by an uncontrollable agitation. She stood with a haunted look\nof such intensity on her face that he became conscious only of an\ninfinite desire to protect her.  As he came close to her she was\nthrilled by the vibrating sympathy that drew them together, and raised\nher eyes to his.  The strong, tender face of Jim, to which she had so\noften turned in her days of unspoken despair, gave her the comprehension\nand sympathy that were denied her by another.  She thought of the\nexpression of Sadie Jones\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes as she sang:\n\n    \"Tout pass\u00c3\u00a9, tout lasse.\"\n\nDiana knew that she had been sending her song out into the night as a\nmessage to Jim in the garden.  She thought of the unacknowledged sense\nof comfort that Lady Elizabeth experienced when Jim came to visit them.\nWithout him, what would the days be?  She shuddered at the desolation it\nmight mean to be without this reliant, forceful friend.  As it all\nflashed through her mind, she said:\n\n\"You have one triumphant quality, Jim.  Whether it will add to your sum\nof suffering or compensate for all the rest, who knows?  You have one\ninevitable success.\"\n\nShe paused, but the rustling of the tree-tops prevented either of them\nfrom hearing Henry as he came from the pergola.  Diana moved a step\nnearer to Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0094Henry did not make known his presence. Quite simply and\nsincerely she said:\n\n\"You will always have the love of women, Jim.\"\n\nSomething snapped in Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain.  He stood hypnotized by a stronger\nforce than his own will; he could not speak.  Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice sounded like\nthe cracked clang of a jarring bell in a golden silence.\n\n\"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a dangerous gift, Jim.  Professional heart-breakers ought not to\nbe allowed in other people\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preserves.\"\n\nHenry spoke quietly, but he was consumed by a mad, unreasoning fury.\nDiana simply said, \"Oh, I was just trying to tease Jim about Sadie\nJones.\"\n\nJim started towards the house, intending to leave Di with Henry.\n\"Teasing\u00e2\u0080\u0094a ruthless grilling, I call it.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been vivisected, Henry;\nit\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not a pleasant experience, believe me.\"\n\nBut Henry, who was looking from Diana to Jim, with unmistakable meaning,\nsaid, \"You stopped at an interesting\u00e2\u0080\u0094perhaps a critical\u00e2\u0080\u0094moment, Diana. I\nsuppose I ought to beg your pardon.  Where lovers are involved, the\nhusband is an intrusion, almost an impertinence.\"\n\nJim turned and retraced his steps.  Diana did not move.  Their eyes were\nfastened on Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, now flaming with passion.  All Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwomanhood was battling within her; her face grew tense, her eyes like\nblack pansies.  She seemed unconscious of Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence; all her being\nwas concentrated in the challenge of her eyes as she let them strike\nback her answer.\n\n\"You are making a grave mistake, Henry.  One that you will regret as\nlong as you live.\"\n\nShe could say no more; she wished to escape.  Why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Jim speak?  She\ncould hardly see him.  An overwhelming desire to leave both men before\nthe sinking trembling of her body should overpower the strength of her\nwill, enabled her to reach the house.\n\nThe men were alone; both had watched Diana gain the doorway.  Neither\nseemed capable of helping her.  Jim was the first to move; he came\ntowards Henry with a quick, resolute step.  Suddenly he became conscious\nof a new knowledge that checked his speech.  He could only stare at\nHenry, while the wild beating of his heart tormented him.  Much had been\nrevealed to him regarding his feeling for Diana, during the past hour.\nHenry was watching him furtively.\n\n\"And now, sir,\" he began, \"I will listen to you. You have had time to\nthink up a plausible explanation.\"\n\nFor Diana and his aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake he must be calm, so Jim only answered, \"I\nwould not insult you or Diana by offering one.\"\n\nThe quiet scorn of Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apparent indifference maddened Henry.\n\n\"Oh, indeed!\"  He drew a chair forward.  \"Sit down and confront the\ntruth,\" he said, as he sat on the bench opposite.  He was trembling\nviolently.  Jim still maintained his composure.  Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clinched hand\nstruck the table as he sneeringly exclaimed: \"You owe everything you are\nto me.\"\n\nWith the bitter knowledge of how much he had sacrificed for the family,\nquick came Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reply:\n\n\"You mean everything I am not.\"\n\nBut Henry did not notice the truth of Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words. Ever since his\nboyhood, when he had first abused his power as master of the Towers, he\nhad been irritated by the opposing point of view of his cousin\u00e2\u0080\u0094had\nrebelled at Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s success in making a place for himself in the world\nwithout his help.\n\n\"You have lived in my house,\" he said, \"enjoyed my bounty, and now\u00e2\u0080\u0094damn\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say it\u00e2\u0080\u0094don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!\"\n\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words hit at Henry across the table like points of forked\nlightning.  All the pent-up feeling of years seemed concentrated in the\nutterance.  He was leaning far across the table, his face twitching with\ndisgust at Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suspicions.  Like Diana he sickened at the thought\nthat Henry could believe him capable of playing so degrading a part in\nDiana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life.\n\n\"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\" he continued, \"or I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll forget myself\u00e2\u0080\u0094forget the respect we owe\nher\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"  Even as he spoke he knew that Diana was the supreme concern of\nhis life.  That he loved her, he now realized; all the misery that might\nensue was engulfed in the supreme surrender he made to his love, the\nlove that unconsciously for the past months had become part of his life.\nBut with this knowledge came clearly the injustice that Diana and he\nwere being subjected to, by a mind that could not conceive of the purity\nof her friendship.  \"You\u00e2\u0080\u0094why, you\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" he began again, then with difficulty\ncontrolled himself.\n\nIt was impossible to continue this conversation further; any moment they\nmight be interrupted.  He could not determine the course of his future\nat the moment, but he could save her the discovery of his secret\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\ncould save her further humiliation from Henry.\n\n\"Henry, you must have been drinking.  Go to Diana at once, before she\nrealizes what you said, before it is too late.  Go and make your peace\nwith her for this outrage against her.\"  While he spoke he was trying to\nescape from the knowledge the night had brought.  He watched Henry, who\nin a dogged tone said:\n\n\"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too late now.  It has always been too late\u00e2\u0080\u0094with me\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Di.\"\n\n\"Nonsense,\" Jim said.\n\nHenry mumbled on as though he were only half aware of the words he was\nspeaking.\n\n\"Unless you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d intercede for me?  She\u00e2\u0080\u0099d listen to you.\"\n\nJim rose.  To obtain peace and dismiss from Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind all suspicion\nthat might harm Diana was his one desire.  But almost before he was on\nhis feet, Henry sprang up and held Jim with both hands while he\nspluttered in frantic abandon:\n\n\"No, no\u00e2\u0080\u0094I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust you\u00e2\u0080\u0094I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t trust you.\"\n\nWith a quick movement Jim flung Henry off.  It was useless to expect\nsanity from this trembling, fanatical creature.  Without a word or look\nhe left him, and Henry stood watching Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s receding figure down the\nalley of trees.\n\n\"And now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve driven out of her life the only interest in it, and she\nwill hate me for that, too.\"\n\nThere was only one thing for him to do\u00e2\u0080\u0094he must get to his own quarters\nand send some message of excuse to his mother.  He turned into a side\npath. He could hear the dance music and the gayety of the groups\nscattered near the pergola.  Diana was there. He could see her, pale but\nwith perfect poise, assisting Lady Elizabeth.  Even Jim was at Lady\nElizabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side.  He envied them their control; in his condition it\nwould be folly for him to venture near them.  As he turned towards the\nhouse he met Bates carrying a telegram.\n\n\"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been looking for your lordship,\" he said. \"The message came about\nhalf an hour ago.\"\n\nHe remembered Petrie ind the expected word as he tore open the wire.  It\nread:\n\n\n\"Impossible to give any definite news.  Still probing matter.  Will be\ndown to-morrow afternoon.\"\n\n\nGod!\u00e2\u0080\u0094and he had this to add to his night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vigil! Bates left him.  He\nthrew out his arms as he stumbled into a chair.  He knew and admitted\nthat he alone was responsible for it all.  But he did not know that he\nhad fanned to life the love that Diana and Jim now acknowledged to\nthemselves for the first time.  That night their fight for happiness\nbegan.\n\n\n\n\n                              *CHAPTER X*\n\n\nIn the Towers four desperate souls fought their battle, and to none of\nthem did the dawn bring comfort.  In her room Lady Elizabeth sat\nmotionless before her open window, and, like Agrippina, saw the long\nline of destruction that the child she had borne had brought to her and\nto her house.  Shortly before the end of the evening\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entertainment,\nshe had received a message from Henry, begging to be excused, as a\nmatter of great importance had arisen which prevented him from remaining\nwith his guests.\n\nOnce she thought of venturing to go to him, as she listened to his\nrestless pacing above her, but fear of his displeasure and a physical\nshrinking from a painful scene forced her to keep her watch alone.\nTo-night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s confession of his use of the Fund was the gravest of his many\noffences; she could not shake herself free of its grave consequences.\nAlong with it came the memory of the faces of Jim and Diana as she had\nlast seen them at midnight.  The guests had departed; Diana was entering\nher own apartments, while from the landing Lady Elizabeth could see Jim\nbelow her as he started for the garden.  Both their faces were stamped\nwith a new, vital truth which, in its immensity, they seemed to find\ndifficult to grasp.  She recalled the wistful, inquiring expression of\nDiana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look as she turned to call her good-night to Jim. Even more\nvividly she recalled the answer of his eyes. The mute, unspoken thoughts\nthat lay there were haunting her now with their tragic possibilities.  A\nnumb fear possessed her.\n\nAbove her, Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s monotonous steps continued; her imagination began to\nplay tricks with her.  The steady tread above seemed to change into the\ntentative, faltering toddle of a baby boy; she remembered that the room\nover her was the old nursery, now used by Henry for his own apartment.\nHow often she and his father had listened and rejoiced at the stumbling\nefforts which they could hear in the early morning! The terrible\nsympathy of a mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sorrowing womb, that can reach the most poignant\nof all human anguish, caused her suddenly to start to her feet; a\nphysical craving to hold again the tiny body firm against her own, and\nease this suffering, overpowered her.  She could hear the broken steps\nof the long ago; she could see only the naked, mottled body of the\nsturdy chap that she had so often clasped close and smothered with her\nkisses.  She stretched out her arms as if in search of it.  The longing\nto touch again the soft warm flesh of her own creation became intense,\nfrom her wildly beating heart to the tightly contracted throat there\ngrew a spasm of pain that ended in a long, broken sob.  She forgot all\nthe years of suffering, the disappointments, and to-night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crowning\ntragedy of Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wilful treachery to her and his house.\n\nShe was the young mother again.  The half shy, inquiring face of the\nbabe with its tight corkscrew curls, as she had seen him first walk\nacross the long nursery to fall into her arms at the open doorway, was\nall that she could remember.  Other ghosts crowded into the room; the\nhusband of her love-days\u00e2\u0080\u0094for Elizabeth Kerhill had passionately loved\nher boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father\u00e2\u0080\u0094stood, as he often had stood, close behind her at the\nnursery door and joyed with her at the beauty of its tiny occupant.  The\nold wound, which nature mercifully in the passage of years had\nalleviated, again ached as it had in the first hours of her great sorrow\nat his death.\n\nSuddenly the pacing above ceased.  She became conscious of a terrible\nanxiety to know why; she feared the stillness; the steady beat had been\nan unconscious comfort.  Her tired brain grew more fanciful.  Did she\nimagine or did she really see the pale spectre of her husband at the\nfarther end of the room beckoning her to follow him?  He seemed to open\nthe door into the corridor and disappear into the gloom.  There was a\nslight movement from above, significant in its abruptness; it was as\nthough a quick decision had been made by Henry.  Down the corridor she\nfled, obeying a compelling instinct.  The pale mist of the first streaks\nof dawn was struggling through the distant windows.  She remembered a\nsimilar hurried rush to the nursery, when the tiny, twisted body was\nattacked with writhing convulsions. Quickly she sped along the hallway,\naround a twisted enclosure, and up the broad staircase until she reached\nthe nursery.  Without a pause she swung open the heavy oak door; then\nshe knew why the warning had come to her.\n\nAt the creaking of the door, Henry started; he was unaware that it had\nremained unlocked.  For a moment he stared at his mother as though she\nwere an apparition.  He was standing near the open drawer of a huge\ndesk; the glint of fire-arms in it shone clear against the flicker of\nthe spluttering candles.  He made no attempt to move.  His eyes were\nheld by the figure at the door, but no words came from the moving lips\nof Lady Elizabeth.  Instinctively, both their glances went to the open\ndrawer with its certain means of death.  Henry turned away; he tried to\nclose the case.  Through the silent room came the sobbed name of his\nchildhood days.\n\n\"Ba-ba!  Ba-ba!\"\n\nHe felt her strong arms fasten tight around him; unresisting, he was\ngathered up close against the trembling body of his mother, as she drew\nhim down into a big settle.  He made no attempt to speak.  He heard only\nthe name of his babyhood in his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moans, as she pressed his tense\nface to hers, kissed the faunlike ears, while her hands strayed, as they\nused to do, over the long limbs that, relaxed, lay helpless against\nhers.  The old nursery again held her treasure, and mechanically the\ntremulous lips fell to crooning a long-forgotten lullaby.\n\nGradually he slept with his head on her breast. Straight and stiff the\nearly shadows found her, while the bitter tears furrowed her face, as\nshe held her child, warm and alive, against her heart.  During the long\nhours of her vigil she heard distinctly the crunching of footsteps on\nthe gravel-walk outside as some one passed and repassed the east wing.\nBut she was little concerned with the world without.\n\n\nBelow, unconscious of the tragedy so close to him, Jim, whose step it\nwas Lady Kerhill had heard on the gravel-path, fought through the long\nnight for his right to happiness.  His entire horizon seemed blocked by\nthe unyielding figures of Lady Elizabeth and Henry; behind them,\ntantalizing him with the sweetness of the vision, he could see Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nface illumined with its new light of wonder.  The heavy dews, which gave\nto the old garden its fragrant, green, sweet odors, drenched him as he\npaced along the path under the giant trees.  He was insensible to his\nwet clothes\u00e2\u0080\u0094to the tumbled hair which the dampness knotted about his\nhead in kinky curls.  The tangle of his thoughts proved too difficult\nfor him to unravel; the night had been so charged with emotions that he\ncould hardly look truthfully into his own heart.  The hours passed as he\npaced restlessly, dazed and overwhelmed by the chaotic uprooting of all\nhis being.  Aimlessly he at last wandered towards the Fairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Corner,\nand sought rest on the rudely fashioned seat, dented and marked with his\nboyish carvings.  There he lay haunted by intangible dreams until,\novercome by weariness, he crept close into his old corner and slept.\n\n\nThe strong orange shafts of sunrise were lighting up the hill-side\nopposite Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s window as she stealthily crept down and let herself out\nof the silent house into the garden.  The mounds close to the Towers\nwere covered with great splashes of heather, while the moor beyond\ndipped and stretched far away like a trailing, purple, overblown,\nmonster flower, which seemed, mushroom-like, to have sprung up during\nthe night. Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first sight of the brilliant coloring that came every\nJuly to the heather-covered hill-side, brought now as always bitter\nmemories of her first summer in Scotland, where as a young bride the\nillusions of her virgin mind and heart had been shattered by Henry.\n\nShe turned away from its flaunting beauty with a shudder.  No memories\nof the past had been hers during the night; why should she allow the old\npain and heartache to come back?  She alone in the great house had given\nherself up to delicious reveries that tempted her; every thought of\nHenry, her father, and the ties that bound her, she ignored.  She never\nquestioned what had changed her since she had left Henry, outraged at\nhis vile suspicions.  Why probe into the cause of her happiness?  Enough\nthat she could rejoice, silently, if need be, without a reason\nacknowledged even to herself, for her joy.  But the dawn brought with it\nonly feverish longing to reach the cool of the hill-side, and now the\nblooming riot of purple tones had struck at her like a menacing ghost.\nShe plunged into a thicket, and, sinking knee-deep in its luxuriant\ngrowth, made her way across a yellow meadow.  Finally she reached the\ncopse of trees through which she could see the Elizabethan gables of the\nback of the house.\n\nOh, the beauty of the unstained day!  Like every weary wayfarer\nexploring for the first time since childhood the fresh virgin\ncountry-side, her soul cried aloud its appreciation of this beauty of\nsoft green, wet glistening flowers, crystal clear air, and what is\nutterly unknown save to the frequenters of the first hours of dawn in\nforests and glades, the ecstatic perfume of the early breezes.  Across\nthe hedges from their kingdom, the flower-garden, came these ripples of\nscented air, heavy with the breath of honeysuckle, rose, phlox, and\nheliotrope.\n\nLike Jim, she unconsciously turned to the Fairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Corner.  As she\nreached the narrow aperture, and its wet earthy smell drowned the sweet,\nsensuous odors of the garden blossoms, she espied the sleeping figure on\nthe old bench.  At the unexpected discovery she gave an involuntary\nexclamation.  Jim was lying on his back, with his head on his arm, all\nthe wet stain of the night passed in the garden showing on his unchanged\nevening clothes, while the unkempt hair gave a curious boyishness to his\nface.\n\nDiana waited for him to move, but her surprised ejaculation had failed\nto awaken him.  How big and wonderful he was!  The thick lashes swept\nhis brown face with its dull touch of red showing under the olive skin.\nAs she bent over him and was about to touch his hand to arouse him he\nopened his eyes.\n\nHe had been dreaming that he was in the hospital in the Hills after the\nfight, and in his delirium he was back at the Fairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Corner with\nDiana\u00e2\u0080\u0094and there she stood looking at him, but his eyes seemed unable to\ngrasp the reality of the moment.\n\n\"Jim, Jim,\" she said.\n\nIt was no dream.  With a rush of memory it all came back to him.  He\nquickly rose to his feet and came towards her, impelled by an\nuncontrollable force.  Cobwebs of sunlight were making glinting spaces\nagainst the gray-and-green enclosure; a movement began in the tree-tops\nthat brought back the childish reminiscence of the rustling fairy wings.\nHe forgot everything.  He only knew that she stood there like an essence\nof delight to ease his aching being. The still wonder of the evening\nbefore was again shining in her luminous face.\n\nHe lifted her hands to his shoulders, and held them fast there.  To her\nawakening womanhood he seemed like a young god of nature, who had bathed\nin the primeval springs and had arisen glorified and overwhelming in his\nforcefulness.  They stood speechless, their gaze fastened each on the\nother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, while the moments slipped away.  How long they stood there\nneither realized: the burning intensity of the moments told them more\nthan any words could have conveyed. Both now knew the truth\u00e2\u0080\u0094it downed\nthem with its unflinching eyes; they knew that they were peering close\ninto the core of life, that they had touched at the vital springs of the\nGreat Game.  Strong and incessant as the beat of the swaying tree-tops,\nthe bitter knowledge was forced upon them that they could no longer,\neven to themselves, play a part.  Their months of unconscious\nself-deception had that night been slain; each knew that love triumphant\nhad come into his own.\n\nFrom the camp in the park beyond came the sound of the bugle calling the\nmen to their early morning duties.  It roused Jim and Diana to the\nconsciousness of the workaday world.  Diana was the first to move; she\nslipped her hands away from his shoulders, while she still had the\nstrength to do so.  Jim silently started towards her, his eyes showing\nthe surrender of his love.  She could read all that they asked; her name\nbroke from his lips in tender reiteration.\n\n\"Di, dear\u00e2\u0080\u0094dear Di!\"\n\nBut this time the out-stretched hands waved him back.\n\n\"No, no!\" she cried, and down the long copse she fled from him.\n\nAlone, Jim realized that they had been on the edge of a great precipice.\nGradually it came upon him that there was only one way to save\nhimself\u00e2\u0080\u0094to save Diana; he must go away.  When, how\u00e2\u0080\u0094it all mattered\nlittle\u00e2\u0080\u0094later he would decide that.  He managed to reach his room\nunobserved.  How could he face the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsibilities, he asked\nhimself, as he heard rising from below the sounds of the life of the\nhouse, and knew that the duties of the camp were awaiting him.\n\nTowards noon in his tent a letter was brought to him.  It was from\nDiana.  Trembling he tore it open and read:\n\n\n\"DEAR JIM\u00e2\u0080\u0094Our meeting this morning has revealed me to myself.  If you\ncan find it in your interest, I hope you will leave England.  I cannot\ntrust myself to say anything more but good-bye.  DIANA.\"\n\n\n\"Revealed me to myself,\" he repeated.  \"Oh, Diana, Diana,\" he whispered.\n\nYes, he must go.\n\n\n\n\n                              *CHAPTER XI*\n\n\n\"When Mr. Petrie comes, show him to me here,\" Henry gave orders to\nBates.\n\nIt was late in the afternoon and he was alone in the rose enclosure\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nlibrary had proved too stifling. He had managed to attend the\nafternoon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s drill, and discharge without comment the duties required of\nhim by his guests.  The Bishop and a great number of visitors were still\nin the park.  Diana, on the plea of illness, had remained in her room,\nbut had sent word that she would be down at tea-time.  Absorbed in his\nown reflections Henry hardly observed that Jim was passing the entire\nday in camp with the troops.  That the farce of the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pleasure was\nnearly over, was his most comforting thought; a few hours more and the\nhouse-party would disperse.  If only Petrie would come.\n\n\"No news, good news;\" over and over he tried to comfort himself with the\nold saw.\n\nLady Elizabeth, if she had remembered, would have warned him of the\nintended presentation, but the night with its torturing memories had\nmade her forget utterly the surprise arranged by the Bishop and Sir\nJohn.\n\nHenry looked at his watch\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was past four. Would Petrie never come?  He\ncursed the hour in which he had listened to the tempting voice that\nurged him to speculate in a mine controlled by Hobbes. He remembered the\nnight he had finally agreed to enter into the game, and\u00e2\u0080\u0094then, a loss\nhere and an unexpected blow there had disastrously crippled his\nresources.\n\nMoney had been necessary to protect the already invested fortune.  The\nFund was under his control\u00e2\u0080\u0094Why not use it temporarily?  He used the word\n\"borrow\" to his mother, and he had tried for weeks to ease his mind with\nthe same word, but he knew that the world had an ugly name for such\n\"borrowing.\"  Wherever he turned he could see five blazing letters\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nflaming stigma was beginning to burn in his brain.  Was there no way of\nprotecting himself a little longer?  He closed his eyes and tried to\nthink.\n\nNo, it would be impossible to evade the request of the committee.  To\nelude the young curate, Chiswick, had not been difficult.  On the plea\nof his devotion to the cause, he had succeeded in controlling all the\npapers and accounts for the past week, but now\u00e2\u0080\u0094a cold perspiration began\nto ooze over his body; it was followed by hot flashes that tormented him\nlike the five fantastic little demons ever before his vision, as they\ntwisted, contorted, shaped, and reshaped themselves into one hideous\nimputation.  An hour before, he had promised to give to his secretary\nthe keys of his desk; to put off the auditing any longer would have\naroused suspicion.  His only hope now was that perhaps the absorbing\ninterest in the last day of the manoeuvres would give him another\ntwenty-four hours leeway.  If Petrie brought reassuring news he might be\nable to realize the necessary amount and prevent discovery.  He poured\nhimself some brandy.  Just as he raised the glass, Bates announced:\n\n\"Mr. Petrie, my lord.\"\n\nThe glass slipped to the ground; Bates stooped to remove the fragments.\nJohnston Petrie advanced with perfect composure and shook Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ntrembling hand.\n\n\"Your lordship,\" he said.  Then both men waited until Bates disappeared\ntowards his quarters.  To Henry the moment seemed an eternity.\n\nThey were alone, and yet neither spoke.  Through Petrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind ran a\nmemory of having stood there long ago and conferred with the late Earl,\nwhile the man before him as a boy sat on his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knee.  He knew\nnothing of Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of the Fund; he only knew that he was bringing\nnews of a big loss to his client.  Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face as he grasped Petrie to\nsteady himself, told him something of the importance attached to his\nreport.\n\n\"Well, Petrie, well?  Speak\u00e2\u0080\u0094man.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you see you are killing me?\nHobbes\u00e2\u0080\u0094what of Hobbes?\"\n\nTruthfully, Petrie answered: \"Hobbes is a fugitive\u00e2\u0080\u0094the whole scheme was\na gigantic swindle.  Every penny invested is irremediably lost.\"\n\nAlmost before he had finished speaking, from the various side-paths\nleading towards them came the sound of voices.  Henry made a staggering\nmovement as though to escape towards the house, but his way was blocked\nby Sadie Jones, who had gone at the Bishop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request to fetch Diana.  As\nHenry stared at the advancing groups he saw himself already convicted.\nWhat was the meaning of this unusual gathering of officers and men\nsilently falling into lines behind the circle of friends who surrounded\nhim?  He supported himself by his chair.  Petrie quickly realized the\nsituation as he saw a sergeant approaching with an open case containing\nthe gift of the big loving-cup.  He tried to reach Henry, but Lady\nElizabeth anticipated him.  She had recalled too late the demonstration\narranged to take place at tea-time. There was a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hush.  A little\nway off the servants were gathering to witness the honor shown to their\nmaster, and the enclosure about Henry was quickly crowded.\n\nHenry clung to his support.  He could distinguish all the faces quite\nplainly, except Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  Where was Jim?  Muffled, as though coming from a\nlong distance, he heard the Bishop\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice:\n\n\"My lord, I am so overwhelmed with the significance of this delightful\noccasion and my own imperfections as a speaker, that I could have wished\nmy task to have fallen into better hands.  But when I was approached in\nthe sacred name of charity and of that noble cause so dear to all our\nhearts, the relief and succor of the widows and orphans of the brave men\nwho have given their lives in the smoke of battle, I felt I ought to be\nsustained by your own noble example.  I will not dwell on the lofty\nnature of your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s services to the Fund\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nHenry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impassiveness began to desert him: \"Liar! liar!\" shrieked the\nlittle demons as they came in a swarm towards him.  He closed his eyes.\n\n\"In accepting this very beautiful loving-cup,\" droned the Bishop.\n\nBut it had gone too far.  His greatest pride\u00e2\u0080\u0094his regiment, his men,\ntheir Fund\u00e2\u0080\u0094was his greatest dishonor.  Better discovery\u00e2\u0080\u0094anything rather\nthan this awful continuation.  He swayed\u00e2\u0080\u0094Petrie caught him; there was a\nmoment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s surprised ejaculation from the crowd.\n\nLord Kerhill was ill.  The heat had been intense during the afternoon\ndrill.  It was noticed then that he was unwell\u00e2\u0080\u0094and so the tactful\nexcuses went from one to another as Henry was assisted by Petrie to the\nlibrary.  But Lady Elizabeth, with some hurried orders to Petrie, turned\nto the assembled guests.\n\n\"My lord Bishop, some one has said \u00e2\u0080\u0099speech is but broken light falling\non the depths of the unspeakable.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  This in thanks for the great honor\ndone our house. I am sure my son\u00e2\u0080\u0099s inability to reply is more due to\nyour eloquent tribute than to his slight indisposition. Won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you allow\nthe tea to be served?  Lord Kerhill will, I am sure, join you very\nshortly.\"\n\nImperiously she took command of the situation, and soon the waiting\nservants were dispensing tea, while the guests discussed the beauties of\nthe cup that lay in its velvet case, as if nothing unusual had happened.\nThen quietly she made her way to Henry. She found him alone, and\nmotioned him to follow her into a small room adjoining the library; it\nhad been a prayer-closet in the past for a devout Kerhill, but during\nrecent years it had been used as a smoking-den, with old sporting-prints\nand curious whips and spurs in place of the _prie-dieu_ and the\ncrucifix. Drawing the bolt across the oak door, Elizabeth Kerhill turned\nand faced her son.\n\n\"Henry, what is it?\"\n\n\"The South American Security Company\u00e2\u0080\u0094a swindle.  Hobbes a fugitive\u00e2\u0080\u0094for\nme exposure.\"\n\nLady Elizabeth realized that if salvation were to come to him it must be\nthrough her.\n\n\"To prevent this exposure, you must not lose your self-control.  We must\nthink\u00e2\u0080\u0094not feel\u00e2\u0080\u0094think what we can do,\" she began.\n\nAnd Henry answered, calmly, \"I must blow my brains out.\"\n\n\"Dear God!\" her heart prayed as she watched him. His dull impassiveness\nfrightened her more than any madness of rebellion; he meant this\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was\nno idle boast.  Had she only delayed, not prevented, the contemplated\ntragedy of the night before?  Tightly she buckled on her armor of\nmother-love.  She must fight\u00e2\u0080\u0094fight him\u00e2\u0080\u0094the world, if necessary, but she\nmust win.  She put all the sickening hurt and broken courage behind her.\nShe must obtain help\u00e2\u0080\u0094from whom?  In the mean time she must distract and\narouse him from this awful apathy of resignation to his disgrace.  While\nthese thoughts were flashing through her brain she answered:\n\n\"If\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" she paused, she could not say the word. \"If\u00e2\u0080\u0094_that_\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" she half\nwhispered, \"would cover up the shame\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  No; no Earl of\nKerhill must go into history as a\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\"Thief!\"  Henry supplied the word.  It was a relief to speak it.  \"You\nmight as well say it\u00e2\u0080\u0094no one else will hesitate to do so.\"\n\nHis voice shook, but he still maintained his stoicism.\n\n\"You had no intention to do wrong, my poor boy, I know it, but no one\nwill believe that but your mother.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my fault too in some way, I\nsuppose.\"  The agonized mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consciousness of failure in shaping her\nchild\u00e2\u0080\u0099s character broke from her.  \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d willingly take the blame on my\nshoulders if I could.\"\n\nHe held her hands tighter.  She knelt beside him.\n\n\"Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s see.  No one has had anything to do with the Fund except you,\nChiswick, and Jim\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094-the thought of Jim brought reassurance.  Jim perhaps\ncould help them in some way to evade discovery. \"Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jim,\" she\nreiterated.\n\nHenry answered her unspoken thought.  \"Jim and I quarrelled last night.\"\n\n\"Quarrelled\u00e2\u0080\u0094about what?\"\n\n\"Diana.\"\n\n\"Diana?\"\n\n\"They were spooning last night\u00e2\u0080\u0094I caught them. He loves Di\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094and under his\nbreath he cursed him. She hardly heard the last words.  Jim loved\nDiana\u00e2\u0080\u0094her resolve was formed.  She must see Jim.\n\n\"Henry, try to control yourself and return to our guests.  Let no one\nleave this afternoon under the impression that you are in trouble.\"\n\n\"Why\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" he began to expostulate\u00e2\u0080\u0094but she had already left the\nprayer-closet and was pulling the faded bell-rope in the library.  A\nservant quickly answered.\n\n\"Tell Captain Wynnegate that I wish to speak to him here.\"  Quietly she\ncommanded Henry, \"Leave this to me.\"\n\nAt first he was inclined to refuse; then touched by her supreme\ndevotion, and partly because he dreaded an interview with Jim, he agreed\nto return to the garden.\n\n\"You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve pulled me out of many a scrape, mother,\" he said, as he drew her\nclose to him.  \"God\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you gain time for me in this\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094with the words,\nhope began to revive.\n\n\"Go,\" she only answered as she pointed him to his duty.\n\nFurtively, from behind the curtains, she watched him join the Bishop.\nShe dreaded to lose sight of him; the awful vision was ever before her.\nHer mind swung chaotically from her fear of the previous night to the\nsalvation that must be gained for Henry. Could Jim help?  What if all\nthat remained of the estate were to be sold, and Jim were willing to\ngive what he could\u00e2\u0080\u0094what if the years that followed were bereft of all\nsave honor!  Why should she not attempt this?  But even as she reasoned\nshe knew it was useless; all save the entailed portions of Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ninheritance were involved.  She heard Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s step ringing along the\ncorridor.\n\n\"Bates says you want me, Aunt.\"\n\nAs Jim stood before her, his face, with the purple shadows under his\neyes and its grim resoluteness, told her much.  Yes\u00e2\u0080\u0094he loved Diana.  Her\nkeen eyes, that took in every phase of the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nature and every\nexpression of his face, could easily see the desperate marks which the\nstruggle of the night had left upon him.\n\n\"Jim, Henry tells me that you have quarrelled; but for the moment we\nmust forget all personal differences. We are face to face with a crisis\nwhich affects us all; you alone can help us to save the family from\ndishonor.\"\n\n\"Ah, so Henry has been gambling again,\" Jim vaguely answered.  Did this\nmean further anxiety for Diana?  He was conscious of a curious\nlight-headedness that made all of the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work\u00e2\u0080\u0094even this possible\nunhappiness for his aunt and Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0094seem faint and blurred.  The\ndead-level of his tone made Lady Elizabeth answer, sharply:\n\n\"Worse\u00e2\u0080\u0094infinitely worse than a card debt.  Henry has borrowed an\nenormous sum of money which it is absolutely impossible for him to\nrepay.\"\n\n\"Borrowed?  I had no idea Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s credit was so good.\"\n\nElizabeth Kerhill saw that his mind was only half grasping what she was\ntrying to tell him\u00e2\u0080\u0094that he thought it only another of Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npeccadilloes.  She laid her hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"Henry used the Fund to try to cover the loss of his last possession,\nwhich he has sunk in a huge speculation.\"\n\nJim quickly looked up.\n\n\"The Fund\u00e2\u0080\u0094what Fund?  Not the\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\"Yes, the Relief Fund.\"\n\n\"Why, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s embezzle\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nBut his aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feverish hand stopped the word. She clung to Jim as she\npiteously said, \"Henry intended to replace it.\"\n\n\"Poor Diana!  poor Diana!\"  The words slipped from him and then as he\nlooked at the terrible eyes full of this bitter knowledge he quickly\nthrew his arms protectingly about his aunt.  \"Poor Aunt! poor Aunt!\"\n\n\"Yes, we women must bear our sins alone, and you men make us bear yours,\ntoo.\"\n\n\"You have had your share, Aunt,\" he answered, as he caressed her hand.\nHe found it difficult to say more; he was so tired, yet he must struggle\nto grasp what it all meant.\n\n\"It will ruin your prospects, too, Jim, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid. It will be\nimpossible for you to remain here after this.\"  She began to understand\nwhy she had sent for Jim.  Like him, her mental condition was at its\nlowest ebb\u00e2\u0080\u0094she, too, was exhausted.  What were Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s thoughts?  Why\ndidn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he speak?  There had been a new resolve on his face when he first\ncame in response to her summons.\n\n\"Oh, it doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter about me,\" Jim roused himself to say.  \"I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nrepresent anything.  Besides\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" he hesitated.  He was leaving England\u00e2\u0080\u0094why\nnot tell the truth?  The tragedy that the night had wrought was far more\ndifficult for him to face than this crime of Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  Then into his\ntired brain came the knowledge of what all this would mean to the woman\nhe loved.  \"But Diana\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094he continued\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"she is a proud woman; her father is\na proud man\u00e2\u0080\u0094he is in delicate health.  It will kill him.  You took from\nDiana her own proud name to give her ours. God\u00e2\u0080\u0094this scandal will ring\nfrom one end of the empire to the other.  Di, Di\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" he could think only\nof her now.  \"She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a city set on a hill\u00e2\u0080\u0094she\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be the object of pity\nand the tattle of every back stair in England.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s monstrous\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nmonstrous!\"  Suddenly in the midst of his vehement despair for Diana he\nbecame conscious that his aunt was watching him.  His entire cry had\nbeen selfishly for Diana.  \"Oh, forgive me\u00e2\u0080\u0094forgive me!\" he pleaded.\n\"And you\u00e2\u0080\u0094what will become of you?\"\n\n\"I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe I could survive it.\"\n\nWhy was she reflecting Henry, she asked herself. Did she hope to\naccomplish with Jim what Henry last night had done with her?\n\n\"Hush, hush!  You must not talk like that,\" Jim entreated.\n\nHer strength was beginning to fail her.  Jim placed her gently in a\nchair.\n\n\"Jim, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you help?  Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think of some way to help us all?\"\n\n\"What money I have wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a drop in the bucket.  But you can have\nit.\"  He added, quietly, \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m leaving England\u00e2\u0080\u0094don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t question me why\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going.\"\n\nJim was going.  He meant to sacrifice himself in any case to his great\nlove.  If he had only gone before this discovery had been made\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nunspoken thought that had been struggling at the back of her\nsubconsciousness began to form words that, if she dared, would tempt him\nto a greater sacrifice.  Dare she go on?  Even as she hesitated Henry\nmight be\u00e2\u0080\u0094almost she prayed that last night\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intervention had been\ndenied her.\n\nKnowing what she did, she must try to save her son\u00e2\u0080\u0094save her house.  She\ndrew a quick breath. She rose and crossed to Jim, who was leaning\nagainst the mantel; his figure drooped inert and helpless, hers grew\nstronger and more rigid until she stood over him like a menacing figure\nof fate.  She took both of his unresisting hands in hers.  There was no\nmistaking the meaning of her words.\n\n\"Jim,\" she whispered.  \"I know you must go. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve known it for days.  As\nit must be, can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think of some way to help\u00e2\u0080\u0094us\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094she hesitated on the\nword. \"Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you make a greater sacrifice?  You are the only one who can\nsave us from ruin and dishonor. Will you?\"\n\nIn silence he looked into her unflinching eyes. From her feverish brain\nto his strained sensibilities came the unmistakable message.  Was his\nlove great enough to serve to this end\u00e2\u0080\u0094to make this supreme immolation?\nHe threw back his head and closed his eyes.  The seconds slipped\nby\u00e2\u0080\u0094neither relaxed the hold each had on the other.\n\nYes, to serve\u00e2\u0080\u0094to give\u00e2\u0080\u0094that was love.  Renunciation would mean the\nsalvation of so many\u00e2\u0080\u0094to Di, and the life of the delicate old man so\nclosely entwined with hers.  The honor of his house\u00e2\u0080\u0094this proud old\nwoman!  Through Henry, peace at least to Diana. What mattered his life\nnow\u00e2\u0080\u0094why not?  But what he did must be done at once, he could brook no\ndelay. Again he looked deep into his aunt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do it.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only way\u00e2\u0080\u0094the only way.\"\n\n\"God bless you!\u00e2\u0080\u0094God bless\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" she sobbed, as she clung to his hand.\n\nBut Jim evaded all further words.  \"Leave me. Later I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see Henry.\"\n\nThe dressing-bell sounded.  He led her to the door, opened it, and\nwatched her pass down the long corridor with its portraits of the dead\nWynnegates lining the walls.  But Jim made no effort to obey the summons\nof the bell.  He returned to the prayer-closet; he wanted to be alone.\n\nIn his dressing-room Henry received two messages. One was from his\nmother, it said, \"Courage\"; the other note read: \"Come to the\nprayer-closet at ten.\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jim.\"\n\nAt dinner Diana strained her eyes in vain down the long table, and then\nwatched the great doors for Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s appearance, but to no purpose.  Had he\nobeyed her note?  By the desolation of her heart she knew that she had\nnot wished such swift obedience.\n\n\n\n\n                             *CHAPTER XII*\n\n\nThe clock was striking ten, and Jim was waiting for Henry in the\nprayer-closet.  He had arranged all the details of his departure.  It\nwas as though he carried a dead soul, so calm and void had been his\nfeelings for the past hours.  He had stayed away from the dinner-party\non some pretext, and his man had already started for London with his\nluggage to be left at his club.  When the servant returned the following\nmorning, as he supposed to accompany his master back to town, he would\nfind him gone.  By the time the discovery of the deficit was made, Jim\nwould be aboard the steamer that was to carry him across the Atlantic.\n\nSounds from the drawing-room told him that dinner was over.  He sat\ntwirling his travelling hat; on a chair near by lay his coat.  The\nchimes of the last notes of the church-bell were dying away as Henry\nhurriedly entered.  Jim looked up and studied his cousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face, and he\nsaw by his manner that some word of hope must have reached him from Lady\nElizabeth.  Save for a half-suppressed exclamation from Henry as he\nnoticed Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s travelling clothes, neither of the men spoke.  Henry flung\nhimself into a chair; he could feel Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes on his face.\n\n\"Damn it, why don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you speak?\" he finally gasped, when he could no\nlonger endure the situation.\n\nJim quietly asked, \"Have you made your peace with Diana?\"\n\n\"What would be the use now?\"  He knew that his mother had told Jim the\ntruth.  Why did Jim not refer to it?  Perhaps there was, as his mother\nsuggested, a way out of this; if so, why in Heaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name should the\ntorture be continued.  But Jim remained silent.  \"You think of nothing\nbut Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0094Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0094Diana.\"  With the last call of her name it became a\nwail.  Henry had learned during the past hours what suffering could\nmean\u00e2\u0080\u0094he was beginning to know what life tempered with discipline might\nhave meant for him.  \"When I stand dishonored before the world, it will\nbe easy for you to take her from me. Is that what you are thinking?\"  He\nbegan excitedly to pace the room.\n\n\"Not exactly,\" Jim answered, without moving from his bent position; \"I\nwas wondering whether you can be trusted with Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future.  I believe\nyou love her after a fashion.\"\n\nHenry stopped in his walk in front of Jim.  \"And I know that you love\nher.\"\n\nJim moved from the position that told how spent he was, and raised\nhimself to his cousin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s height. \"Yes,\" he said, \"but not quite in the\nway you mean. I am about to show you how I love her.\"\n\nSomething in the simple directness of his words made Henry lower his\neyes.  He threw himself into a chair and with averted head listened to\nwhat his cousin had to say.\n\n\"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too late for Diana to find out what a blackguard you are, Henry.\"\nHenry only dropped his head lower on his hands.  \"I wonder if you will\nenter into an honest conspiracy to keep her in happy ignorance to the\nend,\" Jim continued.\n\n\"What are you driving at?\" Henry asked.  He almost knew the words that\nwere to follow, but he hardly dared believe that what he surmised could\nbe true.\n\n\"I am thinking that under certain conditions I will disappear\u00e2\u0080\u0094leave\nEngland; as secretary of the Fund my action would be practically a\nconfession of guilt.\"\n\nJim could hardly hear the strained question that followed.\n\n\"Your conditions?\"\n\n\"That you give up gambling of every kind; that you drop your mistress,\nshut up her establishment, and give up your other liaisons for good and\nall; that you make a will leaving everything you have, except what is\nentailed, to Diana; and that you give me a written and signed confession\nthat you embezzled this money; that for the above considerations I\nconsented to assume the appearance and responsibility of the guilt, and\nthat if you do not keep the agreement you have made with me, I am at\nliberty to appear at any time and make known the truth.\"\n\nHenry rose and stood looking silently at Jim. Vaguely he began to grasp\nthe tremendous power of Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loyal love.  He could find no word\u00e2\u0080\u0094the\nclock chimed the quarter-hour.\n\n\"Well?\" Jim asked.\n\n\"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s for her, Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0094for her\u00e2\u0080\u0094I understand that, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try and have the\nfuture make up for the past, so that you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never regret this.\"  His\nvoice broke\u00e2\u0080\u0094he leaned towards Jim and tried to grope for the hands that\nhe could not see\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"I was a dog to say what I did, but, by God! I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll keep\nmy part of the agreement.\"\n\nJim nodded\u00e2\u0080\u0094he was beyond emotion.  \"Good; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bargain.  Go to your\nroom, make out a paper such as I have indicated, sign it and bring it to\nme here. Be quick,\" he added, \"and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get away at once.\"\n\nThis time it was Jim who dropped into a chair and averted his head to\navoid seeing Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out-stretched, pleading hand.  He never raised his\neyes until he heard the door click, then he went and unlocked a side\nentrance that led from the prayer-closet to the other side of the\ngarden, and with his watch in his hand leaned against the open door and\nwaited. Henry must not be too long; he was to leave by the midnight\ntrain, but before that he must make his pilgrimage.  Across the garden\nhe could see the waving tree-tops beckoning him, calling him with the\nmysterious powers of the night.  Yes, he would make his start for the\nnew life from the Fairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Corner that led\u00e2\u0080\u0094whither?\n\n\nTowards the carriage-drive Diana tenderly assisted Sir Charles, followed\nby Bates.\n\n\"Must you really go, father?\"\n\n\"Yes, my dear, I must keep good hours, you know. These two days have\nbeen a great dissipation for me; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been well repaid; I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell\nyou how much the delightful episode of the loving-cup pleased me. So\nnow, good-night, my love.\"  They had reached the entrance, \"No, no,\" Sir\nCharles protested as Diana started to walk to the carriage with him,\n\"Bates will take care of me.\"  Then he gathered her close in his frail\narms as he kissed her, and whispered, full of the pride he felt in the\nhonors done to the house of Kerhill, \"You see, it was all for the best,\nmy dear\u00e2\u0080\u0094all for the best.\"  And Diana made no answer.  Ever since she\nhad sent the note to Jim revealing the truth of her tortured heart she\nhad seemed to gain a spiritual strength that helped to calm the aching\ncall of her senses.  She dared ask no question concerning Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s absence,\nand her heart mocked her again with the truth that she had not meant him\nto obey her so implicitly.\n\nShe saw Sir Charles drive away.  \"Dear father,\" she whispered, \"he must\nnever know\u00e2\u0080\u0094never know\u00e2\u0080\u0094but it was all for the worst, my dear, all for the\nworst.\"  Tears began to stain her face; they were the first in many\ndays.  She tried to control the passion of her grief but it was\nimpossible; quivering sobs shook her in an hysterical outburst.  To\nescape from the possible eyes of any chance meeting she quickly sought\nrefuge in the rose-arbor.  Hidden completely, she gave herself up to the\nrelaxation of her sorrow. Finally, spent with her tears, she leaned\nagainst the damp foliage of the rose-screen, and an aftermath of calm\nfollowed her outburst.  Suddenly she became conscious that Sir John\nApplegate and Mr. Chiswick were crossing to a bench near the sundial.\n\n\"My dear Chiswick,\" her cousin John was saying, \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m greatly distressed.\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been obliged to ask you to give me a few moments here, and, indeed,\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve asked Lady Elizabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0094as Kerhill seemed so ill to-day\u00e2\u0080\u0094to join us\nhere.\"\n\nDiana could distinctly hear every word, but with her tear-stained face\nit was impossible for her to make known her presence.\n\n\"You see, Chiswick,\" Sir John continued, \"I presume that as Lord\nKerhill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s secretary you had his accounts in such shape that we could go\nover them at a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s notice.  When the keys were sent me this evening\nI gave an hour to glancing over the accounts before meeting the auditing\ncommittee to-morrow; as I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just told you, they seemed in a frightful\ntangle, and\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\"But, as I explained a moment ago, Sir John,\" Chiswick interrupted, \"I\nreally know nothing about the Fund; it was a pleasure for the Earl to do\nall the work\u00e2\u0080\u0094a labor of love\u00e2\u0080\u0094and he took the matter quite out of my\nhands.  Captain Wynnegate, as secretary of the Fund, and Lord Kerhill\nhave had absolute control of the business side of it.\"\n\n\"What you tell me amazes me; but no doubt there is an explanation which\nwe will have from Kerhill later.\"\n\nAn intangible presentiment began to fasten its web about Diana.  Lady\nElizabeth came from the house; both men rose, and Diana watched eagerly.\n\n\"Lady Elizabeth, believe me I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m exceedingly sorry to trouble you, but\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\nthen Sir John Applegate quite brusquely said: \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had the books for\nthe Fund\u00e2\u0080\u0099s accounts, and there is, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m afraid, trouble ahead for our\nYeomanry.  Lord Kerhill seems ill from overwork with the troops, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve\nhesitated to trouble him to-night.\"\n\nLady Elizabeth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brows contracted; so it had come so soon.  She must act\nat once\u00e2\u0080\u0094why not?  Jim had agreed: perhaps he had already gone\u00e2\u0080\u0094everything\nwas at stake\u00e2\u0080\u0094one small misstep might prove fatal\u00e2\u0080\u0094how far dared she\nventure?\n\n\"What you tell me comes to me as no great surprise,\" she said.  Both men\ndrew nearer to her, Diana strained to hear the low words.  \"The cause of\nKerhill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indisposition this afternoon was due to this sudden discovery\non his part.  Need I say, as Captain Wynnegate had charge of the books,\nwhat it means to Henry?  He and his cousin are alone responsible, so my\nson feels that the honor of our house is involved.  To-morrow he\nintended to lay the case before you; he will.  I only ask that to-night\nyou will keep the matter quiet until our guests have departed. Perhaps,\nafter all, an investigation will prove quite satisfactory and the\nshortage may be adjusted.\"  She spoke more directly to Sir John;\nChiswick, after all, could do little harm.  \"Indeed, I feel it is in all\nprobability a mistake, the result of overtired nerves.\"  Sir John\nlistened, he had a great respect for Elizabeth, Countess of Kerhill;\nseriously he answered:\n\n\"I feel anxious, but you may rely absolutely on me. In the morning I\nmust see Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0094will you tell him to meet me with Captain Wynnegate?  The\nmatter must be laid before the committee; there may be a leakage in some\nout-of-the-way corner of another department.\"  Lady Elizabeth\nacquiesced.  Sir John went on, \"I could only find confusion in the\nbooks; consequently, I feel we need not be too seriously alarmed.\nBy-the-way, where is Captain Wynnegate?\"  Lady Elizabeth shook her head.\nInto both the men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faces came a look of curious surprise.\n\n\"He has not been seen the entire day, save for a little while quite\nearly, in his tent.\"  Diana could feel the condemnation in the silence\nthat followed.\n\n\"Mr. Chiswick, Mr. Chiswick,\" it was Mabel\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice calling from the open\ncasement.  \"You promised to come back for the charades.\"\n\n\"Yes, you must both return\u00e2\u0080\u0094they will need you. And, after all,\" Lady\nElizabeth whispered as they started for the house, \"we have no doubt\nbeen anticipating difficulties that do not exist.\"\n\nThe voices died away, and Diana left the rose-bower. She had but one\nthought\u00e2\u0080\u0094she must find Jim at once. Why, oh, why, had she written the\nnote of the morning? She stumbled across the heavy, thick sward.  In the\ndistance she could see a figure; it looked like Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s; he was coming\nfrom the Fairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Corner over the green to the entrance which in the\nmorning had let her out on to the purple moor.  Quickly she hurried to\nhim, staining her gown and delicate slippers in the wet grass.\n\n\"Jim, Jim,\" she called, \"where are you going?\"  As he turned she came\nclose to him and repeated her question.\n\n\"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m taking your advice, Diana; I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m leaving England\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\"Oh no, no,\" she eagerly interrupted, \"I thought so, but now you must\nstay\u00e2\u0080\u0094stay to protect your honor.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just heard that the Fund\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nnot you, I know, Jim, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not you\u00e2\u0080\u0094not you\u00e2\u0080\u0094you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" her\ndespairing cry stopped.  Still he made no effort to comfort her.\n\nFinally he said\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"I must go.\"\n\nWhat did it mean?  That he should go after the revelation she had made\nto him\u00e2\u0080\u0094she understood that; but now with his honor at stake it was\ndifferent. Into her mind there flashed an unanswerable suspicion.  Was\nthere some reason why he had so eagerly acceded to her request; that\neven now, when she asked him to remain, he still stood mute at her\nentreaties?\n\n\"Whether you go or stay, Jim, I do not expect ever to see you alone\nagain, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad of this chance to bid you good-bye\u00e2\u0080\u0094forever.  I can\nnever, never believe that you are\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jim, if your hands are clean, if you\nhaven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t robbed the soldiers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 widows and orphans, you may kiss me\ngood-bye.\"\n\nInto his eyes came the desire of his love as she had seen it in the\nearly morning in the Fairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Corner. This time she did not move; but\nJim only bent low over the out-stretched arms as he answered, \"I must\ngo,\" and went away from her.\n\nThe circle of his boyhood was complete.  Again he went along the same\nlane that he had travelled ten years before; again the desolation\nbrought by his departure from his home, his country, hurt and bruised\nhis spirit.  Instead of the dawn, it was midnight, with clouds sweeping\nsinisterly over the light of the heavens, and instead of a boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\noptimism he carried a man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disillusions.\n\nFrom the park the light of the tent fires sent out flames that illumined\nthe roadway, the swaying and rustling of the heavy trees made whispering\nsounds. Once at a turning he heard a boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice in the camp ringing out\nhigh above the moaning of the trees:\n\n    \"Oh, Tommy, Tommy Atkins, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a good \u00e2\u0080\u0099un, \u00e2\u0080\u0099eart and \u00e2\u0080\u0099and,\n    You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a credit to your country and to all your native land.\"\n\n\nHe clutched his arms about his head to deaden the sound and hurried on\nout into the roadway, stumbling and half-falling over the gnarled roots\nof the ancient trees.\n\n\n\n\n                                *EXILE*\n\n\n\n\n                             *CHAPTER XIII*\n\n\nLike a Tanagra figurine, Nat-u-ritch stood silhouetted against the\ngolden light of the afternoon.  She was small and slender, and her\npointed face, in spite of the high cheek-bones, was delicately modelled.\nThe eyes were long, but fuller than the usual beady eyes of the Indian\nwoman.  They seemed far too big in proportion to the tiny person whose\nbody was swayed by the stifling breezes that swept over the plains,\nraising a suffocating cloud or alkali dust.  The heavy, embroidered,\none-piece gown clung to and slapped against the slight form, wrapping it\nin lines of beauty.  Long, twisted ropes of blue-black hair hung dank\nand straight on both sides of her face and reached to her knees.\n\nAs the wind blew her gown one could see the copper-colored legs, and\nthrough the scant sleeves could catch a glimpse of the immature\nred-bronze arms of the young girl.  In her hair a turquoise strand\nrepeated the touch of blue that was woven and interwoven in the beading\nof her gown.  She was standing near the trail that led to Maverick.  To\nthe left and to the right the plains stretched into an eternity of\nspace. Nat-u-ritch shaded her eyes with straight, stiffened fingers, and\nfrom under the set hands gazed over the country.  Towards the west a\ncircular cloud, repeated at intervals, told her that horsemen were\nmaking their way to the cow town.  From behind a wickyup close to her\nemerged an Indian chief\u00e2\u0080\u0094heavy, tall, with the sublime dignity of the red\nman, unimpaired even by the halting, swaying walk that told of his\nsurrender to the white man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fire-water.\n\nQuietly Nat-u-ritch watched her father, Tabywana, mount his pinto pony,\nhis flapping scarlet chaps gleaming against the white body of the\nanimal.  He looked neither to the right nor left, nor behind him, as\nNat-u-ritch followed with her eyes his disappearing form. It was\ntwenty-six miles into Maverick, and she knew she must follow the trail\nthat led there, but she made no movement yet towards departure.\nImmovable, she stood and watched from under rigid hands an alkali\nwhirlwind swallow up the horse and his rider.\n\nHer brain was busy with the problem that lay before her.  For two days\nCash Hawkins, the bad man of the adjoining barren land, had been with\nher father; for two nights Tabywana had drunk from the bottle that the\nwhite man had brought to him.  Not once for forty-eight hours had her\nfather called her to him, not once had he likened her to the flower of\nthe tree of his love\u00e2\u0080\u0094the spirit-mother.  She clinched her long, narrow\nhands until they tore the fringes of her robe.  The pleading, dumb look\nof her dark eyes gave way to quick defiance; they seemed to become\nchasms of gloom, unfathomable but determined; they showed the decision\nand strength of which her resolve was capable.\n\nHer father was to sell that day a large herd of cattle to Cash Hawkins.\nIntuitively she knew what the two days\u00e2\u0080\u0099 visit from Hawkins would mean\nfor them\u00e2\u0080\u0094despair when her father realized the trick the white man had\nplayed on him, scarcity of food and many privations for her, then long\nweeks of silent suffering for both.\n\nStill she stood staring into the winding, desolate land, the stretching\nheavens, the stretching plains\u00e2\u0080\u0094both flat, straight, unbroken, like two\nskies.  A world might be above one or under the other.  Could this\nintermediate space of ambient atmosphere lay claim to a life of fact and\nreality?\n\nBut no such thoughts came to Nat-u-ritch as she watched the sandy face\nof the country.  The desert was her home.  She had toddled across its\nburning ground, following, as far as her baby strength would permit, her\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pony.  In the solitude of the waste land she had grown into\nwomanhood.  She knew that to-day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dreariness could be broken until the\nentire place echoed and re-echoed to the life of the men whose cattle\nthundered at their heels.  She had heard the desert answer to the\nfanatical outburst of her tribes; had seen the white men drive her\npeople farther and farther back.  For her and her people it had been\ntheir refuge.\n\nSuddenly she stretched out her delicate arms.  Her figure grew erect.\nFrom the distance came the distinct beat of horse\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hoofs; it passed so\nclose within her vision that she could easily distinguish the features\nof the rider.  He was a stranger who had recently settled there, the\nstranger whom she had first met at a bear-dance down at the agency.\n\nShe remembered that with the squaw\u00e2\u0080\u0099s privilege of choosing her partner\nshe had selected him.  She remembered his eyes.  As she did so her own\nturned and followed the man who, unlike the other horsemen of the\nprairie, rose in his stirrups, and into her sphinx-like face came a look\nof unutterable yearning.  She watched the clouds of dust envelop him as\nthey had swallowed up her father, but this time she no longer stood\nstaring into the prairie.  Swiftly she caught her pony, mounted him, and\nlet him gallop across a trail that led to a short cut to Maverick.\n\nFor a long time she lay flat on her animal, the hot sun sizzling down on\nher clinging figure.  She only drew her hair as a veil over her face,\nwhile her wistful eyes watched the stranger across the plains as she\nsped close on his track.  She was glad that she was gaining ground, too\nlong had she lingered after her father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure.  She soon reached\nthe short cut, and a wise smile lighted up her face.  She would be in\nMaverick ahead of the man riding across the plains, and she wondered\nwhether she would see him at the Long Horn saloon.  Then the smile died\naway; she was not going to Maverick for that purpose.  First she must\nfind and guard her father from Cash Hawkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s machinations; and then\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\nShe tightened her hold on her pony.  She gave a curious low cry to the\nanimal.  His ears stood erect in answer as Nat-u-ritch flashed across\nthe sand track.\n\n\nThe man on the horse only vaguely saw Nat-u-ritch. His thoughts were\nbusy with the wearying business of the day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shipping of cattle.  It was\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second year at his ranch.  When he left England he did not arrest\nhis journey until he reached the Far West\u00e2\u0080\u0094that Mecca of all Englishmen.\nWith the small sum of money that he had lifted from his bank, he had\npurchased a ranch near Green River, and under the name of Carston had\nbegun forming the ties that now made up his life.\n\nAs he rode his face and body showed the beneficial results of his work\nin the open.  The cow-boy clothes seemed to have become almost part of\nhim.  A certain neatness and precision in his mode of wearing the\npicturesque garments of the plains alone differentiated him from the\nhundreds of wearers of flapping leather chaps, flannel shirt, sombrero,\nand loosely knotted kerchief.\n\nJim was wondering if his men had reached Maverick. He had sent Big Bill,\nhis foreman, on ahead of him with a message from him cautioning them to\nbeware of being drawn into a quarrel with Cash Hawkins, who he had\nlearned would be there.  For days the \"boys\u00e2\u0080\u0099\" anger had been incited by\nthe discovery made by Jim and Big Bill that Cash Hawkins had been mixing\nhis cattle with theirs, for Hawkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gain.  This complaint of\n\"rustling\" he found was not uncommon.  Its penalty when proven was not a\npleasant one; the law was not consulted\u00e2\u0080\u0094punishment was meted out by the\ncow-boys themselves. But for the present Jim preferred to avert a fight\nwith Hawkins.  In the future he meant to take greater precautions to\nprotect his property.\n\nAs Jim rode he planned out many details of his new life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work.  Thus\noften for days all other thoughts would be blotted out.  It was a big\ngame to fight and win in this barren land.  It absorbed all his time and\nvitality, and memories of dew-drenched England were burned out in this\ndry, brilliant land where the tender half-light was unknown and where\noften his English eyes yearned in vain, when he abandoned himself to the\npast, for a touch of the soft gray of his own country in protest against\nthe hard brilliance of the sun and unending sand plains.\n\n\n\n\n                             *CHAPTER XIV*\n\n\nThe Overland Limited swayed, creaked, and then with a grunting of many\nchains drew to a sudden stop before the Long Horn saloon at Maverick.\nFrom the window the passengers peered at the desolate cow town and\nwondered how long they were to be delayed.\n\nIn their private car at the rear Diana, Henry Kerhill, and Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncousin, Sir John Applegate, rose from their seats to study the\nshipping-point for cattle, so novel in its environment, as indeed their\nentire journey in America had been for the past months.  The death of a\ndistant relative on Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side, who had left her an unexpected legacy,\nhad enabled her to retrieve to a great extent their cramped fortunes.\n\nLady Elizabeth had lived only a short time to enjoy the new improved\ncondition of affairs.  She died in the year following Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure\nand vicarious disgrace.  During the months previous to her death she had\ngrown grimmer and held herself more aloof.  A stroke of paralysis one\nmorning made her bedridden and speechless; a merciful third stroke\ncaused her death within a month after her first attack.  She never\nspoke, and seemed to find no consolation save in Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence.  The\ntrip to America for a much-needed change was principally taken, however,\non account of Henry, whose nervous condition the medical attendants\ndeclared most serious.  The two years had made scarcely a perceptible\nchange in Diana; in Sir John none at all.  But in Henry an oppressive\nmelancholy was rarely broken by the old flashes.  Towards Diana he had\nfaithfully kept his word to Jim.  A truce was accepted, and he never\nceased in his pathetic endeavors to try to make her happy.  If neither\ncould honestly lay claim to a real joy of life, still they had peace and\ndignity.  As he stood near the window, the strong light showed how much\nthinner and lined was his face.  A touch of gray was distinctly visible\nalong his temples and was beginning perceptibly to streak his dark hair.\n\n\"My, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a corker!\" Sir John gasped, as he put his head out of the\nwindow and the blinding heat beat down on him.  There was a smile from\nDiana at Sir John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s acquired Americanism.  More British than the\nUnion-Jack itself, yet he was keen to gain knowledge of the new country,\nand long conversations with the servile black Sam were enlarging his\nvocabulary. All three watched with curiosity the ramshackle hostelry,\nwhich they could plainly descry from one end of the car.\n\nDiana turned to the men: \"Do let us see the place. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve always longed to\nhave a real adventure at a way-place off the beaten tourist track.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nso tired of the sights that are arranged for one to be shocked at\u00e2\u0080\u0094at so\nmuch a head.\"\n\nThey moved to the door, but the intense heat of the day for a moment\nseemed to dampen their ardor. Then, at Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s solicitations, Diana was\npersuaded to wait until he found out from an official the possible\nlength of their stop.\n\nWithin the Long Horn saloon the afternoon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heat was apparently not felt\nby its inmates.  It was a roughly hewn, wooden, three-cornered room with\nan oak beam stretching across it.  Over this were thrown saddles and\nblankets.  A bar extended along one side of the room.  On the walls were\ngrotesque and crude pictures done in chalk, while other spaces were\ncovered with cheap, highly colored illustrations cut from the papers\nthat reached Maverick.  Tables for roulette and faro were placed at set\nintervals.  The floor was covered with a mixture of sand and sawdust,\nwhile mounds of wood-dust were heaped near the bar, to be used by the\nmen as cuspidors.  It was clean in a certain primitive fashion.  The\nglasses and bar fixtures were not unpleasant.  The bartender, Nick, an\nex-prize-fighter, took a pride in his \"emporium,\" as he called the\nsaloon, and lavished a loving though crude care on his possessions.\n\nBut the place was stained and soiled by the marks of the tragic remnants\nof humanity that were housed within its walls.  Around the\ngambling-tables on this afternoon were groups of tattered specimens of\nthe various races.  Cow-boys at certain tables gave a wholesome, virile\nnote to the place, but the drift-wood of a broken civilization was at\nthis hour in larger proportion than the ranchmen.  Among the battered\ndenizens from the world beyond that had strayed into the saloon life was\na parson in a frayed frock-coat, who leaned in a neighborly way against\nthe blue shirt of a Chinaman, while a large negro with a face like a\nblack Botticelli angel grinned and gleamed his white teeth in sport with\na dago from Monterey. In a chair in a farther corner a tenderfoot lay in\na drunken sleep in his soiled evening clothes, which he had donned three\nnights before to prove to the tormenting habitu\u00c3\u00a9s of the place, who\nsince then had not allowed him to grow sober, that he was a gentleman.\n\nA half-breed at a faro-table watched with tolerant amusement the antics\nof those in his game to outwit him.  The smell of the sawdust and the\nhuman mass of unpleasantness grew stronger as the men played, changed\nmoney, and Nick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s corks flew and glasses clinked.  Over the entire place\nthere hung a curious sense of respectability.  Low-muttered oaths were\nnot uncommon, but Nick, sturdy and grim, with his watch-dogs\u00e2\u0080\u0094two large\nsix-shooters\u00e2\u0080\u0094lying on the shelf behind the bar, had a certain\nstraightness of purpose and a crude sense of right and wrong that won\nrespect from the heterogeneous mass of his followers.\n\nThe passing of the Limited would have caused a sufficient amount of\ninterest, but its stopping was a momentous occasion.  The rude platform\noutside was only a shipping-point for cattle, not a stopping-place for\nthrough or passenger trains.  There was a rush of some of the inmates\nfrom the room, but to a number of them the game was at its vital point,\nand Pete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lazy call of \"jacks up\" quickly chained the attention of the\nmore eager of the players.\n\nBut to Nick it meant new trade, and his battered and scarred face grew\ninto one ebullient smile as McSorley, the engineer, in his jumpers, with\nbegrimed face and hands, and Dan, the dapper Pullman conductor of the\nOverland Limited, entered the saloon. McSorley was mopping his sweating\nface.\n\n\"Say, Dan, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the English swells in the private?\" he asked, as he\nlooked back at the luxuriously fitted car.\n\n\"The Earl of Kerhill,\" Dan answered, as they veered towards the bar.\n\"Been out to the Yellowstone. The old man lets \u00e2\u0080\u0099em have his private car.\nMust be the real thing, eh?\"\n\nMcSorley grunted his approval of the noble freight that he was carrying.\n\"Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s have a drink.  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yours, Dan?\"\n\nThey reached the solicitous Nick.\n\n\"What \u00e2\u0080\u0099ll you have, gents?\"\n\n\"A bottle of beer for me, Mac,\" Dan answered his companion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s question.\nThen, with English tips still a pleasant memory, he added, \"But this is\non me.\"\n\nNick began opening a bottle of beer, and its foaming contents were soon\nfilling the glasses.  As he served he inquired: \"What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up gents?\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t often the Overland Limited honors Maverick with a call!\"\n\n\"Washout down the road,\" was McSorley\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laconic reply, as the cool\nliquid slid down his parched throat.\n\n\"Staying long?\" Nick again asked, with visions of many strangers\nvisiting his bar.\n\nDan was surveying the place with an unsympathetic eye.\n\n\"Not longer than we can help, you bet,\" he answered. \"Expecting orders\nto move every minute.\"\n\nBut Nick was determined to be affable.  \"Pity; Maverick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth seein\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\nWho\u00e2\u0080\u0099s in the parlor-car?\"\n\n\"English people\u00e2\u0080\u0094Earl of Kerhill and party,\" Dan replied.  Then he moved\ndown the bar with McSorley, both carrying their half-consumed beer.\n\nA Southern cow-puncher, Pete, who had gone from ranch to ranch, finding\nlife too hard at each, leaned back on his stool until he rested against\none end of the bar.  Through the windows he could see Shorty, one of Jim\nCarston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s men, coming along in animated conversation with several other\nmen of the Englishman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ranch.\n\n\"In my opinion the calm serenity of this here metropolis is about to be\ntore wide open.\"  A nudge from Punk, the Chinaman, made him go on with\nthe shuffling.\n\n\"How many, Parson?\" Pete queried.\n\nThe cadaverous face of the Parson, with its highly colored nose, showing\nthe cause of his cloth\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disgrace, turned to him.  Frayed and seedy as\nhe was, he bore the imprint of a gentleman.\n\n\"Dearly beloved brethren, three.\"\n\nAgain Punk nudged the others, who were inclined to become too talkative.\nThey began indicating the number of cards desired with their fingers\nwhile the conversation continued.  Nick leaned over the bar and watched\nPete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand.\n\n\"Cash Hawkins is in town!\"  Pete gave the news as though it were of\nmoment.  They all knew what Cash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s visits usually meant.  An ominous\nwhistle followed.  They all looked at Nick.\n\n\"Bad medicine is this same Mr. Hawkins, particular when he has his gun\nwid him.  Bedad, the kummunity could spare him a whole lot without\nmissing him,\" Nick volunteered.\n\n\"If they provoke unto wrath Brother Carston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outfit, my Christian\nfriend, there will be some useful citizens removed from our midst.\"  The\nParson approved of Jim as a remnant of his earlier days.  He recognized\nin him one of his own class.\n\n\"And who the devil is Jim Carston?\" Nick asked.\n\n\"Jim Carston?  Never seen Jim?  Oh yes, you must have, although Jim\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t frequent emporiums much.  Why Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the English cow-boy.  First he\nhad a place about a hundred miles from here.  But he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bought Bull\nCowan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s herd.  Bull stuck him\u00e2\u0080\u0094stuck him good,\" Pete lazily informed the\ncrowd.\n\n\"Sure!\" said Nick.  \"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why Englishmen was invented.  More power to\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099em.\"\n\n\"Amen,\" hiccoughed the Parson, whose drinks by this time had been\nnumerous.  \"The prosperity of our beloved country would go plumb to\nGehenna if an all-wise Providence did not enable us to sell an\nEnglishman a mine or a ranch or two now and again.\"\n\n\"Say,\" Nick asked, seriously, \"the Englishman ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a-goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 up agin\nCash, is he now?\"\n\n\"I call you, Parson,\" Pete calmly commanded, and then raked in the pot.\n\"When the smoke has cleared away I will venture an opinion as to who has\ngone agin who,\" he resumed, as he pocketed the money. \"Jim and his\noutfit is here to ship some cattle to Chicago.  I seed them all through\nthe window, and they ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the kind to run away much.\"\n\nThere was a finality about Pete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words.  He might be lazy and slow, but\nhe was anxious to open another pot, so he turned his back on Nick and\nbegan shuffling the cards.  As he did so, three of Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boys\u00e2\u0080\u0094Andy,\nShorty, and Grouchy\u00e2\u0080\u0094entered.\n\n\"Come on boys and have a drink,\" Shorty yelled.\n\nAndy was a wiry, slender German with tender, romantic proclivities.\nGrouchy, who seldom spoke, and then only in a husky, low growl, was a\nmassive fellow and looked like a Samoan native, but was in reality a\nproduct of a Hebrew father and an Irish mother, while Shorty gained his\nname from his low stature.  Brave as a lion and honest, with a face from\nwhich twinkled the smallest and merriest of blue eyes, he was the live\nwire of any ranch.\n\n\"What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your nose-paint, gents?\" Nick asked, as he greeted the\nnew-comers.\n\n\"A little of that redeye,\" Shorty replied, and soon he and his comrades\nwere clinking glasses.  Several cow-punchers joined them, and the place\nbegan to resound to lively disputes concerning the rates on cattle.\n\nDan and McSorley had finished their beer.\n\n\"How much?\" Dan said.  His look plainly showed his contempt for the\nsaloon.  It was Nick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opportunity to pay back the insult that had been\nquietly levelled at him by the Pullman conductor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attitude for the past\nquarter of an hour.\n\n\"One dollar,\" was Nick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quick reply.\n\n\"One dollar!\" Dan repeated.  \"For two glasses of beer?\"  He stepped back\nand his voice rose in angry protest.  It attracted the attention of the\nothers, who were only too eager for a row.\n\n\"Why,\" Dan continued, \"it was all collar, anyway.\"\n\nNick leaned over the bar and quietly said, \"I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t charge nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for\nthe collar, gent, I throwed that in.\"  There was a laugh from the\nhangers-on at Nick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s witticism.  Nick flushed with approval and went on,\n\"Beer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our most expensive drink\u00e2\u0080\u0094comes all the way from Cheyenne.\"\n\nDan, furious at being done, as he knew he was, struck the bar with his\nfist.  \"I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay it,\" he said.\n\nThere was a hush about the room.  They didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t often see any one venture\nto buck against Nick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s authority.\n\n\"Oh yes, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll pay it, gent.\"  Nick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice was lower and calmer than\nDan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  He had turned while Dan was speaking and was lovingly fingering\nhis six-shooter.  He lifted it from the shelf and laid it carefully on\nthe bar, keeping his hand well over the trigger.\n\nMcSorley nervously edged to Dan.  \"Better pay it; better pay it,\" he\nwhispered.\n\nNick heard him.  \"Yes,\" he added, \"better pay it.  Saves funeral\nexpenses.\"\n\nDan knew enough of the country to know he was at Nick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mercy.  He drew\na silver dollar from his pocket, and slapped it down on the bar.\n\n\"Well, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be \u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094!\"  Dan started for the door, followed by McSorley, who\nthought his companion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rage ill-timed.  He wished he were back in his\ncaboose. As they reached the door Nick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice rang out in stentorian\ntones.\n\n\"Wait a minute!\"  There was no gainsaying his command.  Dan halted.\nNick, leaning far over the bar, held in each hand a watch-dog.  \"I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nallow no tenderfoot to use bad language in my emporium. We do strictly\nfamily trade and caters particular to ladies and children.\"\n\nDan and McSorley stood under the levelled guns. A shriek of mirth shook\nthe crowd.  All had stopped playing and were watching the situation.\nFinally, when there was no doubt as to the ridiculous position of the\ntrain officials and the laugh had subsided, Nick dropped the guns, and\nwith a low bow turned from the bar, leaving them free to go.  Dan and\nMcSorley quickly disappeared, Dan wildly expostulating while McSorley\nvainly tried to calm him.\n\nNick went back to the players.\n\n\"Pete,\" he asked, \"what has Cash got agin the Englishman?\"\n\nPete, nothing loath to tell his yarn, especially as he had been winning\nall the afternoon, drawled the information so that all at his table\ncould hear.\n\n\"Well, Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s outfit has been heard to openly express the opinion that\nCash can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t tell the difference between his cattle and Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\"\n\n\"Rustling, eh?\" the Parson interrupted.\n\nPete nodded.\n\n\"Serious business.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Pete.  \"Serious\u00e2\u0080\u0094quite\u00e2\u0080\u0094in these here parts.  I see the\nEnglishman stand off a greaser down at the agency, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got a wad of\nthe long-green to lay even money that Cash can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t twist the British\nlion\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tail a whole lot\u00e2\u0080\u0094not a whole lot.  Any takers?\"\n\nPete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eye was always keen to take up a \"sure thing.\"  The men with him\nfell into a dispute concerning the respective merits of Jim versus Cash\nHawkins.\n\nMeanwhile, seated at a table in the centre of the room were Shorty,\nAndy, and Grouchy.  They had heard nothing of Pete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and the Parson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nconversation. They were intent on a mild game and were awaiting Big\nBill, who was to meet them at the saloon.  None of them saw Big Bill\ncoming towards them until they heard the slow, deep voice saying: \"Boys,\nCash Hawkins is in town.  The boss asks as a special favor to him that\nyou will avoid Cash and his gang and try to get out of town without a\ncollision.\"\n\nBill was a giant, over six feet tall, with a great, leonine head.  He\nhad a strong face with piercing eyes. The mouth, \"a large gash,\" as\nShorty described it, could at times give vent to loud guffaws of\nlaughter, and at others frighten one as it straightened into two lines\nof grim determination.  For two years he had been Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right-hand man,\nand his devotion to the boss was the most beautiful side of Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life.\nForty years ago he had been born in a prairie saloon; the woman who bore\nhim died the night of his birth.  He never knew who his father was, and\nthe upbringing he received was from a handful of miners who had adopted\nhim.  As soon as he could toddle he began to try to do for himself.\nLittle errands he volunteered, and long before most boys even on a ranch\nwere anything but a nuisance, Bill was contributing gravely his share to\nthe big game of life.  Save once, to Jim, he never spoke of the past.\nHe had drifted to Maverick twenty years ago, and except at intervals,\nwhen he took a notion to better himself, he was usually at the cow town.\n\nOn one of these occasions when he was trailing the country he met Jim,\nwho was looking for a man to direct the practical side of his affairs.\nBill had never met a gentleman who treated him as Jim did, and in return\nhe gave his body\u00e2\u0080\u0099s strength and all the scheming devotion of his brain\nin his endeavor to benefit Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s complicated affairs.\n\nThe three men looked up at Bill, who slid into a chair at their table\nand started a new game with them.\n\n\"Say, Bill,\" Shorty began, \"if Cash has his war-paint on there ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t no\nuse distributin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tracts on love one another.\"\n\n\"Und, Bill,\" Andy added, \"und say for peace\u00e2\u0080\u0094dot\u00e2\u0080\u0099s me, Andy.  But say,\nBill, rustlin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094cattle stealing\u00e2\u0080\u0094you know.  Particular when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s our\ncattle, Cash has got a lot wit\u00e2\u0080\u0099 a circle-star brand which original is a\nbig C for Carston.  Say,\" he wildly went on, becoming more incoherent as\nhis temper rose, \"und if we stand for it\u00e2\u0080\u0094you know\u00e2\u0080\u0094und say\u00e2\u0080\u0094we got to git\nout of de business.\"\n\nGrouchy leaned over to Bill and shook his head. \"Say, I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work\nfor a man that would stand for it.\"\n\nStill Bill said nothing, but listened gravely to the storm of protests\nthat the message from Jim to the boys had provoked.\n\n\"If the peace of a kummunity is worth a damn, you got to shoot him up a\nwhole lot.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this delicate consideration for the finer feelings of\nbad men which encourages \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.\"  Shorty, in his nervous, jerky manner,\nfairly shook the table with his vibrations of rebellion.\n\nThen Bill spoke.  He was in sympathy with the boys, but he had his\norders from the boss\u00e2\u0080\u0094that was enough for him.\n\n\"Well, you know Jim.  It ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t likely he\u00e2\u0080\u0099d ask you to show the\nwhite-feather nor to stand no nonsense.  Only\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094here Bill paused and\nsaid, impressively, \"don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drink mor\u00e2\u0080\u0099n you can help, and avoid trouble\nif possible.  Them\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the boss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders.\"\n\nAs Bill was laying down the law for the men, the saloon began to fill\nwith curiosity-seekers from the train.  The delay was evidently to be\nlonger than had at first been anticipated.  Shorty was the first to see\nthe humor of some of the new-comers.\n\n\"Gee, get on to the effete East.  Say,\" he called to the rest of them,\n\"get on to the tenderfeet.\"\n\nThey looked with childish glee at a quaint-looking couple who were\nentering the saloon.  Mrs. Doolittle was a prim, mild-mannered little\nwoman with a saintly smile.  She evidently was travelling in the West\nfor the first time.  Her husband, Hiram, was one of the prosperous New\nEngland farmer class.  Pleased with the entire condition of affairs, he\nbeamed on the cow-boys with great condescension.\n\nShorty, who scented some fun, whispered to Bill: \"D.C. brand.  Day\nCoach, savvy?\"  As he watched the odd pair he made his way towards them.\nThey were quietly studying the place.  The pictures of prize-fighters\nand ballet-girls that lined the walls really shocked them, but it also\ntickled their sense of the wickedness of their adventure.  They reached\na roulette-table with the game in progress.\n\n\"Why, Hiram!\" Mrs. Doolittle ejaculated, as she watched the players and\nsurveyed the saloon, \"this is a gambling-hell.\"\n\nShorty, who with the others was closely watching the strange adventurers\nand planning to tease them, mocked them in an aside\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"Well, I want to\nknow.\"\n\nBut Hiram was too intent on Faith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s observations to notice that they\nwere becoming the centre of interest in the place.\n\n\"Durned if it ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\" he affirmed, in a pleased tone. Then, ashamed of\nhis laxity, he added, \"Want to git out?\"\n\n\"Why, Hiram, what a question!\" Faith Doolittle answered, severely, as\nshe drew away from her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out-stretched hand.  \"\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t often one\ngets a chance to see life.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read about Montey Carlo, and here it\nis.\"\n\nThe boys were now all attention.  Andy whispered, \"Three card, eh;\nMontey Carlo here, eh!\"  The laugh began to be noticed by Hiram.\n\n\"Dear me,\" Faith Doolittle gravely remarked, \"and over there is\nrouletty, I suppose.\"\n\nShorty came forward.  He took off his large sombrero and bowed low to\nthe ground, in mock cavalier fashion as he good-humoredly said, \"No\nlady, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re voting for the most popular lady in the\nSabbath-school.\"  His sally was greeted with applause.  Faith hardly\nnoticed it; she had taken Hiram by the arm and was trying to drag him to\nthe table.\n\nPete called to them, \"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not rouletty, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faro, lady.\"\n\nThe parson added, \"So called after Pharaoh\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daughter.\"\n\n\"Who found a little prophet in the rushes on the bank,\" Shorty further\nexplained.\n\nBut Faith was eagerly whispering to Hiram, \"You know, Hiram, frequently\npeople by just putting down fifty cents, or a dollar, walk out with\nmillions.\"  Then timidly she added, \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to try it once.\"\n\n\"Faith Doolittle!\" was all Hiram could exclaim, so great was his\nsurprise at his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request.  Truly, he thought, women were strange\ncattle.  To think of Faith, so quiet, so serene all these years, and\nthen\u00e2\u0080\u0094to see her now with flushed cheeks, hat awry, and an eager,\nfeverish look in her mild eyes as she tried to draw him to the table.\n\n\"Oh,\" she pleaded, \"only fifty cents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth, Hiram. There couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be\nany harm in fifty cents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth.\"\n\nBehind his great hand Shorty convulsed the others by observing,\n\"Mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a sport, but father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s near.\"\n\nHiram now realized that he must be firm and leave this place that was\naffecting so strangely his wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conduct.\n\n\"You couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keep money got in that nefarious way, even if you won it,\"\nhe explained; \"you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a churchwoman.\"\n\n\"We could give some of it to the church,\" quickly reasoned Faith; \"and,\nHiram, we could do such a lot of good with a million.  Just try fifty\ncents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 worth.\"  She made a further attempt to reach the table.\n\n\"Come out of here, Faith Doolittle,\" stormed Hiram, as he saw his\nprotests were of no avail, \"or you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have me going it in a minute.\"\nHe, too, began to feel the tempting influence of the green cloth, the\nglittering money-heaps, and the feverish gayety of the ribald crowd.\n\nAs Hiram started to lead Faith to the door they were stopped by Shorty.\n\n\"Nick,\" he called to the bartender, \"my friends, Mr. and Mrs.\nHill\u00e2\u0080\u0094Bunkco Hill\u00e2\u0080\u0094of Boston.\"  The slang name for the innocence of the\ncouple caught the crowd\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fancy.  They quickly formed a circle around\nthem.\n\n\"Pleased to know you,\" Nick observed from the bar.  \"What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s your drink?\"\nHe began filling glasses with whiskey.\n\nThis time Hiram\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indignation was effectual.  Grasping his\nnow-frightened spouse by the arm, he fiercely drew her away, the\ncow-boys laughingly letting them go, with polite bows, and bits of\nadvice called good-naturedly after them.\n\nIt was the sport of children, as indeed these men were to a great\nextent\u00e2\u0080\u0094crude, rough, but with a sweetness not to be denied and a decency\nthat it might seem strange to find in such a place.  So far their fun\nmight go, but they knew where to stop, and Faith Doolittle\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gentle face\nwas its own protection.  They watched Hiram nervously leading his wife\nalong the platform down the line.  Then they turned back to the saloon\nand amused themselves by giving imitations of the quaint visitors, until\nthe place rang with their boisterous merriment.\n\nSuddenly there was a rattle of spurs and a noise from without as a tall\ncow-puncher lurched through the door.\n\nIn a moment there was silence.  Every one knew the man.\n\n\"Hello, here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cash now,\" observed Shorty.\n\nThe innocent gayety was forgotten.  A different expression began to\nappear on the men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faces.  In Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s crowd it was one of sullen\nrebellion and suppressed indignation, in the other an expectant desire\nfor real mischief.  With Cash Hawkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s entrance that afternoon, history\nwas made in Maverick.\n\n\n\n\n                              *CHAPTER XV*\n\n\nCash Hawkins leaned against the bar and maliciously took in the silence\nthat followed his entrance into the saloon.  He knew he was feared; he\nhad made more than one man there feel his power. Malignity was marked in\nhis demeanor and in the physiognomy of his face.  He was lithe and\nstraight, with wiry, steel-like muscles.  He had a small head with a\nshock of tawny hair that he wore much longer than is usual with\nranchmen.  The rawhide strap of his hat hung under his chin, and his\nface, with its long, pointed wolf jaw, suggested that animal in its\nexpression of ferocious keenness.  When he grew excited his mouth moved\nconvulsively, like an ugly trap ready to devour its prey.  His hands\nwere curiously beautiful\u00e2\u0080\u0094long and slender, with almond-shaped nails.\nThe care he bestowed on them to keep their beauty in the midst of his\nrough life, the gorgeousness of his leather chaps with their mounting of\nsilver, and the embroidery on his waistcoat betrayed his salient\nweakness\u00e2\u0080\u0094inordinate vanity.  He was handsome in a cruel, hard fashion.\nOf his power as an athlete there was no question.  In the saloon many\ncould testify to the devilish cunning of those supple hands.\n\n\"Got a bottle of ink handy, Nick?\" he said, when he had insolently\nsurveyed the assemblage, who, after a pause, were beginning to talk and\nsettle down to new games.\n\nNick, who wished to be friendly with all who patronized him, answered:\n\n\"Ink?  Ink is a powerful depressing drink, Cash.\"\n\n\"Drink!\"  Cash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face grew livid with rage.  \"You see here, Nick, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nyou joke with me; I ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the humor for it.  People has to know me\nintimate to joke with me\u00e2\u0080\u0094savvy?  You get me a pen and a bottle of ink\nP.D.Q.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m buying some cattle of Tabywana, the Ute chief\u00e2\u0080\u0094savvy?  And\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got to put his mark to the contract.\"\n\nWith swaggering gestures Cash announced his business so that all could\nhear him.  Bill whispered to the boys, who, going on with their game,\nwere still listening and watching Cash intently:\n\n\"You know what that skunk\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to now.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got Tabywana drunk\u00e2\u0080\u0094been at\nit for days\u00e2\u0080\u0094in order to swindle him out of his cattle.\"\n\nShorty, with all of the cow-boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intolerance of the red man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights,\nsnapped, \"Well, it don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make much difference about Injins.\"\n\n\"No,\" growled Grouchy, \"guv\u00e2\u0080\u0099ment supports \u00e2\u0080\u0099em anyway.\"\n\nNick had unearthed a bottle of ink.\n\n\"Well,\" he said, as he handed it across the bar, \"that was ink once,\nCash.  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had no use for it sense my gal throwed me.  Gits more\npeople into trouble.  Often wisht I was illiterate.\"  Nick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dry humor\nbetrayed his descent from the Emerald Isle.\n\nCash paid no attention to Nick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attempts at conversation.  He was\nfilling his glass and surveying the crowds at the various tables.  It\nannoyed him that no one had greeted him with any particular show of\nenthusiasm.  Save for a \"How d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye,\" or a nod from some of the\nhangers-on, no one had particularly noticed him.  He stood against the\nbar, and without turning his body directed his words towards Big Bill\nand Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s men at a table near him.  With a truculent swagger he blew his\ncigarette smoke through his nostrils.\n\n\"There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s just one thing I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand for,\" he began, \"and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an\nEnglishman.\"  There was a movement from Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s men, but it was quickly\ncontrolled.  Cash went on: \"He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a blot on any landscape, and wherever I\nsee him I shall wipe him off the map.  He is distinctly no good.  We\nwhipped \u00e2\u0080\u0099em once, and we kin do it again.  They \u00e2\u0080\u0099ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t never whipped\nnuthin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 but niggers and savages.  The Englishman is a coward and any\nAmerican who works for him is a cur.\"\n\nWith one movement Andy, Shorty, and Grouchy rose and their hands went to\ntheir guns, but almost before they had clutched them Bill was towering\nover them.  With one hand he pushed Grouchy, and with the other gripped\nthe shoulders of Shorty and Andy, until he forced them down into their\nchairs.\n\n\"Leave him to me,\" was all he said, and the men sullenly subsided under\ntheir foreman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders.\n\nBill stood looking at Cash.  He wanted to gain time and not take any\nnotice of insults from him until it was so directly levelled that they\ncould no longer endure it.  He wished Jim would come; it was time for\nhim.  He wanted to finish some details of the shipping and then get\ntheir men to leave Maverick.\n\nCash saw Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s command of the men; he ground his jaw with ugly grating\nsounds from his big white teeth.  Looking directly at Bill, he said,\n\"There is a certain outfit been a circilatin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 reports derogitory to my\nstandin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in this here kummunity, and before the day is over I will round\nup said outfit and put my brand on \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.\"  As he spoke he touched his\ngun.\n\n\"Same as you been a-puttin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 it on their cattle?\" Bill remarked, coldly.\n\nThis was what Cash wanted; but he saw Tabywana coming along the\nplatform, and there was too much at stake to allow him to gratify his\nfeeling of anger against Bill then.  He gave a low, chuckling laugh.\n\n\"A remark I overlook for the time bein\u00e2\u0080\u0099, as I ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to take\nadvantage of the absence of the furrin gent that owns you.\"\n\nHe came towards Tabywana, who, halting and stumbling, was trying to\ncross the room.  Cash laughed malevolently as he noticed his helpless\ncondition.  The Indian was trailing his blanket along the ground, his\nfeathers were broken, and all intelligence\u00e2\u0080\u0094even cunning\u00e2\u0080\u0094was blotted from\nhis face. The unconquerable dignity of a fallen aristocrat alone\nremained, and even handicapped as he was by his inebriated condition, he\nstood out against the others in the saloon as the one true claimant of\nAmerica\u00e2\u0080\u0099s royal race.\n\n[Illustration: \"ALMOST AS ONE MAN THEY THRUST THEIR REVOLVERS INTO BUD\u00e2\u0080\u0099S\nFACE\" See page 200]\n\nCash caught him by the arm and steered him to the bar.  \"Hello, Chief,\"\nhe began, most affably; \"come over here and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll close our trade in a\njiffy.\"\n\nHe spoke lightly, but his mouth began its rapacious twitching\u00e2\u0080\u0094Cash was\nreally a little nervous over the deal.  The government once in a while\nremembered its people, and took up the claim of the red man. He drew\nfrom his belt a paper.\n\n\"Ther\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the big treaty, Chief,\" he hurriedly began to explain.  \"Now all\nyou got to do is to make your mark to it.\"  He spoke aloud so that all\ncould hear as he said, \"Heap good trade.\"  Cash was clever enough to\nknow that if the deal took place in the saloon in the presence of Nick\nit would seem, if inquiry were made later, a fair deal.\n\nBut Tabywana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind had been tortured by one desire\u00e2\u0080\u0094more drink from the\nbottle that the white man controlled.\n\nHe mumbled helplessly as he leaned against the bar and began soliciting\nNick for a drink.\n\n\"What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to trade?\" Cash burst forth.  \"Why, damn\nyou\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"  Then he paused; to lose his temper would accomplish nothing.  A\nlittle patience and he could force Tabywana to make his mark.  He\nglanced about the saloon.  The others were paying little attention to\nhim\u00e2\u0080\u0094a drunken Indian was of no moment to them.  He signalled Nick that\nhe would take the responsibility of giving the Indian liquor.  Both knew\nit was against the law, but both also knew that it was a law daily\nbroken.\n\n\"Touge-wayno fire-water,\" wailed Tabywana.\n\nCash took hold of him.  \"What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the matter, you\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nTabywana turned to him.  Yes, for days this Cash Hawkins had given him\nhis drink; why shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he do so now?  Nick was watching them from over\nhis shoulder as he took down a bottle of rye. Tabywana pointed to him.\n\n\"No give \u00e2\u0080\u0099em, me\u00e2\u0080\u0094heap like \u00e2\u0080\u0099em\u00e2\u0080\u0094big medicine, sick.  Me all time heap\nsick.\"  By his gestures he indicated that his body was suffering for the\nmedicine. \"Wayno medicine,\" he continued.  \"Pretty soon, more\nfire-water, catch \u00e2\u0080\u0099em.  Pretty soon\u00e2\u0080\u0094maybe so\u00e2\u0080\u0094no sick.\"  Incoherently he\ntried to explain that the drink would cure him at once.  If not, then\npretty soon he would be very ill.\n\nEven at a moment like this Nick could not resist the temptation to tease\nthe Chief.  He poured out some whiskey, Tabywana tried to reach it, but\nNick lifted the glass and drank it.  The sight of it maddened Tabywana:\nwith his two fists he struck the bar and gave vent to his rage in a loud\nvoice.\n\nCash saw it was time to finish the business.  He put his arm about\nTabywana, while he directed Nick to give the Indian the bottle.\n\n\"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agin the law to give you whiskey, Chief. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Tain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t every one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got\nthe nerve to treat you like a white man.\"  By this time he was holding\nthe bottle high up in the air.  \"But there ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t no one hereabouts goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nto question any trade I make.  Every man has an inalienable right\u00e2\u0080\u0094say,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099inalienable\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0099 great, Chief\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good medicine,\" he\ntranslated\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"inalienable right to git drunk if he wants to, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nagoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to protect you in your rights.\"\n\nHe held the paper close to Tabywana; he lowered his voice.\n\n\"Now just put your mark to that paper and you get this bottleful and the\ntime of your life.\"  The words were accompanied with explanatory\ngestures so that Tabywana could understand.\n\nThe Indian tried to reach the bottle.  Then he saw the paper; he took\nhold of the pen and bent over it. As he did so a girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s figure slid in\nbetween him and Cash, and the bottle went smashing out of Cash Hawkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nhand up against the bottles and glasses on the shelf at the back of the\nbar.  There was a crash of breaking glass and a snarling curse from\nHawkins.\n\nTabywana stood dazed for a moment at the sight of Nat-u-ritch, who\nsilently faced him and Hawkins. He made a sweeping gesture of fury, and\nattempted to strike Nat-u-ritch, but she cleverly dodged him. The force\nof the unarrested blow carried Tabywana against a table, he stumbled\ninto a chair, made an attempt to rise, but, after a desperate effort,\nfell back in a drunken stupor, oblivious to his surroundings. The sudden\nburst of anger was the natural climax to days of dissipation.\n\nThe crash of the glasses and the sudden entrance of the girl attracted\nthe attention of the gamblers.  Some of them, scenting a fracas, stopped\nplaying; others merely looked up, and then went on with the game. What\ndid an Indian, male or female, matter to them?\n\nCash propped himself up against the bar.  For the first time he really\nwas brought within close range of Nat-u-ritch.  Silent and immovable she\nstood, guarding the sunken form of her father.  Her head was erect and\nshe looked her contempt and scorn full in Hawkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.  In her hands\nshe held the fallen blanket of her father.\n\n\"Well, what d\u00e2\u0080\u0099ye think of it, eh?\" Cash finally ejaculated.  His eyes\ntook note of the girl\u00e2\u0080\u0099s physical perfection.  \"Say, fer spunk and grit\ndam\u00e2\u0080\u0099f I ever see her equal.  Say, she can have me, kin Tabywana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsquaw.\"\n\nNick interposed sullenly as he straightened up the disordered bar.\n\n\"She ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t Tabywana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s squaw\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Nat-u-ritch, his gal\u00e2\u0080\u0094his daughter.\"\n\n\"Daughter or squaw, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t make no difference to me.\"  Cash slouched up\nto Nat-u-ritch and insolently surveyed her.  \"She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s puty, she is, and\nI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll include her in the deal.  Say, sis, I like your looks.  You please\nme a whole lot, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll buy you along with your father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cattle\u00e2\u0080\u0094savvy?\"\n\nStill she made no answer\u00e2\u0080\u0094she knew what the white man was suggesting.\nThat she had accomplished what she had dared to save her father now\nfrightened her.  She wanted to get him away and escape with him.  But\nhow?  She could not leave him.  She only clutched the blanket tighter.\n\nCash caught sight of the half-breed Baco, who was often called in to act\nas interpreter by the white men. \"Baco,\" he called, \"what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s her name\nmean?\"  He designated Nat-u-ritch with his thumb.\n\nBaco grinned: \"Purty little gal.\"  He had cast his own eyes\nunsuccessfully on Nat-u-ritch.\n\n\"Well, she lives up to the name all right.  Ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t she hell?\"  Cash\ndrooped lower against the bar.  \"Say, Nat-u-ritch, you take chances with\nme when you interfere that way like you did jest now.\"\n\nAlong the platform Jim swung, the gray dust whitening his leather chaps\nand dusting his shirt and hat with a heavy powder.  He had ridden hard\nto keep his appointment with Bill and his men.  As he entered the centre\ndoor of the saloon he watched Hawkins and the little Indian girl with\ncuriosity. He took in the situation at a glance.  The drunken Chief, the\ntigerish Hawkins bending over the girl like an animal about to crunch a\newe lamb, and the contents of the smashed bottle that Nick was wiping\naway told him what had occurred.  Cash was saying:\n\n\"Nat-u-ritch, you spoiled a very puty deal, and I ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t complaisant a\nwhole lot with people as do that, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to pass that up, \u00e2\u0080\u0099cause\nyou please me, and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to annex you.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re comin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to my\nwickyup\u00e2\u0080\u0094savvy?  And to seal the bargain, and to show you that I ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nproud like the ordinary white man, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to give you a kiss.\"\n\nBefore Hawkins could catch the resisting girl in his arms, Jim quietly\nstepped between them.\n\n\"Drop that, Hawkins.\"  The voice of the Englishman was electrical.\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s men jumped to their feet. At a move of Cash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand to his belt\nthey grasped their guns.  \"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pull your gun, Cash,\" Jim said. \"You\nwant to get your gang together before you do that.  My boys would shoot\nyou into ribbons.\"  Jim was smoking a long cigar.  He coolly took it\nfrom his lips, knocked off the ashes, then bent over Nat-u-ritch and\nwhispered to her.  Her eyes alone answered him. He was about to join his\nmen when Cash Hawkins swaggered up to him.\n\n\"Say, son, ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you courtin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 disaster interferin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in my private\nbusiness?\" he threatened.  He knew he dare not fight alone against Jim\nand his men, so he played for time.  If only he had his gang!\n\nJim replied: \"Do you call it \u00e2\u0080\u0099business\u00e2\u0080\u0099 robbing Indians when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\ndrunk, and insulting women?\"\n\nThe cow-boy honor\u00e2\u0080\u0094for Cash had a crude drilling in the laws of the\nWest\u00e2\u0080\u0094flamed at the last words, and in all sincerity, true to his\nAmerican point of view, he answered, hotly:\n\n\"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you accuse me of insultin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 women.  She ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0094she\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a\nsquaw.\"\n\nJim turned away.  Why argue?\n\n\"Bill,\" he said, \"you and Grouchy put Tabywana on his pony.\nNat-u-ritch, pike way, and take your father with you.\"  He knew she\ncould manage the ponies and arrive at her wickyup in safety; in fact,\nthe pony would take the Chief home as he would a dead weight, if\nTabywana was once strapped on his back.\n\nThe men struggled with the heavy body of Tabywana, and they finally\nsucceeded in dragging him across the room, followed by Nat-u-ritch\ncarrying the blanket.  Cash could only watch\u00e2\u0080\u0094he was helpless\u00e2\u0080\u0094so he\nsnarled:\n\n\"You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve spoiled my trade, eh?\"\n\nJim turned to him.  \"The bar is closed to Indians in Maverick.\"  He\nmeant Cash to infer that he could make it unpleasant for him if he\ncalled the government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention to the matter.\n\nBut Cash only sneeringly asked, \"By whose orders?\"\n\n\"Uncle Sam\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders, and they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re backed up by the big \u00e2\u0080\u0099C\u00e2\u0080\u0099 brand.\"\n\nAt these words Shorty and Andy both pulled their guns, and stood ready\nto defend Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statement. Cash gave a loud shout, then threw himself\nagainst the bar as he screamed to attract the people in the room.\n\n\"Gents,\" he called, \"the Young Men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Christian Association is in the\nsaddle.  Say,\" he wildly went on, \"it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to be perfectly sweet in\nMaverick.  Nick,\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094he turned to the bartender, who now wished that\nHawkins would go\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be back for a glass of lemonade.\"  Then he came\nto Jim, and, bowing low, he said, with all the venom and malice of his\nnature, \"And say, angel-face, when I come back you better be prepared to\nlead in prayer.\"\n\nHe made a lunge at Jim, but the sharp eyes of his men never left his\nhands.  Cash gave a wild roar of derisive laughter, flung himself across\nthe room, turned at the door, pointed to Jim, again laughed wildly, and\nthen disappeared.  Shorty and Andy followed him to the door.  Jim,\nindifferent, with his back to him, walked to a table at the farther end\nof the room.\n\nThe place was silent now.  Jim knew he had received a direct challenge.\nAccording to the laws of the West, Cash was entitled to get his men\ntogether to meet Jim and his men.  Every one in the saloon was on the\nalert.  The Englishman was not well known there, but from what they had\nheard they knew he was courageous.  Would he prove it now?  If so, it\nmeant that he would be there when Cash returned. Shorty turned from the\ndoor.\n\n\"He\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be back,\" he said, without looking at Jim.\n\nJim went on smoking.  \"Of course,\" he answered. He deliberately seated\nhimself at the table and began shuffling the cards.\n\nThen Shorty and the crowd knew that he meant to see the thing through.\nIt was a quiet way, but, they all agreed, a good way of accepting it.\nShorty exchanged glances with Andy.  The boss was of the right sort.  A\nlittle more dash would have pleased them better, still\u00e2\u0080\u0094\n\n\"Und say,\" Andy said, \"und with his gang.\"  He didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want the boss to\nmake too light of the proposition.\n\nBut Shorty, who now was sure of Jim, answered for him, \"So much the\nbetter, eh?  We can clean \u00e2\u0080\u0099em all up together.  Say, boss, what did you\nlet him make it a matter of Injins fer?  You got the sentiment of the\nkummunity agin you right from the start.  Looks like fightin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for\ntrifles.\"\n\nGrouchy, who had the news from Andy, who was now explaining it to Bill,\nstraddled into a chair as he said, \"Yes, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s some dignified to fight\nover cattle, but Injins\u00e2\u0080\u0094pshaw!\"\n\nJim knew it was useless to try to explain.  Their opinions on these\nmatters were as separate as the poles; but they were a good sort, and\nserved him well and faithfully.  Personally he did not care for this\nproposed fight with Hawkins.  He wanted peace\u00e2\u0080\u0094some days when he might\ndream and drift and watch the sand plains, when the work was done.  The\nbroils of the saloons, the point of view of the crowd, the honor of the\nWest really mattered little to him, but for the sake of the boys, and\nthat their pride in him might not suffer, he often accepted their\ndefinition of the code of life that was followed in Maverick.  He knew\nhow to win them, so he began:\n\n\"Well, boys, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to drag you into my quarrel.  If you feel that\nway about Indians\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"  He was about to add that he did not, but Shorty\ninterrupted:\n\n\"Pull up, boss; \u00e2\u0080\u0099tain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair to make us look as if we were trying to\nsneak out of a scrap.  It was only the cause of it.  You ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got a\nquitter in your gang, and you know it.\"\n\n\"I know it, Shorty.\"  Jim was obliged to laugh at the eager faces of the\nthree men who stood close to him, like excited children waiting to be\nunderstood.\n\n\"Well, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say anything more about it, will you? Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"  Shorty put\nout his hand.\n\nJim grasped it.  \"Let it go at that,\" Jim finished. \"You understand that\nyou are to leave Cash to me unless more get into the game.\"\n\nBill, who had been listening to it all, drew Jim aside. He preferred\npeace, but knew that they and Carston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ranch stood marked for the crowd\nto jeer at for all time unless they did what was expected of them by the\nlaws of the cow town, made by its men, not by the government that they\nabused.\n\n\"Jim\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094Bill spoke over his shoulder\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"Bud Hardy, the County Sheriff, is\nstanding just behind you at the bar, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s particular thick with\nCash. Got to take him into account.\"\n\nJim nodded; with his arm through Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s he crossed to a side entrance\nand stood under the porch.  He wanted to discuss with Bill what was best\nto do. Shorty and Andy stood up against the bar and treated their\nparticular friends to drinks.  They felt it was going to be a red-letter\nday for Carston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ranch.\n\nOutside the Overland Limited tooted at intervals, and sent up shrill\nwhistles, but made no attempt to leave Maverick.  One official\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ninformation was denied by the next one.  Passengers had come in and had\ngone again\u00e2\u0080\u0094some of them frightened, some disgusted by the life of the\nsaloon.  A little farther down the line others of the passengers were\nbeing amused by some Indians who, at the news of the train\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stopping,\nhad hurried to the railroad.\n\nCash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure had allowed the place to grow quiet.  Even Nick hoped\nhe would not find his men and return.  There was a sudden shunting of\nthe train, and the rear car moved back in to more direct view of the\nsaloon.  Diana, tired of the wait, had finally persuaded Sir John and\nHenry to alight and see the place.  They all entered together.\n\n\"By Jove, what a rum hole!\" Sir John exclaimed.\n\n\"Hello, there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a faro-table!\" exclaimed Henry.\n\nAll that Diana said was, \"I thought you had given up play, Henry.\"\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\"Of course, my dear, but a little sport to kill the tedium of this\ninfernal wait\u00e2\u0080\u0094the monotony of the thing is getting on my nerves.  John,\nwill you look after Di while I at least watch the game?\"\n\n\"Delighted,\" Sir John replied, but his anxious face showed that he\nthoroughly disapproved of the proceedings.  \"Really, Diana,\" he began,\n\"let me prevail upon you to leave here.  Any one who remains in a place\nof this kind is taking chances\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh, believe me\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\"Nonsense; it all looks deadly dull to me.\"\n\nThe men, recognizing a quietly gowned gentle-woman, paid no attention to\nthem.\n\n\"Why, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not afraid, John.  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s liable to happen?\"\n\nSir John Applegate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind was filled with stories of the West he had\nheard and read in his boyhood days.\n\n\"Why, these desperadoes are liable to come in here and request you to\ndance\u00e2\u0080\u0094dance for their amusement, by Jove!\"\n\n\"Well, what of that?  We don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it,\" Diana teasingly interrupted.\n\n\"Oh yes, my dear Diana, we _do_ do it.  The request is an order, you\nknow\u00e2\u0080\u0094obligatory\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh, quite? Because, believe me, if we do not accede to\ntheir absurd request, they playfully shoot your toes off, by Jove!  They\nare shockingly rude, by Jove! these chaps, believe me\u00e2\u0080\u0094oh, shockingly!\"\n\nDiana looked about the room.\n\n\"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve read of such things, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe they happen\u00e2\u0080\u0094do you?\"\n\nHenry was lost to them in the crowd around the faro-table.  Several\nother passengers from the train had joined him.  Sir John really did not\nlike the look of the place; at the moment he caught Pete\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes fastened\nin amusement on him.  He drew Diana to one corner, and as he did so they\ncame within range of Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sight.  He was coming in to join Shorty and\nexplain what he and Bill had decided to do when Cash returned.  As he\nsaw Diana he involuntarily drew back.  It was only one of the old\ntormenting visions that had returned, he thought.  He drew his hands\nover his eyes\u00e2\u0080\u0094but no, he saw her again!  Impossible! He leaned\nforward\u00e2\u0080\u0094it was Di, and in Maverick!  In spite of the sudden pain and\nbewilderment he smiled as he realized how the unexpected played its part\nin life.  Di in Maverick!\n\nThere was no time to reason it out.  He could not see Henry, only Sir\nJohn.  He saw Diana watching with curiosity the place and its occupants.\nHe mingled quickly with the crowd at the bar, hoping they would leave\nshortly.\n\nSir John was continuing his tirade against the ranchmen, and vainly\ntrying to persuade Diana to return to the car.  She was examining some\ncrude pictures on the walls.\n\n\"When they wish,\" Sir John said, \"these fellows shoot out the lights,\nthe windows, and the bar furnishings.  They are very whimsical\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nthe American humor that they talk so much about.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care for\nwhimsies myself.\"  Diana began to laugh.  Really, she was thinking, she\nhad never known how absurd and old-womanish Sir John could be.  But he\ncontinued: \"Then, if you don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see fit to respond to their silly gayety,\nthey kill you, by Jove! that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see the joke of it, you\nknow.  For example, one of them comes in here and invites us all,\nbelieve me, to drink with him.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not the proper thing to reply,\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099Thanks awfully, old chap, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not thirsty,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0099I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve just had a\ndrink,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 or \u00e2\u0080\u0099Excuse me, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 because if you say that, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very\nangry, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know.  You have offered him a deadly insult; he does\nnot know you, never saw you before, hopes never to see you again, and\nyet if you do not drink something which you do not want he kills you.\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deliciously whimsical now, isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\"\n\n\"Cousin John, if I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know your reputation as a soldier, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think\nyou were afraid.\"  Diana, followed by Sir John, moved nearer the corner\nwhere Jim was standing.\n\nJim could see the sweet beauty of her face.  He felt a sudden dizziness.\nIt was more than he could endure.  He started to leave, when he felt\nBill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand on his shoulder.\n\n\"This place is too stuffy for me; I must get out into the air,\" he\nexplained.\n\n\"Leave the saloon now, Jim!\" Bill exclaimed, in amazement.  Surely Jim\nwas not weakening.  \"If you ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t here to face Cash Hawkins when he\ncomes back you lose your standing among the people with whom you live.\nYou ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to do that, are you, boy?\"\n\n\"Oh yes\u00e2\u0080\u0094Cash.\"  With the remembrance of Hawkins came the resolve to\nremain in the saloon until Diana left.  He must be there to protect her\nif necessary.  \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d forgotten Cash; I was thinking of something else,\nBill.\"  Then, as he encountered Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s searching eyes, he added, \"Oh\nyes; remember, if Cash returns, each of you pick your man and leave him\nto me.\"\n\nHe drew closer to the crowd at the bar; Diana was not likely to venture\nthere.  She had joined Henry, and, with Sir John, they were about to\nleave the place.\n\nSuddenly there was the sound of the clattering of a troop outside.  At\nevery entrance to the saloon\u00e2\u0080\u0094and there were four\u00e2\u0080\u0094a man entered\nflourishing a gun, while through the centre door rushed Cash, who by\nthis time had worked himself up into a frenzy of passion.  Straight into\nthe ceiling he shot his revolver, and said:\n\n\"Nick, every one in the Long Horn drinks with me.\"\n\nEvery means of egress was barred by Hawkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s men.  Jim drew behind\nBill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s burly figure.  If only Cash would allow the strangers to go, was\nhis one thought.  Henry looked at Sir John; Diana, half frightened,\ngrasped a chair.  The men in the place made a hurried rush towards the\nbar; deep in rows they stood there.  Then Cash noticed the three\nfigures; but it only added to the zest of the situation for him. Diana,\nwatching his cruel face, realized that Sir John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s yarn of adventure\nmight prove a true one.\n\nThe saloon waited in silence.\n\n\n\n\n                             *CHAPTER XVI*\n\n\nCash had been drinking heavily all day, but there was no sign that it\nhad weakened his faculties.  On the contrary, the exhilaration of the\nliquor served to strengthen his dogged humor as he compelled the inmates\nof the saloon, strangers and all, to do his bidding.\n\n\"By Jove, Di, we are in for it,\" Sir John muttered. Then he turned\nirritably to Henry, who was close to him, \"You have let us get in for a\nnice mess up.\"  He was not afraid, but more than anything in the world\nhe disliked a scene.  He had travelled enough to know that they were at\nthe mercy of the rough humor of these men.  When occasion warranted he\ncould match others in decision and courage, but he also knew that the\nconsequences of the present situation were apt to be needlessly\nunpleasant.  From the beginning he had been averse to Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s allowing\nDiana to come with them; however, they must find a way out of it.  He\nbegan to survey the crowd of men critically.\n\nJim, who was watching Diana, spoke, though still hidden among the crowd\nat the bar.\n\n\"There are some outsiders, Hawkins, from the train.  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t care to\nmix them up in our festivities, I suppose.\"  By humoring Cash he also\nhoped to find a way out for Diana and the others. His voice attracted\nSir John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention.\n\n[Illustration: \"SHE DREW HERSELF UP CLOSE TO HIM, AND SAID \u00e2\u0080\u0099ME KILL\n\u00e2\u0080\u0099UM\u00e2\u0080\u0099\" See page 202]\n\n\"Quite so,\" he rejoined.  \"We have had a delightful time, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you\nknow.\"  Then he turned to the desperado, who, with the smoking pistol\nstill in his hand, was leaning against the centre-table and laughing at\nthe strangers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 discomfiture.  \"Awfully jolly of you to invite us, but\ncircumstances over which we have no control, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you know\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"  He grew\npainfully muddled.\n\n\"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right, pane in the face,\" said Cash.\n\nSir John dropped his eye-glass in disgust.\n\n\"Circumstances over which you have no control,\" sneered Cash.  \"You\ndescribe the situation accurate. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m a-runnin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 this here garden-party,\nand I ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to let anybody miss the fun\u00e2\u0080\u0094savvy?\"\n\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s intervention had only hurt their chances of escaping from the\nsaloon.  Cash motioned his men, with their drawn guns, to stand close at\nthe entrances. Jim saw Diana turn pale.  He forgot everything; he only\nknew that she stood there\u00e2\u0080\u0094that at this moment Henry and Sir John were\npowerless to help her.  He must get her away from the place; he would\nagree promise Cash whatever he wished in return\u00e2\u0080\u0094only Diana must be\nallowed to leave.\n\n\"But the lady\u00e2\u0080\u0094you won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t detain the lady against her will?\"  He knew the\nweakness of Cash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nature; to appeal to him as a gallant might be\nefficacious.  In his earnestness to carry his point Jim stepped out from\namong the men around the bar.\n\nAlmost simultaneously a low cry of \"Jim\" broke from Henry and Diana.  It\nwas followed by an ejaculation from Sir John.  It passed unremarked, and\nJim determined to ignore what his impetuous folly had brought upon him.\nCash was oblivious of everything save his revenge.  He bowed low to\nDiana\u00e2\u0080\u0094he would be polite to the lady, even if the request came from Jim.\n\n\"I am going to give the lady the chance to see how an Englishman looks\nwhen he has to take his medicine.\"  He looked at Diana.  \"She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sure a\nthoroughbred\u00e2\u0080\u0094she ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t batted an eye nor turned a hair.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet a\nhundred to one she stays.\"\n\nDiana could at that moment have passed out of the saloon, leaving Henry\nand Sir John there, but she saw only Jim.  It _was_ Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jim in those\nstrange clothes\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jim so bronzed, so strong, so masterful.  What a\ncontrast to Henry!\n\nCash waited for her answer.  He adored playing to the gallery\u00e2\u0080\u0094this was\nheightening the situation beyond all expectation.\n\n\"She stays,\" he finally said.  \"Good!  Gents, this is to be a nice,\nquiet, sociable affair\u00e2\u0080\u0094ladies are present.  Any effort to create trouble\nwill be nipped in the bud.  Gents, to the bar.\"\n\nHe turned to Henry and Sir John as he spoke.  He had a contempt for the\nmen, but there was something about this quiet, dignified woman that\nembarrassed him, though he would have been the last to admit it. A few\nmore drinks and he might be dangerous, but at present he was still\nmaster of himself.  His game was to make Jim and his gang ridiculous\nbefore the strangers.  Afterwards\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, then the serious settling of\ntheir score should come.  He took a glass that was handed him across the\nbar and gulped down its contents.\n\nHenry was whispering to Diana, \"For God\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, go\u00e2\u0080\u0094you can, and later we\nwill follow you.  This will be over in a minute.\"  But Diana only held\ntighter the rail of the chair.\n\n\"We can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drink with this confounded bounder, Henry,\" Sir John\nexpostulated.  \"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too absurd, you know.  Her Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s officers can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ndo a thing like that, now can they?\"\n\n\"We must humor the drunken brute, Sir John, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only way out of\nit.\"\n\nThat Jim was there none of them acknowledged to each other.  Events were\nassuming a strange unreality.  What had been meant for a half-hours\ndiversion was involving them in a highly dangerous situation.  The\nsaloon grew hotter\u00e2\u0080\u0094little air reached them through the barred doorway.\nStill Diana did not go.  The old imperative cry, stifled for the last\ntwo years, awoke again.  She forgot the dust, the hot saloon, the\nswaggering crowd of ranchmen.  The noise and wild excitement fell on her\nunheeding ears.  Jim was there, and his presence held her rooted to the\nspot.\n\nJim had moved into a corner at the lower end of the bar, and furtively\nwatched Cash and his men.\n\n\"Step up lively, sonny,\" Cash called to Sir John and Henry, \"or you may\nhave to dance the Highland fling.\"\n\nSir John stole a look of self-justification at Diana, but she did not\nsee it.  It was turning out just as he had told her.\n\n\"And shoot our toes off, by Jove,\" he whispered to Henry.  \"And he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do\nit, too, confounded bounder!\" he muttered, as both men went towards the\nbar and were met by Pete, who handed them each a glass of evil-looking\nwhiskey.\n\nCash began to direct the scene.  \"Hand out the nose-paint, gents.\"\n\nEvery one took a drink, Jim too; for her sake he would do as Hawkins\nwished.  It would be the quickest way to end this part of the business.\nThe serious end of it would follow when they were alone.\n\nSuddenly Cash, whose last two drinks were rendering him more offensive,\nand who was determined to annoy Sir John as well as Jim, said, \"Gents,\nto the success of the Boers.\"\n\nTo the crowd it was a foolish toast; it meant nothing to them.  But they\nhad hardly begun to toss off their drinks when there came a crack of\nglass, as Sir John Applegate threw his tumbler on the floor and said,\n\"No, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be damned.\"\n\nCash turned on him with an imprecation, and started to cover him with\nhis gun.  This unexpected diversion was the chance that Jim had been\nlooking for.  In an instant he had thrown his untasted liquor into Cash\nHawkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.  It blinded Cash. Involuntarily he fumbled with his\nguns, and in an instant Jim had thrust his revolver into Cash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side.\nThere was a moment of pandemonium as Cash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imprecations filled the air.\nThe men at the door started forward, but they had to pay for the\nmoment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lowering of their guns.  Big Bill and Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s men had been\neagerly watching their opportunity, and speedily covered Cash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gang.\n\n\"Put your hands up quick,\" Jim ordered.\n\nCash, with visible reluctance, complied.  There was a suppressed madness\nof excitement in Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice as he said to Sir John Applegate: \"Oblige\nme by relieving the gentleman of his guns; it will tire him to hold it\nup there too long.\"  Sir John obeyed.  It was a critical moment\u00e2\u0080\u0094one\nnever knew which way a crowd in a saloon would veer, and there might\nhave been a riot if Cash had been more popular.  As it happened there\nwas a laugh at Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words.  Sir John reached for the guns.  Cash, gaunt\nand terrible to look at, stood still while they were taken from him. The\npressure of the muzzle at his side caused him to loosen his final\nreluctant finger.\n\n\"Delighted, charmed, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure,\" Sir John agreed.\n\nJim, still covering Cash with his gun, drove him up against the bar.\nThose of the crowd who knew him realized that they were seeing a new man\nin the Englishman.  He was conscious of Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s luminous face back of\nhim, of Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gray countenance close to her as he quietly expostulated\nwith her.  The crowd swung close to the new boss.  This was what they\nwanted.  They believed he would prove the new leader for Maverick.\n\n\"Every man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands on the bar,\" the Englishman called, and he and his\nmen covered the crowd at these words.  \"I ask you,\" Jim quietly said,\n\"to drink with me to the President of the United States.\"\n\nMen who had cursed their President, defied the laws of the country that\nhad elected him, and who were fugitives from the justice of their land\nwere touched by the simple and tactful toast.  All glasses were raised.\nThey were about to drink, but the first sentence was followed by the\nwords:\n\n\"And to her Gracious Majesty, the Queen.\"\n\nThis time Jim stood ready to shoot; but it was unnecessary\u00e2\u0080\u0094the crowd\nechoed the toast.  Why not? The Englishman was right.  Their\ncountry\u00e2\u0080\u0094then his.  Not a bad sort.  So the murmurs went around.\n\nSuddenly Hawkins said, as he watched Sir John:\n\n\"Your little glass-eyed friend don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drink.\"\n\nSir John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glass was still untouched.\n\n\"Oh yes, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to drink,\" Shorty cut in, as he crossed to the group\nnear the table.\n\n\"Ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t nobody excused on a formal show-down like this!\" Bill called.\n\nBut Sir John, carried away by indignation at Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s daring to propose\nthat toast to the country and the sovereign he believed Jim had so\ndishonored, vehemently answered:\n\n\"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m an officer in her Majesty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s service, and, by Jove!  I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t drink\nwith a man who fled from England after robbing the widows and orphans of\nthe Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s soldiers, and you can do what you jolly well like about it.\"\n\nAll eyes were turned on Jim.  Would he kill the stranger?  Henry held\nDiana by the arm.  Jim grew pale under the strain of the moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nintensity.\n\nCash was the first to speak.  \"What do you say to that?\" he drawled,\nafter a prolonged whistle.\n\nBut Jim kept his eyes fastened on Sir John.  \"If I were the man you\nthink me,\" he said, \"you would never have finished that sentence.  You\nhave evidently mistaken me for some one else.  My name is Jim Carston,\nand I never took a penny that did not belong to me.\"\n\nEven to Sir John the words rang true, but he had lost all control\u00e2\u0080\u0094he was\ndetermined to avenge the old score of dishonor against his regiment.\n\n\"Why, confound your impudence, there stands your cousin, Henry Kerhill!\"\n\nThe crowd swung around.  This was the moment\u00e2\u0080\u0094it had been a day for\nMaverick.  What were they now to learn of Cash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \"angel-face\"?\n\nHenry crossed to Jim and faced him.  There was a pause.  \"Yes,\" he\nanswered, with as much nonchalance as he could assume, \"I believe the\ngentleman does bear a certain bald resemblance to the man you mean, but\nit is evidently a case of mistaken identity.\"  Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes were\nfollowing him with their mute appeal.  He continued: \"You will observe,\nSir John, that I drank the toast.  I trust you will not refuse to drink\nto our Queen with these gentlemen in a foreign country.\"\n\nThe ranchmen liked these Englishmen.  They were being treated with great\nconsideration; the little one was amusing but he was all right.  So ran\nthe verdict of the Long Horn saloon.\n\nSir John Applegate stood unconvinced.  Henry\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes were fastened on\nhim, and he read there something that held a reason for his denial.  At\nall events he had been most unwise\u00e2\u0080\u0094he knew that now\u00e2\u0080\u0094and he must, for\nDiana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake, undo his hasty words.\n\n\"Well, of course,\" he began, as he realized that further comment would\nbe futile, \"I was under the impression that I hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had a drink\u00e2\u0080\u0094not\none, by Jove!  Well, I must be squiffy.\"  The cow-punchers laughed.\n\"Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s,\" he finished, \"to her Gracious Majesty the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0094God bless\nher!\"\n\nBig Bill, who would have been an arch-diplomat in another sphere of\nlife, said:\n\n\"Not forgettin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 his Gracious Majesty the President, you know.\"\n\nSir John rose to the occasion.  \"Oh, quite so\u00e2\u0080\u0094his Royal Highness the\nPresident\u00e2\u0080\u0094God bless him!\"\n\nThe men slapped one another in appreciation of the joke.  Sir John tried\nto drink the whiskey of the country, but with a sigh he said, after the\nfirst taste, \"Say, as I must drink, please make it Scotch.\"\n\nDuring the scene in the saloon the car had drawn down the line and was\nshunting up and down the rails in a way comprehensible only to the\npowers that control an engine.  Henry apprehensively looked towards the\ncar, and went to meet Dan, whom he could see at the farther end of the\nplatform.  The meeting with Jim had been painful, and he was almost at\nhis wits\u00e2\u0080\u0099 end.  As he could not force Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prompt withdrawal, he\nwould fetch Dan to insist upon the passengers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 return to the car.\n\nJim had seen Henry slip away unobserved.  Would Diana and Sir John never\ngo?  He could see that the excitement was beginning to tell on Diana.\nSuddenly she swayed\u00e2\u0080\u0094yet he dared not go near her.\n\n\"Bill,\" he called, \"the lady looks as though she were going to faint.\"\n\nSir John and Bill started towards Diana, but Bill was the first to reach\nher.  He quickly grasped her by the arm and steadied her.\n\nDiana smiled at him.  \"Thank you, I was dizzy for a moment.\"\n\n\"On behalf of the genuine cow-boys present, I must apologize to this\nlady for being forced to remain in a place like this.  You may go,\nmadam.\"  Jim spoke without looking at her.\n\n\"Thank you,\" Diana answered.  \"I am a bit shaken, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad I\nstayed.\"\n\nBill was still holding her hand as he drew a chair towards her.  \"You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\ntremblin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, lady.  Nick\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094he turned to the bar\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you got nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 in\nthe way of a ladies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 drink?\"\n\n\"Right off the bat.\"  Nick took a bottle from the pyramid behind the\nbar.  \"Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a bottle of Rhine wine as has been an ornament here for\nfifteen years.\"  As he spoke he dusted the slender-throated flagon.\n\"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unsalable.  I never tasted it but once, and I hardly knowed I had\nhad a drink.  It was just like weak tea; but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a regulation ladies\u00e2\u0080\u0099\ndrink, and if the lady will honor me, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sure on the house.\"\n\nDiana had sunk into the chair\u00e2\u0080\u0094she was too dazed to know what to do.  Sir\nJohn was near her.\n\n\"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s very kind of you, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure,\" Diana said. She took the glass from\nBill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand.  \"I feel better already.\"\n\n\"It \u00e2\u0080\u0099ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got no real substance to it, lady, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best Nick\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngot, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to have you accept it, jest to show that you know\nthat all Western men ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t bad men and all cow-boys ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t loafers.\"\n\nAs he spoke, Bill bowed low.  Like a gallant of old, he trailed his\nsombrero on the ground.  Some of the men began to feel sentimental\u00e2\u0080\u0094they\nwere like weather-cocks, responding readily with their susceptible\nnatures to the swaying influence of the moment.\n\nHardly knowing what she was doing, Diana sprang to her feet.  Jim would\nnot look towards her\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, then, she must send him some message.  \"I\nthink I understand,\" she said to Bill.  \"If you will let me, I would\nlike to propose a toast\u00e2\u0080\u0094will you let me?\"\n\nThe room echoed the assent of the men.  They were all cavaliers\u00e2\u0080\u0094all\nsombreros were off and all bowed low before Diana.  The cow-boy has much\nof the player in him.  Hardly able to steady her sweet, tremulous voice,\nDiana turned directly to Jim and moved nearer to him, while she lifted\nher glass high in the air.\n\n\"To the Queen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s champion, Mr.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"  She paused, her eyes were blinded, her\nbrain clouded.  What was the name he had called himself?  \"Mr.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" she\nagain repeated.\n\nBill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice answered, \"Jim Carston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his name, lady.\"\n\nHigher she held the glass.  Jim had turned in amazement.  Her eyes met\nhis.\n\n\"Mr. Jim Carston.\"  Her voice rang clear and vibrant this time.\n\n\"And every son of a gun in this hole drinks to that, or we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know the\nreason why\u00e2\u0080\u0094eh, boys?\" Bill jubilantly cried.  Their boss had brought\nglory to them that day.\n\n\"Jim Carston!  Jim Carston!\"  The name rang through the place, and the\ntoast was drunk with enthusiasm.  In the midst of it all the centre door\nwas thrown open and the conductor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big voice bawled:\n\n\"All passengers for the Overland Limited\u00e2\u0080\u0094all aboard!\"\n\n\n\n\n                             *CHAPTER XVII*\n\n\nThe tooting and whistling of the train began.  The men filed outside.\nIn the crush Cash Hawkins, who had been drinking steadily until he was\nnow in a decided state of inebriation, slunk down to the other end of\nthe platform.  Henry and Sir John assisted Diana to the car.  The\ncow-boys swarmed along the platform\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jim alone stood in the deserted\nsaloon.\n\nBefore he was aware of what was happening\u00e2\u0080\u0094that the train was about to\ncarry away this tie of his former life\u00e2\u0080\u0094he heard Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice call\n\"Jim.\"  She slipped from the lower step on which she stood and ran\ntowards him.\n\n\"Diana!\"  He seized her out-stretched hands\u00e2\u0080\u0094he must say something to\nher, but she would not let him speak.\n\n\"I shall always thank God for this day, Jim,  I couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe you\nwere\u00e2\u0080\u0094I never have.  Now I know the sacrifices you have made for me\u00e2\u0080\u0094now I\nknow I have the right to ask God to bless you and keep you and make you\nhappy.\"  Her voice broke; tears were falling on his hand.\n\nLady Elizabeth or Henry would never discuss the cause of Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ndeparture.  She had always persistently defended him to the world, and\nto-day her intuition had told her that for her sake Jim had shielded his\ncousin\u00e2\u0080\u0094her husband!  How could she accept it?\n\n\"And you, Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0094tell me you are happy.\"\n\n\"Happy?\"  Her eyes told him that it was only possible for her to be\nhappy now that she knew the truth.  \"I sha\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind the future now so\nterribly, because I can respect somebody.\"\n\nDan passed the open door.  \"All aboard, lady,\" he briskly called.\n\n\"Good-bye, Jim.  God bless you!\"  She felt herself being helped aboard\nby Dan; she tried to wave her hand to Jim.  The car moved, the whistling\nand ringing of the bell told of their departure.\n\nIt was Henry who led her to a chair and left her there.  That day he\npaid in full for his life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s misdeeds.\n\nJim never attempted to see the receding car; he could hear the noise of\nthe departing train and the cries of the boys as they hooted their\ngood-byes.\n\n\"Kiss the baby for me.\"  It was big Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice.\n\n\"What a baby Bill is himself!\"  Jim found himself saying.\n\n\"Tell Sadie to write,\" called Shorty.\n\n\"Und say\u00e2\u0080\u0094say for me too, you bet.\"  The voice of the German was drowned\nin the roar from the rest of the boys.  Only Grouchy, in silence, looked\non contemptuously.\n\nFrom down the platform came the yells of the men. Even Nick had deserted\nhis bar.  Still, Jim did not move.  He could hear it all; he knew what\nwas happening\u00e2\u0080\u0094that the train was steaming away.  He found himself\nwatching flies settle on a beer-glass.  Then he fell into a chair, let\nhis head slip on to his arms that lay across the table, his back to the\nbig entrance and to the smaller one at the other side of the room. There\nwas no movement from him that told of the agonies he was enduring.  The\nflies buzzed at will about the place.\n\nThe door at the side swung silently open and Nat-u-ritch slipped into\nthe room.  In her soft moccasins her steps made no sound.  She crept\ntowards Jim, amazed to see him lying thus.  She shook her head\u00e2\u0080\u0094she could\nnot understand this mystery.  She was about to move closer to Jim when\nshe heard some one coming.\n\nThrough the door at the back she could see the crowds returning from the\ndeparted train, while from the other direction came Cash Hawkins\u00e2\u0080\u0094she\ncould see him clearly.  Closer came his steps.  Quickly she slid behind\nthe door, and from without peered into the saloon.  Cash, aflame with\npassion and liquor, entered and saw that Jim was alone.\n\nHe drew both his guns.  With an evil smile he advanced upon Jim.  \"Damn\nyou, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got you!\" he hissed; but before he could pull the trigger\nthere was a flash, a report, and Cash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands were thrown up in a\nconvulsive movement while he pitched forward on his face.  Dazed,\nbewildered, Jim got to his feet and mechanically pulled his gun; then,\nbefore he was aware of what had happened, he was bending over the body\nof Hawkins.\n\nThe report was followed by an excitable rush of the crowd into the\nsaloon.  The gamblers and cattlemen were headed by Bud Hardy, the County\nSheriff. Big Bill, Andy, Grouchy, and Shorty went at once to Jim, who\nstill stood close to the prostrate figure cf Cash Hawkins.  Pete quickly\nknelt beside the body, and turned Cash over to examine him.  Bud Hardy\nstood in the centre of the room.\n\n\"Hold on there!  Nobody leaves without my permission.\"  Then to Pete,\n\"How is he?\"\n\n\"He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cashed in, Sheriff.  Plumb through the heart.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think I ever\nsee neater work.\"  He laid the body on its back and crossed the arms\nover the breast.\n\nHardy walked direct to Jim.  \"Jim Carston, hand over your gun.\"\n\n\"And who are you?\" Jim asked, as he looked at the tall, bulky figure of\nBud Hardy.  He had forgotten that Bill, earlier in the afternoon, had\npointed out this man to him, and warned him of his friendship with Cash\nHawkins.\n\nGathered about Bud were Hawkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s faction, who resented the Englishman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npresence among them, and with them several who, only a few hours ago,\nhad been cheering Jim.  Bud Hardy answered his question with tolerant\namusement.\n\n\"The County Sheriff,\" he said.\n\nTo the surprise of all, Jim advanced and handed his gun to Bud.\n\n\"Come on, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re my prisoner.\"  Even Bud felt that this was extremely\ndifficult.  No resistance from the prisoner\u00e2\u0080\u0094no denial!  It was unusual.\nBut as he stepped towards Jim he was stopped by Bill.\n\n\"Wait a minute, Bud; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be in such a ferocious hurry.  Where you\ngoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to take him to?\"\n\nBill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart beat fast, but he gave no sign of the fear that filled him.\nHe knew what this might mean for the boss.  The faces of the other men\nof Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ranch grew gray\u00e2\u0080\u0094they too realized, far more than Jim did, that\nit was not the justice of the law that was to be his, but\u00e2\u0080\u0094well, the\ncrowds grew blood-thirsty sometimes in Maverick.  They had seen sights\nthat the boss had not\u00e2\u0080\u0094an ugly swinging vision passed before their eyes,\nbut no hint was given of this by the men. Each one knew that it would be\nthe most unwise move they could make for the boss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake.\n\nBill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s big, slow voice was heard again in its careless drawl.  \"Wait a\nminute, Bud; don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be in such a ferocious hurry.  Where you goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to\ntake him to?\"\n\n\"County jail, of course, at Jansen,\" was Hardy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s answer.\n\nBill then asked, as he surveyed Hawkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gang, who were whispering\ntogether with several of the hangers-on of the place, \"How do you know\nthe friends of the deceased won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t take him away from you and hang him to\nthe nearest telegraph-pole, eh?\"\n\nIt was lightly said, and as he said it Bill laid his big hand on Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nshoulder.  He must conciliate the Sheriff, gain time\u00e2\u0080\u0094anything.\n\nBut Bud shook Bill off.  \"Are you goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to interfere with me in the\ndischarge of my duty?\" he blustered.\n\n\"Not a bit, Bud, not a bit,\" Bill said; then, with sudden resolve\u00e2\u0080\u0094it\nwould mean his life, and the lives of others against them, perhaps, but\nhe meant to fight if necessary\u00e2\u0080\u0094he added: \"But we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to see that\nyou do it.  We ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t afraid of a trial and a jury.\"  He took the crowd\ninto his confidence.  \"There isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a jury in the State that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\npresent the prisoner with a vote of thanks and a silver service for\ngettin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 rid of Cash Hawkins.\"\n\nHe turned to Bud with his men about him. \"Who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to help you take\nhim seventy-five miles to jail?\" he demanded.  \"Will you swear us in?\"\n\nBut Bud only answered, \"You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t intimidate me, Bill.\"\n\n\"As defunct has a gun in each hand it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a plain case of self-defence,\nanyway.\"  Bill pointed to the two revolvers still clutched in the dead\nman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s stiffening hands.\n\n\"I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stand for this,\" thundered Bud.  \"Clear the room.\"\n\nHe had been rather a friend of Big Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00e2\u0080\u0094most of them were in\nMaverick\u00e2\u0080\u0094so he had listened to him longer than he would have to any of\nthe other men, but now he was through with his arguments, he must assert\nhis authority.\n\n\"Clear the room; this prisoner goes with me.\"\n\nThere was a movement from the crowd.  Bill looked appealingly at Jim.\nWhy would not the boss speak?  Just as the crowds had reached the doors\nJim said to Bud, who was advancing to formally arrest him:\n\n\"Wait a minute.  Take the trouble to examine my gun.\"\n\nBud lifted Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gun and looked at it closely. \"Well?\" he asked.\n\n\"You see it hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been discharged.\"\n\nBud quickly verified the fact that the gun was completely loaded.  He\npaused a moment irresolute. Then, with a sudden suspicion, he said:\n\n\"You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had time to reload it.\"\n\nThe men were eagerly watching the scene between the two men.\n\n\"Smell it,\" Jim said, quietly.  \"I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had time to clean it.\"\n\n\"Ah!\" Bill breathed.  It was like Jim to play the trump card.\n\nBud Hardy lifted the revolver to his nose.  It was as clean and\nfresh-smelling as a bit of cold steel. There could be no doubt that it\nhad not been used, and Jim had all these men as witnesses to prove it.\nIt would be useless to try to make a case of this. Bud knew when he was\nbeaten.  He took the revolver and handed it to Jim.\n\n\"Well, who did it, then?\"  He glanced at Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s men.  \"Would you\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all\noblige me by giving me a sniff of your guns?\"\n\nThe relief was so great that the men hysterically crowded Bud, and\nalmost as one man they thrust their revolvers into Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.\n\n\"Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my smoke,\" said one.\n\nBud drew back.  \"One at a time\u00e2\u0080\u0094one at a time,\" he gasped\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"if you\nplease.\"\n\nThen one by one the men filed past him as each held his revolver to\nBud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nose.\n\n\"Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my smoke-machine,\" Bill said.  It was passed by Bud without a\nword.\n\n\"Und mine,\" said Andy.\n\nGrouchy jerked his into Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face with the words, \"Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mine, and not\na notch on it.\"  And Bud could not deny the truth of the assertion.\n\nAll that Shorty nervously demanded was, \"How\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that?\" as he jerked the\nrevolver into Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.\n\nIn Maverick this was evidence enough for Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0094evidence that so far all\nwere free to go.\n\n\"Why didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all say so before?\" he growled, annoyed at the turn\naffairs had taken.  Then he saw the expression on their faces, laughter\nand glee as they crowded around Jim; when they looked at him, tolerant\namusement.  The smelling of the smoke-machines they regarded as a fine\nnew move on their part.\n\n\"Damn it,\" Bud thundered.  \"You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been astringin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 me while the guilty\nman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s escaped; but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll git him\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll git him yet.\"\n\nJim saved!  It was all that the boys wanted.  With a whoop-la, they tore\nafter Bud.  Down the platform they fled, all in excitement with the new\nsensation of the moment\u00e2\u0080\u0094the hunt with Bud for the guilty man.\n\nNear the table lay a gray glove.  Jim stooped and picked it up, and put\nit quietly to his lips.  Bill, who had lingered near the door, suddenly\nturned and came back to Jim and put his arm about him.\n\n\"You just escaped lynchin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, Jim.\"  And Jim knew that Bill spoke the\ntruth.\n\nHe held the glove folded close in his hand as he answered, \"Yes, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nalmost sorry.\"\n\nBill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face became grave.  What did the boss mean? Was the game too hard\nfor him?  Was he afraid he would lose on the ranch deal?  He patted him\ntenderly, almost like a mother humoring a wayward child, without saying\na word.  Jim sank into a chair. Bill understood\u00e2\u0080\u0094the boss would like to\nbe alone, so he sauntered up to the back and joined Nick.  In his heart\nthere was but one thought: Jim should see how well they would all serve\nhim.  He swore a mighty oath that he would see the others did so, too.\n\nLeft alone, Jim sat staring straight ahead of him. Suddenly he realized\nthat the body of Cash Hawkins was still lying there.  He shuddered at\nthe cruel forgetfulness of the men.  He leaned forward and spoke his\nthoughts aloud:\n\n\"Who killed Cash Hawkins?\"\n\nHe felt a sudden touch on his hand; he turned; there, kneeling at his\nfeet, was Nat-u-ritch, who had entered unobserved and crept beside him.\nAs he looked at her she drew herself up nearer to him, and, leaning her\nchin on her hand, said:\n\n\"Me kill um.\"\n\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only answer was to place his hand over her face while he hurriedly\nlooked about the saloon. No one could have heard her.  He drew her to\nher feet and motioned her to go, saying that he would follow shortly.\n\nThat night Jim learned the truth, and his friendship with Nat-u-ritch\nbegan.\n\n\n\n\n                            *CHAPTER XVIII*\n\n\nAfter this Jim often met Nat-u-ritch.  On his trail across the country\nhe would see her on her little pony galloping after him.  Sometimes she\nwould join him and silently accompany him on his search for the cattle\nthat had strayed beyond the range.\n\nNat-u-ritch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life with her father, Tabywana, was passed in days of\nuneventful placidness.  Since the death of Cash Hawkins the Chief had\ngiven her no cause for anxiety.  Concerning the murder, neither she nor\nher father spoke.  Tabywana admired Jim Carston; he seemed to realize\ninstinctively what Jim had saved him from that day at the saloon, and\nhis unspoken devotion, sincere and steadfast, often caused him to serve\nJim without any one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge.\n\nSometimes when Nat-u-ritch returned from a long day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ride her father\nwould scrutinize her, and as he read in her the call of her nature for\nthe Englishman, a curious smile would light up his face in sympathy with\nher.  He saw the unmoved impassiveness that she showed to all the young\nbucks that sought her, and without protest let her go her way, and her\ntrail always led towards Carston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ranch.\n\nWinter came with its treacherous winds, and Carston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ranch was more\ndesolate.  Of Nat-u-ritch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unspoken devotion to him there was no doubt\nin Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind, and the temptation to take her proffered companionship\ninto his lonely life rose strong within him. After Cash Hawkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death,\nJim, had he cared for the life, might have been a leader in the Long\nHorn saloon, but a bar-room hero was not the role that he wished to\nplay.  His own men\u00e2\u0080\u0094Grouchy, Andy, and Shorty\u00e2\u0080\u0094openly expressed their\ndisappointment to Big Bill at the boss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s indifference to the position he\nmight exert as a power in Maverick, and even Big Bill only vaguely\nunderstood Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unappreciative attitude.  He often watched Jim smoking\nhis pipe and peering into the heart of the embers that glowed on the\nhearth, and as he saw the careworn face Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great heart ached with\nsympathy for him.  But Jim, as he realized the difficulties of the fight\nin which he was involved, only clinched his fists the tighter and\naccomplished the work of three men in his day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s toil.\n\nAt these times the physical drain on him was so great that there was no\nopportunity left in which to realize the biting ache of his loneliness.\nSo one bleak day succeeded another, with the slim, mute figure of the\nIndian girl ever crossing his path.\n\nThe early spring brought with it a sudden melting of the snow-capped\nhills and the ice-covered pools. The cattle grew more troublesome.  They\nseemed harder to control, or else the boys were more indifferent to\ntheir disappearance.  Big Bill had gone away on a deal for new cattle,\nso Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s energies were redoubled.\n\nOne day as he rode across the plains searching for a lost herd that had\nwandered towards Jackson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hole, the longing that the awakening spring\nhad brought with it grew more insistent.  Life surely held for him\npossibilities greater than this, he told himself.  He resolved, on\nBill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return, to arrange with him to sell the place.  He could not\nconquer the craving for the old haunts of civilization that took\npossession of him.  He closed his eyes to shut out the endless stretch\nof prairie.  Lost in his dream to escape from his lonely life and to\ntake part again in the affairs of men of his own class, he failed to\nnotice the small pony that followed him carrying Nat-u-ritch.\n\nOn he went, so absorbed in his thoughts that he did not notice how close\nhe was to Jackson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hole. Big Bill long ago had warned him of the\ntreacherous ridge that lay near the gulley, but Jim had forgotten Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwords.  Unconscious of the danger ahead, he galloped towards the edge of\nthe broken precipice. In the distance he espied the marks of a herd of\ncattle that had passed around to the other side of the ridge. Jim urged\nhis horse forward and started to jump the small, deceptive span that\ncovered the hole.  A sharp cry came from Nat-u-ritch, who had quickly\ngained ground on him as she saw his intention.  But Jim, unheeding, gave\na sharp command to his horse and urged him over.  There was a sudden\nbreaking of ground; then a whirling, dazed moment through which flashed\nan eternity of thought, and Nat-u-ritch stood alone, clinging to her\npony as she peered over into the dark pool of broken ice around which\nstretched chasms of impenetrable blackness.\n\n\nTwo weeks later Jim opened his eyes to consciousness in Nat-u-ritch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nwickyup.  No man of those summoned by Nat-u-ritch to help had dared\nventure into the dreaded abyss, so Jim had been abandoned as dead.  But\nthe depth of her love gave the Indian girl the strength to accomplish\nhis rescue.  Jealous of her treasure, she dragged the unconscious body\nto her own village, which was nearer than Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ranch.\n\nThen followed an illness from the long exposure in the gulley.  Big Bill\nreturned, only to find the ranch without its master, while Jim lay in\nthe squaw\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wickyup, with the Indian girl fighting to save his life, her\nlove and loyalty making her his abject slave.\n\nWeeks followed, and one day Big Bill and the boys brought the boss home.\nThen came a relapse, and again Nat-u-ritch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s devotion and courage gave\nhim back his life.  This time Bill watched a double fight: the fight on\nthe part of the woman to save the man so that she might win him for\nherself, and on Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part an effort to resist the mute surrender of the\nwoman.\n\nWithout the boss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s supervision the ranch had deteriorated, and Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\naffairs had become so involved that he recovered only to find that all\nthought of abandoning the place was now impossible.  His dream of escape\nwas now a hope of the past.  And so life began afresh for him on the\nplains.\n\n\nJim stood outside of the window of an adobe hut. From within he could\nhear the low moans of a woman and now and then the wail of a child.  He\nwas alone, save for the missionary who had married him a few months\nbefore to Nat-u-ritch, and who was now inside helping the sick woman.\nBig Bill had gone to fetch an old squaw who had promised to come to the\nranch.  As Jim leaned against the post of the porch he was stirred by a\nmultitude of emotions. The wails from within grew louder and more\nfretful. As he watched the heavens, ablaze with a thousand eyes, he\nwondered why the old woman had failed to come in time.  He hardly\nrealized what the past hour had meant to him.  A child had been given to\nhim! Something of the wonder of the eternal mystery was numbing his\nspirit.  The sick woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moans grew fainter, only the cry of the babe\npersistently reached him.\n\nAt last the missionary came to him: Nat-u-ritch was asleep; he would go,\nhe explained, and hurry along the Indian woman who was coming with Big\nBill to the ranch.  The cry of the child seemed to become more pitiful.\nJim tiptoed to the door of the inner room.  On the cot lay Nat-u-ritch.\nHe softly crossed to the small bundle of life rolled in the blanket and\nlifted it in his arms.  The warm, appealing little body lay limp against\nhim.  He began swaying to and fro until the cry grew fainter.  Soon the\nbabe slept; but Jim still stood rocking his son in his strong arms.\n\n\n\n\n                             *CHAPTER XIX*\n\n\nOne year slipped into another, until five had passed since the birth of\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s son Hal.  The cattle did well and ill by turns, but mostly ill.\nThe trusts were making their iron paws felt by the grasp in which they\nheld the ranchmen\u00e2\u0080\u0094absolutely dictating their terms.  A dry season often\nfurther augmented the disaster of Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ventures.  Without repining he\nfought on, with only great-hearted Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advice and confidence to help\nhim through the wearing time.\n\nGreen River, which had been the excuse for Carston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ranch, was in low\nspirits this sizzling summer afternoon.  Throughout the long day the\nalkali plains had crackled under the withering sun, until the entire\nplace lay covered with a heavy powder of dust. Even the straggling\nscrub-oak and green sage-brush seemed to be only nature\u00e2\u0080\u0099s imitation of\nasbestos, so persistently were they radiating the heat of the past week.\nThe adobe stable glared at the low adobe dwelling opposite.  Neither\ngave evidence of any life within.  A decrepit wagon with its tongue\nlolling out lay like a tired dog before the stable; beside it was heaped\nthe dusty double harness with its primitive mending of rope and\nbuckskin, while near the house a disordered hummock of pack-saddles and\ncamp outfits further increased the disorder of the place. An unsteady\nbench, holding a tin basin, a dipper, and a bucket of water, and a\nsolitary towel on a nail near by, were the sole tributes to\ncivilization.\n\nBig Bill, whose eyes were accustomed to the place, seemed indifferent to\nthe unspeakable desolation of the ranch.  He sat on a log that lay\nbefore the door of the hut and was used for social intercourse or\nwood-splitting.  He was intent on braiding strands of buckskin, the ends\nof which were held by little Hal, who had grown into a winsome little\nlad and was the pet of all the men and his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s constant companion.\n\nAcross the river, towards the west, the same desolation met the eye.\nEven the sage-brush and scrub-oak seemed to have abandoned life in\ndespair, and the Bad Lands stretched lifeless to the foot-hills of the\nsnow-capped Uinta peaks.  Even more poignant than the cruel ugliness of\nthe place was the feeling that the great gaunt bird of failure brooded\nover the entire ranch.\n\nAs Bill clumsily twisted the braid the child eagerly watched him.\n\n\"Is it for me, sure, Bill?\" he asked, as he slid close to the big\nfellow.\n\n\"Yes, old man,\" Bill answered, as he stooped to pat the dark head.\n\"This is going to be for you, and there ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any old cow-puncher can\nbeat Bill making a quirt.  No, sirree.\"\n\nWhile he talked lightly to the child his mind was busy with unpleasant\nthoughts.  The boys were about to strike for their money.  Their wages\nhad been overdue for some time, and the boss, finally driven to the wall\nby disease among the cattle, had been unable to satisfy them.  So far\nthere had been no outbreak, but Bill expected it every moment.\n\nFor days Jim had hardly spoken.  That there was some important decision\nabout to be made by him, Bill guessed.  He sat and played with the\nchild, but in reality this was only a ruse by which he might keep close\nto the place and await developments.  From down the road he could hear\nthe men coming and calling to him, but he gave no sign.  He went on\nknotting the strands, and steadied little Hal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands when the child\ngrew tired of holding the quirt.\n\nShorty was the first to arrive, carrying his Mexican saddle and lariat.\nOn his diminutive face was stamped an aggressive pugnacity.  He was\nfollowed by Andy; Grouchy slouched in last, whittling at a piece of\nwood.  As Bill surveyed them he knew that they had been talking things\nover and had arrived at some conclusion.  They had been good workers in\ntheir time with him, and he knew even now, at heart, that they were not\nbad, but that life had tried them severely with its failures and\ndisappointments.  He waited for them to speak.  There was a moment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsilence, then Shorty, as he flung himself down on the bench, said:\n\n\"Say, Bill, I s\u00e2\u0080\u0099pose you know the boys is gettin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 nervous \u00e2\u0080\u0099bout their\nmoney, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\"\n\nBill just looked up, and then went on with his work as he answered,\n\"To-morrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pay-day.\"  He would not anticipate them in their rebellion;\nhe would make it hard for them to declare themselves.\n\n\"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what,\" Shorty went on.\n\n\"Well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s time to get nervous day after to-morrow.\"  And still Bill\nbraided the leather.\n\n\"They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to make trouble if they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t git it.\"  Shorty acted as\nspokesman.  Grouchy and Andy only nodded their heads in approval of\ntheir leader\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words.\n\nBill stopped his work as he picked Hal up in his arms.  \"Are they?\" he\nsaid.  \"Well, I reckon Jim Carston and me can handle that bunch.\"  He\nspoke as though the others were not present.\n\n\"Maybe you kin; maybe you kin,\" Shorty retorted, as he flung the saddle\nagainst the walls of the cabin.\n\n\"Und say, Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0094und say\u00e2\u0080\u0094to-morrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pay-day.\" Andy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice trembled as he\nspoke.  He was a gentle-mannered German, and the sight of Hal was not a\ngood incentive for him to fight against the boss.\n\nHal began to listen and to look from one to the other.  Bill noticed the\nchild\u00e2\u0080\u0099s look of inquiry and set him on the ground.\n\n\"Son, you run in and help your mother with the milking.\"  He slapped his\nhands together as though a great joy were in store for the child, who\nlaughed with glee as he hurried across to the stable.\n\nThe men waited for Bill to say something, but he only stood twisting a\nstraw about in his mouth and pulling his hat-brim.\n\nAgain Andy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s courage rose and he walked close to Bill.  \"To-morrow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\npay-day, Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0094eh?\"\n\n\"Is it?  Do tell!  Ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you a discoverer!  Say, Andy, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re neglectin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nthe north pole a little.\"\n\nThis time it was Grouchy who answered, \"Well, I want mine,\" and he\nviciously dug his knife into the hitching-post.\n\nBill looked from one to the other.  Surely they would be reasonable; he\nwould try them.\n\n\"Boys, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s seven years since the boss bought this ranch, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had\nan up-hill fight.  Every one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s done him.  He bought when cattle was\nhigher than they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever been since, and you know what last winter did\nfor us; but he \u00e2\u0080\u0099ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever hollered, and the top wages he paid you at\nthe start he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been a-payin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 you ever since.\"\n\n\"Oh, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the use!\" Shorty interrupted.  \"The money is owed us.  The\nonly question is, do we git it?\"\n\nBacked up by Shorty, Grouchy began again, \"Well, I want mine.\"\n\nOnly gentle Andy was silent.  He could hear little Hal laughing as he\nplayed in the cow-shed.\n\nBill dropped his persuasive tone as he wheeled around on the men and in\na sudden blaze said:\n\n\"Well, you know Carston and you know me.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re lookin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for trouble,\nwe won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see you go away disappointed.\"  He squared his shoulders as he\nspoke.  \"Oh, shucks!\"  He looked at the boys again. \"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no use,\" he\nbegan, more good-naturedly.  \"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the business that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no good.  Nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\nin it.  The packers has got us skinned to death.  They pay us what they\nlike for cattle, and charge the public what they like for beef.  Hell!\"\nhe grunted, as he turned on his heel.  \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 into the ministry.\"\n\nThis time Grouchy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s \"Well, I want mine\" was extremely faint.\n\nBefore the others could speak again Bill quickly called, \"Here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the\nboss now,\" and signalled the men to be silent.\n\nThey were touched by Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s haggard face.  They had not seen the boss for\nseveral days; he had been busy with accounts, Bill had told them.  They\nbegan shuffling their feet as though about to leave.  Each one thought\nperhaps it would be as well to wait until the next day.  Shorty\nsignalled them to come on, but Jim stopped them.\n\n\"Boys, I hear you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re getting anxious about your pay.  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t blame you.\nMy affairs are in a bad way, but I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t expect any one to share my bad\nluck. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve earned your money.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see that you get it.\"\n\nAs Jim spoke he drew from his pocket several small boxes and from his\nbelt an old wallet.  \"I have some useless old trinkets here that have\nbeen knocking around in my trunk for years.  If you will take them to\ntown, where people wear such things, you will get enough for them to\nwipe out my account and something to boot for long service and\ngood-will.\"  Andy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sniffles were the only answer that followed.  Jim\nturned to him, \"Andy\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nBut Andy refused the package.  \"Und say, boss. Und say, I ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kickin\u00e2\u0080\u0099.\nUnd say, I can trust you.\"\n\nJim only tossed the box into his hands.  \"Shorty,\" he said, as he\nslapped the wallet across the little fellow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder.\n\n\"Oh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d rather not,\" Shorty shamefacedly answered. \"Gee, but this is\ntough work,\" he muttered to himself.\n\nJim smiled.  \"You must take it, please.  The man who refuses throws\nsuspicion on the value of my junk. You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do that, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m sure.\"  And\nthe wallet slid into Shorty\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand.\n\n\"Grouchy, you can have my repeating rifle,\" he added.  \"And now,\ngood-night.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see you to-morrow for the last time.\"\n\nSo this was to be the end of their association with the boss.  Would he\ntry to shoulder the work of the place without them?  A second\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nreflection told them that this would be impossible.  It was to be really\nthe end of Carston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ranch.  The three men stood staring at Jim.  Bill,\nat the back of the hut, as he heard the words, sank down on a rough\nbench.  This was what had come of the days of silence on Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part; in\neach man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heart there was an unspeakable emotion at the dissolution of\ntheir companionship.\n\nSuddenly down the road they heard the clatter of horses.  Then the\nwhoop-la of a crowd of men, and a stentorian voice called:\n\n\"Hello, any one to home at Carston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ranch?\"\n\nShorty and Andy hurried to meet the new-comers. It was Bud Hardy, the\nSheriff, with a posse of men. In they rushed, swarming all over the\nplace, and carrying with them the smell of alkali and the heat of the\nplains.  Dripping with perspiration, stained and worn with their travel,\nthey seemed like part of the desert, so covered were they with a heavy\ncaking of dust.  One felt the parched fever of their thirst as they\nstood asking hospitality of the ranch.  Jim advanced to meet them.\n\n\"Hello, folks,\" Bud called, as the men of the ranch welcomed his men.\nThen he came towards Jim, who shook hands with him.\n\n\"Why, how are you, Sheriff?\"\n\nSince the day at Maverick, when the Sheriff had tried to arrest him, Jim\nhad often seen Bud.  He was never sure of the honesty of the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nintentions, ne and Big Bill had often discussed Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unfitness for the\npower he held in the place, but he gave no sign of this in his greeting.\n\nBud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s great frame towered above the others.  He seemed more effusive and\nexcited than the occasion warranted, and Big Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brows rose\nquestioningly as he saw the demonstrative way in which he greeted Jim.\n\n\"Howdy, Mr. Carston\u00e2\u0080\u0094howdy?  Knowin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the hospitality of this here outfit,\nwe most killed ourselves to git here, to say nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of the horses.  We\nleft them leanin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 up against the corral, the worst done up cayuses.\"\nThen directly in appeal to Jim, he said, \"We simply got to stay here\nto-night, Mr. Carston.\"\n\nWith a cordial gesture of invitation, Jim said, \"You and the boys are\nwelcome, Sheriff, and what we lack in grub and accommodations we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hope\nto make up to you in good-will.\"\n\nAs Jim spoke, Bud quickly glanced in triumph at Clarke, a prominent\nworker in his posse.  The pale face of Clarke gave back a glance of\ncomprehension as he lowered his white-lashed eyelids over his bulging\neyes.  All this was observed by Bill, who sauntered towards the Sheriff\nas Bud answered Jim.\n\n\"What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good enough for you all is good enough for us, you bet,\" and he\nwrung Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand again. \"Why, hello!\" he finished, as he saw Bill and\nturned to greet him.\n\n\"Any news?\" Bill laconically asked, as he studied Bud and his men.\n\n\"Nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of any consequence,\" said Bud.  \"We just had a little fracas\ndown at the agency.  Total result, one Injin killed.\"\n\nA shout of approval rose from the boys, but Clarke broke in with another\nguffaw.  \"And the joke of it is, Bud killed the wrong man.\"\n\n\"But nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to it.  All in a day\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work,\" Bud laughingly explained.\n\n\"You look tired, Sheriff,\" Jim said.  \"The boys will take you to their\nquarters.  Shorty, you and the others make the Sheriff and his people\nfeel at home.\"\n\nThere was a murmur of approval.  \"Come on,\" said Shorty, and the men\nstarted for their quarters. Shorty, who loved bossing an affair almost\nbetter than teasing, swept them all on before him.  Then he linked his\narm through Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.\n\n\"Say, Bud, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet you a saddle to a shoe-string you never roped the\nman who killed Cash Hawkins at Maverick.\"\n\nClarke, who seemed deliberately to keep near Bud, gave an involuntary\nlook of surprise at the Sheriff, but the flash of anger on Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nblowsed, crimson face quickly cowed him.\n\n\"Oh,\" Bud said, lightly, \"that was years and years ago, Shorty,\" and\nwith his arm about him he followed the men towards their quarters.\n\nClarke lingered to cast a furtive glance at the hut and stables, but\nonly for a moment, for he quickly realized that Bill was intently\nwatching him.\n\nJim turned to go to the house\u00e2\u0080\u0094then paused.  He could see Bill against\nthe hitching-post tearing a straw into wisps that fluttered and fell\nlifeless to the ground. There was not enough breeze to carry even a\nstrand away.  He must speak to Bill, but how could he express anything\nof the desolation he felt at this parting of their ways.\n\n\"Bill,\" he began, in a low voice\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Bill, who divined the words that\nwere about to follow, made no answer; he only held tighter to the post.\nHe could hardly see the boss; a blur swept before his eyes.  He made no\neffort to move; he felt he could not.\n\n\"Bill,\" said Jim again, as he came to him, \"you must get out and look\nfor another job.\"  Jim clinched his hands tight as he added, \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be\nsorry to lose you, old man.\"\n\n\"I know you will,\" Bill huskily answered, as he kept his eyes lowered to\nthe ground.  Then, almost in a growl, he questioned, \"And what are you\ngoing to do, boss?\"\n\nThe despair of a broken man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life answered Bill as Jim said, in a\nlevel, flat tone, \"Sell out\u00e2\u0080\u0094move on\u00e2\u0080\u0094begin all over again\u00e2\u0080\u0094somewhere.\"\nThen with the indomitable will that was ever a part of him, he added,\nmore hopefully, \"There must be a place for me somewhere.\"  Mastering\nhimself, he added, as he took Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knotted hand in his, \"I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t offer\nto pay you, Bill.\"\n\nAnd Bill, who knew by this fineness of perception on Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part why he\nloved the boss, answered, \"You better not,\" and wrung Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand in both\nof his.\n\n\"Not now,\" Jim said, with the old hope again rising to encourage him,\nthat later he might be able to help Bill.  \"In my life I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had one\nfriend and only one.\"  He laid his hands on Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulders and looked\nstraight in his eyes.\n\nBut Bill could not stand the strain of it any longer. \"You make me\ntired,\" he gulped, and Jim smiled.\n\n\"Why did you pay those cayotes three or four times what you owe \u00e2\u0080\u0099em?\"\nBill scolded, gruffly, but kindly. \"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wicked, Jim.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a\nsentimental fool.\"\n\nAs though bestowing a final benediction, Jim answered, \"And you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re\nanother\u00e2\u0080\u0094God bless you,\" and then dropped on to the log and seemed to\nforget Bill and all about him.\n\nBill stood a moment, then tiptoed away while Jim sat watching the\nafternoon shadows beginning to creep up towards the hut.\n\n\n\n\n                              *CHAPTER XX*\n\n\nTowards noon the next day, Bud sought Jim to ask further hospitality.\nThe horses were still in bad condition, he explained, and he would\nesteem it an invaluable service if he would allow them to remain another\nnight on the ranch.  Jim readily acquiesced.  Now that he had taken the\nfinal step to sever himself from the ranch, there were many details to\nbe personally directed and settled.  Bill and he were often in\nconference, and the sale could be accomplished within a few days.  While\nBill worked, he watched Bud and Clarke.  Of his suspicion that they were\ntrying to take some unfair advantage, he did not speak.  Only his\nferret-like glances constantly followed them.  And his instinctive\ndistrust was further aroused by a visit from Tabywana.\n\nAs he and Jim sat before the house, with a list that Jim was explaining\nto Bill, Baco, the half-breed who worked about the place, suddenly\ncalled in greeting to Tabywana.  With his bonnet of gorgeous feathers\ntrailing down his back, his body draped in a blanket, and in his hand\nthe peace-pipe, the Chief entered. \"How!\" he answered, as he passed\nBaco.  Both Bill and Jim arose.\n\n\"Why, hello Chief!  Where\u00e2\u0080\u0099d you blow in from?\" Bill called.\n\nAgain Tabywana answered, \"How!\"\n\nJim advanced.  \"How!\" he said.  \"The peace chief never comes except to\ndo us a favor.  Baco, ask him what we can do for him.\"\n\nAs Tabywana pointed to his pipe he spoke to Baco.  \"He says, \u00e2\u0080\u0099Let us sit\ndown and smoke,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\" interpreted Baco.\n\n\"Certainly,\" Jim answered.  His years of living among the Indians had\naccustomed him to their ceremonies, and the four men crossed their legs\nand seated themselves on the ground, forming a half-circle. Tabywana\nbegan filling and lighting his pipe.\n\n\"Baco,\" Jim commanded, \"tell Tabywana that we are always glad to meet\nhim and see him face to face.  He is our friend.\"\n\nBaco quickly translated the message.  Tabywana began passing the pipe\nfrom Jim to Bill.  As Bill puffed at it he said to Jim, \"Say, when the\nold Chief gets as formal as this it means business.\"\n\nThe men, although eager to begin the proposed conversation, did nothing\nto urge the Indian to declare himself.  Both courteously awaited the\nChief\u00e2\u0080\u0099s information, although both chafed at this delay in their work.\nWhen the pipe had been returned to Tabywana he deliberately extinguished\nthe flame, and, holding the pipe under his blanket, began monotonously\nto speak in his own tongue.\n\nJim and Bill both tried to follow the words, but their knowledge of the\nlanguage was exceedingly limited, so Baco translated for them.  \"He says\na stranger has been asking for you in the settlement.\"\n\n\"What kind of a stranger?\" Jim asked, his mind turning at once to the\nsale that was about to be effected.  The Indian agent again interpreted\nthe Chief\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reply.  \"One who jumps up and down in his saddle.\"\n\nBill smiled as Jim answered: \"Oh, an Englishman. What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his business?\"\n\n\"The Chief says he does not know, but be on your guard.\"\n\nBill and Jim exchanged glances.  Surely it was not for this that\nTabywana had paid this formal visit.  But Jim, who knew the wary, slow\nmethods of the Indians, and who felt that something of more importance\nwas coming, looked straight at Tabywana, as he asked, \"Is that all?\"\n\nTabywana understood more of the language of his conquerors than he\nadmitted, and quickly answered the question through Baco.  \"No,\nsomething else\u00e2\u0080\u0094very important.\"  Then Tabywana himself added, \"Bud Hardy\nis here.\"\n\nAt these words Bill, who had been listening listlessly, turned sharply\nto watch the Indian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.  In the crafty, restrained expression he\ncould read the effort at control that the Chief was exercising as he\nemitted the sentences Baco translated for him to Jim.  \"That is bad\u00e2\u0080\u0094very\nbad.  Trouble will follow. He says Hardy has been talking and drinking a\ngreat deal, and has begun to talk about the death of Cash Hawkins, and\nHardy will, he is afraid, soon arrest some one.\"\n\nJim did not answer.  Tabywana moved a little so that he could watch Jim.\nHis face wore an expression of great curiosity as to how his words would\nbe received by Jim.  The Chief had never known the exact truth\nconcerning the killing of Cash Hawkins, but he had often guessed that\nNat-u-ritch and Jim did.  Jim did not answer.  Bill spoke to him as\nBaco, having performed his duty, sank back and began playing with some\nstraws.\n\n\"Jim, the old Chief is trying to tell you that Hardy has been bragging\nthat he was going to arrest the fellow that killed Cash Hawkins.\"  Jim\ngave no sign that the news in the least disturbed him.\n\n\"Tell the old Chief it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the fire-water that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s talking.\"\n\nBill sank deep into a reverie.  So Bud was up to some devilment\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\nwhat?  Then he heard the words:\n\n\"The Chief says that Hardy is no friend of yours,\" and Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quick\nreply, \"Tell the Chief I didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t kill Cash Hawkins, so I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not afraid of\narrest.\"  Jim smiled reassuringly at the Chief, who constantly watched\nhim.  After all, what could Bud do to Jim? \"He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a blow-hard, anyway,\"\nBill muttered.\n\nJim was about to rise and end the interview when, looking cautiously\nabout him, Tabywana began speaking in a lower tone.  Baco translated\nwithout pause the thoughts that were troubling the Indian. \"The Chief\nthinks that Hardy thinks that maybe Nat-u-ritch killed Cash Hawkins.\"\n\nJim only let slip the word \"Nat-u-ritch,\" but his eyes quickly sought\nthe Indian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s, and in them he saw there was fear for the woman.  To Bill\nthis seemed nonsense.  There had never been an atom of suspicion\nattached to Nat-u-ritch, so he lightly dismissed the idea with a laugh\nas he said, \"Bud must have been unusual drunk.\"  Bill had never\nunderstood the affair.  He now began to feel the old suspicion creeping\nback.  Had the boss, in self-defence, done the deed?  If so, he must\nkeep his watch all the closer on Bud and his men to see that they left\nthe ranch as quickly as possible.\n\nJim quietly and calmly gave this answer to the Chief:\n\n\"So Bud thinks Nat-u-ritch killed Cash.  Why, there isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a scrap of\nevidence pointing towards Nat-u-ritch.  Ask him what makes Bud think\nso.\"  This time Jim listened intently for the answer.\n\n\"He says he doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know.  But that Bud Hardy is bad medicine, and he\nwants you to make Bud Hardy move on to the next ranch.\"\n\nBill grunted his approval at this.\n\n\"That is impossible.  The Chief knows that we cannot refuse shelter to\nthe white man.\"\n\nBill this time upheld Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attitude in maintaining the laws of the\nplace as he added, \"Even though he is a bad man.\"\n\nTabywana looked from one to the other.  There was a piteous look of\nbaffled hope on his face.  In his heart he was wishing that they would\nnot take his words of wisdom so lightly, but it was difficult to explain\nmore to them.  Despairingly he offered further advice, and Baco repeated\nit for him, but Jim answered:\n\n\"The Chief knows that the rights of hospitality are sacred.  Besides, I\ndo not anticipate any trouble.\"\n\nHe rose to his feet.  He would be extremely wary of Bud Hardy, but he\nfelt no great concern.  The affair had passed for five years, and it was\nsimply some drunken bravado on the Sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s part that had frightened\nthe old Chief.  He laid his hands on Tabywana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulders.  For\nNat-u-ritch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father he had a tender regard, and the generous tolerance\nhe had for, and the defence he constantly made of, the red man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rights,\ncaused Tabywana to lay aside all cunning in his dealings with Jim, and\nto completely surrender his affections to him and the tiny child.\n\n\"Baco, tell Tabywana that no harm shall come to Nat-u-ritch while I\nlive, and say to the Chief he is a good friend and I thank him for\ncoming, and I would like him to accept this tobacco.\"\n\nThe eternal child in the Indian answered the last words, as Jim handed\nhim the gayly embroidered pouch, with a quick smile and nod of\nappreciation. He was about to protest further, however, when Shorty\ninterrupted them as he came running in. \"A stranger out here wants to\nsee the boss.\"\n\nAh, this was about the ranch, no doubt, so Jim said, \"All right, Shorty,\nbring him to me.\"\n\n\"All right, boss.\"\n\n\"Bill, show Tabywana on his way,\" Jim directed, as the Indian seemed\nloath to leave him.  \"Adios amigo,\" he called to Tabywana, as Bill\ngently pushed him away.  Baco followed him.\n\n\"I beg your pardon.  I am looking for Mr. Carston.\"\n\nBill amusedly surveyed the new-comer as he answered, \"There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Mr.\nCarston,\" and as he disappeared behind the house he muttered to himself,\nwith a backward glance at the visitor, \"Looks as though he blew off a\ncomic paper.\"\n\n\n\n\n                             *CHAPTER XXI*\n\n\nAnd it was to this that James Wynnegate had come, was the first thought\nof Malcolm Petrie as he surveyed the crude place with its marks of\npoverty and failure.  Like all those intimate with the Wynnegate family,\nhe knew of the mysterious disappearance of Jim Wynnegate at the time of\nthe embezzlement from the Relief Fund.  Although his brother, Johnston\nPetrie, had been the active adviser of the family, he had personally\nknown Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, and as he watched Jim now he began to feel a new\ninterest in him.  Since the death of his brother Johnston he had assumed\ncontrol of the Kerhill estate.  As he studied the worn man who stood in\nthe strong light of the afternoon, dressed in faded and patched\nriding-breeches, with a flannel shirt, and careless kerchief knotted\nabout his throat, and with roughened hands that showed their service in\nmanual labor, he thought of him as the soldier he had often seen in the\nLondon world.  But could those be the eyes of a man who was hiding from\njustice?  Again he looked at the slip of paper which was marked, \"Jim\nCarston, of Carston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Ranch.\"\n\nInstinctively Jim placed the man who stood before him.  Even though he\nhad never seen him before, the resemblance to his brother, Johnston\nPetrie, was unmistakable.  The light began to deepen into crimson\nshadows, and a stillness hung over the ranch.  All the men were away in\ntheir quarters, with Big Bill guarding them so that the boss should not\nbe disturbed in what he supposed was a possible chance to sell the\nplace.\n\nDiplomatically, Malcolm Petrie began, \"This is Mr. Carston?\"\n\n\"And you?\" Jim questioned.\n\nPetrie handed him a card as he said, \"Malcolm Petrie, of the firm of\nCrooks, Petrie & Petrie, solicitors, London, and at your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nservice.\"\n\nBefore Jim could speak, Petrie continued: \"Pardon my abruptness in\ncoming on you unawares. Most of the time I allowed myself has been given\nto locating you.\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Petrie, go on,\" was all Jim said, as he turned the card in\nhis hand.  He hardly knew what course to pursue.  Should he deny or\nacknowledge to this trustworthy man, who was regarding him with such\nsympathetic interest, that he was Jim Wynnegate? A hunger to learn\nsomething of the world he had left, to be allowed to listen longer to\nthe cultivated speech that fell with such beauty on his starved ears,\nassailed him.\n\n\"Crooks, Petrie & Petrie have been your family solicitors for so many\nyears that I had hoped to be remembered by your lordship.\"  Petrie was\ndetermined not to allow this man to escape for a moment from\nacknowledging his identity, so he pressed him close with his knowledge.\n\n\"Mr. Petrie,\" Jim said, \"we are plain people out here, where every man\nis as good as every other man\u00e2\u0080\u0094and a good deal better,\" he added, as he\nremembered the democratic status of the boys.  \"So please address me as\nMr. Carston.  Won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you be seated?\"  As he spoke he pointed to the bench\nnear the hut.\n\nPetrie adjusted his glasses, the better to observe the man, as he said:\n\"Since you desire it.  Only I have come a very long way to inform you\nthat you have a right to the title.\"\n\nThe cause of Mr. Petrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence flashed through Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind.  \"Then my\ncousin\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\"Is dead, my lord\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mr. Carston.\"\n\nMonotonously Jim repeated: \"Dead.  Henry should have outlived me.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to be the bearer of distressing news, your lordship\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nBut Jim interrupted.  \"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t humbug, Petrie. There was no love lost\nbetween Henry and me, as you know, though I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve tried to forget that.\"\n\nWhen he had recovered from the first surprise of this meeting, and had\nmore fully grasped the significance of Petrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s news, he inquired, \"I\nsuppose Henry left a statement at his death.\"\n\n\"Statement?\" the lawyer inquired.\n\nJim further explained.  \"Something in the nature of a confession.\"\n\n\"Confession?\"\n\n\"By Jove! he might have done that.\"\n\n\"His late lordship died very suddenly.\"\n\nBut Jim waited for no further details.  \"So he died without a word.  He\ndied leaving me a fugitive from justice.  So they still think me\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"  Then\nquickly the real facts of the case began to straighten themselves in\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind.  If Henry had not spoken\u00e2\u0080\u0094had left no confession\u00e2\u0080\u0094how and why\nhad Petrie sought him? Then he asked:\n\n\"Why have you come here?\"\n\nPetrie, who was constantly watching the effect of his every word on the\nman who more and more confused and interested him, slowly answered, \"I\nam here because your cousin, Lady Kerhill\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\"Diana?\"  Jim softly breathed the name, but said no more.\n\nPetrie continued: \"Believes that if you will speak\u00e2\u0080\u0094if you will break the\nsilence of years, you can return to England and assume your proper place\nat the head of your house, and in the world.\"\n\nSo it was to Diana he owed this.  \"Then there is one who still believes\nin me.  God bless her!\"  All restraint fell from Jim as he sat himself\nbeside the solicitor and said, simply, \"I did it for her sake, Petrie.\"\nThen, as though unconscious of the other man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence, he sat staring\nahead of him.\n\nHis surmise had been right, Petrie thought.  This man was not guilty.\nThe case began to assume new interest and new complications.  He must\nhear more. Jim roused himself.  From an inside pocket of his shirt he\ndrew a small bag which held a sheet of faded paper.\n\n\"You are familiar with the late Kerhill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s writing. You are also familiar\nwith his character and life. I have never allowed this paper to leave my\nbody.\"  As he spoke he handed the paper to Petrie.  \"But death has\ncancelled this agreement.\"\n\nPetrie read the document.  Jim sat motionless. As the sun dropped lower\nand lower towards the west, bolts of scarlet and purple seemed to be\nhurled from its blazing brilliance down on the cabin and the yard.\nPetrie broke the silence.\n\n\"So you took upon your shoulders his guilt?\"  In his tone there was no\ngreat surprise.\n\n\"Not for him, Petrie\u00e2\u0080\u0094for her.  It was too late for her to find out\u00e2\u0080\u0094well,\nwhat he was.\"  The rebellion against the dead man seemed to choke him.\nThen he added, \"I did it for her sake, Petrie.\"\n\nA restlessness took possession of Jim.  All the old memories and sorrows\nbegan to lay their withering hands upon him.  He crossed to the\nhitching-post and leaned against it as he watched with unseeing eyes the\npurple-and-red rays tipping the Uinta peaks.\n\nPetrie read the document again, and as he did so he wondered how much of\nthis Lady Elizabeth had known\u00e2\u0080\u0094how much Diana suspected.  He could see\nnow why she had decided to come with him to America.  He thought of her\nas he had seen her a few days ago at Fort Duchesne, of her eyes as she\nhad asked him not to fail in his search, and of her disappointment when\nher cousin, Sir John Applegate, who accompanied her, had protested\nagainst her riding out with Petrie on a venture which might take days,\nto end only in disappointment.\n\nHe went to Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side.  \"Lady Kerhill,\" he said, \"will be more grateful\nthan you know, for I am here as her ambassador to beg you to come back\nhome.\"\n\nInto the face of Jim came a wistful longing, so tender and yet so tragic\nthat Petrie turned away from this glimpse into a hurt soul.  He only\ndimly saw the man as he heard Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s whispered words:\n\n\"Home, eh?  Go back home!  By Jove! what that would mean!\"  Then, as\nthough a panorama were passing before him of his life on the ranch, he\nwent on: \"And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been away all those awful years in this God-forsaken\nplace.\"  There was a break in the low voice and the echo of a sob as Jim\nturned his back on Petrie.\n\nAgain the unlovely surroundings, with their evidences of pinched means,\ntheir stamp of neglect through want, impressed the solicitor.  Very\nquietly he said, \"It does look a bit desolate, Mr. Carston.\"\n\nJim, now master of himself, turned, and as he looked at the dusty\nplains, the sun-baked cabin, the parched, feverish land about him,\ncried: \"Desolate!  It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t look much like Maudsley Towers, with its\nparks and turrets, and oaks that go back to William the Conqueror, does\nit?\"  Before his eyes there came a picture of the home of his youth, of\nthe place of his manhood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s joy.  The word seemed to burn and tear at him\nwith its possibilities.  \"Home, eh?  I love old England as only an exile\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nHe forgot the West, with its disappointments, its scars, and its days of\npain, when memories of the past would not be stilled.  He came over to\nPetrie, and in a burst of almost boyish confidence poured out his inmost\nfeelings.  \"I love the English ways of doing things\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094laughingly he\nlooked at Petrie, and added\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"even when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re wrong.  The little\nceremonies\u00e2\u0080\u0094the respectful servants\u00e2\u0080\u0094the hundred little customs that pad\nyour comfort and nurse your self-respect. Home, eh?\"  The word was like\na minor chord that he wished to dwell upon, so lovingly did he repeat\nit. \"Home, eh?  And I love old London.  I think I am even prepared to\nlike the fogs.\"\n\nAmazed at the change in the man before him, Petrie sat spellbound as Jim\njumped to his feet.\n\n\"Do you know what I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do when I get back?  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll ride a week at a time\non top of the \u00e2\u0080\u0099buses, up and down the Strand, Piccadilly Circus, Regent\nStreet, Oxford Street.  And the crowds!\"  Before his excited eyes came\nthe rush, the very smell of the smoky city with its out-pouring of\nhumanity.  \"How I love the crowds\u00e2\u0080\u0094the endless crowds!  And, Petrie, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\ngo every night to the music-halls, and what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s left of the nights to the\nclubs\u00e2\u0080\u0094and, by Jove, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come into my own at last!\"\n\nCarried away with the enthusiasm that was inspiring Jim, Petrie entered\ninto the spirit of his joy as he cried, \"The king is dead\u00e2\u0080\u0094long live the\nking!\"\n\n\"Into my own at last!  And I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m still young enough to enjoy\nlife\u00e2\u0080\u0094life\u00e2\u0080\u0094_life_!\"  Into Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slender figure, with its arms\nout-stretched to the past, which was to be his future, there leaped the\nfire of immortal youth. It was his moment of supreme exaltation.\n\nSuddenly from the stable door opposite came a glad cry of \"Daddy!\ndaddy!\" as Hal, attracted by the loud voice of Jim, peered from behind\nthe door. Then the child darted across to his father, who still stood\nwith his arms out-stretched to his dream, and clasped his knees.\nFrightened at the stranger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence, Hal quickly buried his face\nagainst his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body.\n\nThe ecstasy faded from Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes as the cry of the child brought him\nback from his dreams to the affairs of earth.  Slowly and with infinite\ntenderness his eyes rested on the bent head of the child.  The twilight,\nwhich is short in the Green River country, had slipped away, and the\nangry sun disappeared behind the mountains.  Petrie noticed the chill in\nthe air that comes at evening on the plains.\n\nThe cry of the child revealed a new phase of the situation.  Silently he\nwatched Jim, whose glance went towards the stable.  He saw the figure of\na beautiful Indian girl emerge, carrying a pail of milk. He saw the\nshudder that passed over Jim as Nat-u-ritch, unconscious that she was\nthe central figure in a tragic moment, moved slowly before them to the\ncabin opposite.  Her master was busy with the white man, so her eyes\nwere lowered; she did not even call to the child to follow her.  Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nglance never left her until the door had closed.  Then his eyes rested\nagain tenderly on the little head which nestled against him, and a sigh\nbroke from his lips.  He stooped and drew the little hand in his as he\nturned the child towards Malcolm Petrie.  The words of his glad dream\nseemed still filling the air as Jim said: \"Petrie, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come too late.\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what would have happened; it can never happen now.\"\n\nGently he urged the child forward as he said; \"Hal, shake hands with Mr.\nPetrie.  This is my son, Petrie.\"\n\n\n\n\n                             *CHAPTER XXII*\n\n\nThe news was not so very surprising to Malcolm Petrie.  In his years of\npractice as a solicitor many similar cases had come to his notice.  He\nhad often remonstrated at the folly of sending the younger son of a\ngreat family to these lands, and at the unwisdom of parents who found\nthe problem of guiding a wayward boy too hard, and so let him go to the\nWest, to be left to the mercy of its desolation and to the temptation of\nsuch entanglements.  But that it would be a new difficulty he foresaw,\nand as he took the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s out-stretched hand he remembered the proud\nwoman waiting at Fort Duchesne.  To him, as a man of the world, the\naffair was understandable, but to Diana!  He began to regret that she\nhad come. There was no suggestion of these thoughts in his manner as he\nkindly said:\n\n\"How do you do, my little man?\"\n\n\"How do you do, Mr. Petrie?\" the child answered, and then ran back to\nhis father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s side.\n\nThe dark head with its faint trace of the Indian blood was extremely\nbeautiful, but Malcolm Petrie noticed a much stronger predominance of\nthe Wynnegate features.\n\nWith his hand on the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head, Jim said, \"You see, Petrie, we have\nto-day and to-morrow\u00e2\u0080\u0094but never yesterday.\"  In the man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice was so\nmuch despair that Petrie found it impossible to understand it.\n\n\"I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t quite follow you,\" he said.\n\nTurning in the direction in which the Indian girl had disappeared, Jim\nanswered, \"That was Hal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mother.\"\n\n\"Indeed!\"  And still Petrie was puzzled at Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attitude.\n\n\"There isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t any place in England for Nat-u-ritch.\"  Then, as Jim bent\nover the boy, he held him close and said, \"Kiss me, dear, and now run in\nand help your mother.\"  Jim followed the boy to the cabin door.\n\nMalcolm Petrie said, tentatively, \"And that Indian squaw\u00e2\u0080\u0094woman, I\nmean\u00e2\u0080\u0094is your\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nBut Jim stopped the word that he felt Petrie was about to speak.\n\n\"My wife,\" he said.  Petrie dropped his glasses and turned sharply to\nJim.  \"My wife,\" Jim said again.  \"You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suppose I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d let my boy come\ninto the world branded with illegitimacy, do you?\"\n\nTo this Petrie gave no answer.  Under Jim almost defiant gaze he found\nit impossible to argue, but there must be a solution to this problem.\nHe moved away as he almost lightly said, \"An awkward situation, Mr.\nCarston\u00e2\u0080\u0094quite an awkward situation,\" but the words conveyed no idea that\nhe felt there was a finality about the matter.  His lawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain would\nunravel the knot.  Jim could still have his freedom.  Then he said, \"But\nthese matters can be arranged.  You will be in a position to settle an\nincome on her which will make her comfortable for life, and some good\nman will eventually marry her.\"\n\nJim almost smiled.  There was so much of the conventional standard in\nPetrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s speech.\n\n\"Wait a bit.  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand.\"  He motioned Petrie to be seated\nagain.  He hesitated, then determined to tell his story.  It might as\nwell be done now; it would save further discussion.\n\n\"I first saw Nat-u-ritch at a bear-dance at the agency.  The Indians\nreverse our custom, and the women ask the men to dance.  Nat-u-ritch\nchose me for her partner.  We met again at Maverick, where she killed a\ndesperado to save my life.\"  These words Jim almost whispered to Petrie,\nwho leaned forward to catch every syllable.  \"The next time I saw\nher\u00e2\u0080\u0094Oh, well, why tell of the months that followed?  One day I found\nmyself lying in her wickyup.  I had been at death\u00e2\u0080\u0099s door fighting a\nfever.  Searching for strayed cattle, I had tumbled into Jackson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hole\nand had been abandoned for dead.  Nat-u-ritch went in alone, on\nsnow-shoes, and dragged me back to her village.  It was a deed no man,\nred or white, would have attempted to do.  When I grew well enough she\nbrought me here to my own ranch, where I had a relapse.  Again she\nnursed me back to life.\"\n\nHe paused.  How should he tell this man of the days of blinding\ntemptation the loneliness of his life had brought with it?  Petrie\nwaited.  Jim moved a little closer to him as he went on:\n\n\"When I grew stronger, I tried my best to induce her to leave the ranch,\nbut she would not go.  She loved me with a devotion not to be reasoned\nwith.  I almost tried to ill-treat her.  It made no difference.\"  Again\nthe despair that Petrie had noticed before crept into Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice.  \"I\nwas a man\u00e2\u0080\u0094a lonely man\u00e2\u0080\u0094and she loved me.  The inevitable happened.  You\nsee, I cannot go back home.\"\n\nNo, this was not the usual case, Malcolm Petrie told himself.  Even he\nhad been impressed by Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recital of the story.  It was this man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nattitude towards the woman that gave him more cause for anxiety than the\nsquaw\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position in the case, so he said:\n\n\"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you think you take rather too serious a view of the case?  You\ncan explain the situation to her and she will be open to reason.\"\n\nBut Jim interrupted him.  \"I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t desert a dog that had been\nfaithful to me.  That wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be English, would it?  The man who tries\nto sneak out of the consequences of his own folly\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\"Believe me,\" the lawyer protested, \"I would advise nothing unbecoming a\ngentleman.  But aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you idealizing Nat-u-ritch a little?\"\n\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s answer was not reassuring.  \"On the contrary, we never do these\nprimitive races justice.  I know the grief of the ordinary woman.  It\ndoesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t prevent her from looking into the mirror to see if her bonnet is\non straight; but Nat-u-ritch would throw herself into the river out\nthere, and I should be her murderer as much as if I pushed her in.\"\n\nThen Petrie devised a new scheme to test Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resolution.\n\n\"Why not take her with you to England?\" he asked.\n\n\"Impossible!\" Jim answered.  \"We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d both be much happier here.  Even here\nI am a squaw man\u00e2\u0080\u0094that means socially ostracized.\"  A bitter laugh broke\nfrom him.  \"You see, we have social distinctions out here.\"\n\n\"How absurd!\"\n\n\"Social distinctions usually are,\" and Jim laid his arm on Petrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  He\nwas growing tired of the discussion.  Petrie felt that Jim wished to\ndismiss it, so he determined to play his trump card.  This sacrifice of\na splendid fellow was madness.  Years from now, Jim would thank him that\nhe had urged him to abandon this life to which he clung with his\nmistaken sense of right.\n\n\"I think I am justified in violating my instructions,\" Petrie began.\n\"You were not to know that Lady Kerhill accompanied me to this country.\"\n\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands tightened on Petrie.  \"Diana here?\"  Furtively he looked\nabout him, as though fearful of seeing her.  \"In America?\"  He waited to\nbe quickly reassured that there was no danger of her coming to the\nranch.\n\n\"I left them at Fort Duchesne\u00e2\u0080\u0094her ladyship and her cousin, Sir John\nApplegate.  I was to bring you there and give you what was intended to\nbe an agreeable surprise\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\"Thank God you did not bring her here.\"\n\nJim moved away, with his hands clinched behind him.  Petrie followed as\nhe urged.  \"She will be disappointed, deeply disappointed; she is still\na young and beautiful woman.\"\n\nIf there was temptation in the words, Jim did not betray it.  Quite\nsimply he said, \"She must be.\"\n\n\"With many admirers, it is only natural that she should marry again.\"\n\nAnd Jim answered, fully aware of the torturing methods used by the man\nwho wished to conquer him, \"It is inevitable.\"\n\nThis time Petrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quiet voice rose in an almost impatient intolerance\nas he questioned, \"And yet you feel\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nBut Jim stopped him.  There was agony in his voice.  \"Petrie, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\ntempt me.  I cannot go.  My decision is made and nothing on earth can\nchange it.\"  He walked towards the house as he felt the sudden need of\ncomfort.  He wanted to feel his boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms about him; that would be his\nsolace.  At the window he saw Hal, and a nod brought the child to him.\n\nAs he watched him, Petrie said, more to himself than to Jim, \"The\nsentimental man occasions more misery in this world than your downright\nbrutally selfish one.\"  To Jim he put the direct question, \"Your\ndecision is final?\"\n\n\"Final.\"\n\n\"Too bad.  Too bad.  You are condemning yourself to a living death.\"\n\n\"Oh no; I have my boy.  Thank God, I have my boy.\"\n\nAnd in those words Petrie knew that the child meant more than all the\nrest of life to Jim.  He knew the type\u00e2\u0080\u0094a type that prevails more\nespecially among Englishmen, perhaps, in whom the need of fatherhood is\nstrongly dominant.  Almost prophetically the lawyer laid his hand on the\nhead of the boy, who was standing on the bench playing with his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nkerchief.  \"The future Earl of Kerhill.\"\n\nJim answered, defiantly, \"My boy is my boy.\"\n\nIf Jim persisted in refusing to accept the position as the head of his\nhouse, then this child was the stake to play for, Petrie decided.\n\n\"Well, think of him\u00e2\u0080\u0094of his future.  He has the right to the education of\na gentleman, to the surroundings of culture and refinement.\"\n\nAs Petrie spoke, his glances took in the shabby little chaps, the feet\nin their worn moccasins, the coarse flannel shirt; and Jim saw the look\nand understood. He almost hurt the boy, so tight was his grasp as he\nlifted him down and held him in his arms.\n\n\"One moment, Mr. Petrie.  I see your drift,\" he savagely answered.  \"But\nyou sha\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it, sir.  You sha\u00e2\u0080\u0099n\u00e2\u0080\u0099t.  I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t listen.\"\n\nBut Petrie now knew that he had touched Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s vulnerable point, and that\nhe was capable of making the sacrifice for the boy.\n\n\"I speak as the trusted friend of your family, as the advocate of your\nchild.\"  He told himself he was justified in asking what he did.\n\n\"Before you came,\" Jim said, \"I was a ruined man\u00e2\u0080\u0094stone broke, as we say\nout here.  I had to begin my life all over again.  But I had Hal, his\nlove and his life to live in day by day, and now you want that, too.  I\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do it.  I know it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s selfish, but life owes me something, and\nthat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all I ask.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t let him go.  I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!\"\n\nBut Malcolm Petrie persisted.  \"You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re responsible for that child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nfuture.  You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want him to grow up to blame you\u00e2\u0080\u0094to look back to his\nyouth and his father with bitterness, perhaps hate.\"\n\nJim, as he held the boy from him and studied the tiny face, cried,\n\"You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never do that, will you, Hal, my boy?\"\n\n\"What, daddy?\"\n\n\"Think badly of your father?\"\n\n\"No, daddy, no,\" and the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arms were thrown about Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shaking\nbody.\n\nPetrie touched Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm quietly.  \"You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re robbing your child of his\nmanifest destiny.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n\"Send the little man home with me.\"\n\nWith eyes almost blinded with emotion, Jim looked into Petrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.\n\"Have you any children, Petrie?\"\n\nThe solicitor shook his head, and in Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words, \"I knew it\u00e2\u0080\u0094I knew it,\"\nhe understood what he meant.\n\nLike a father who sympathizes, yet must be firm in his efforts to\nconvince his son of his wisdom, Petrie spoke.\n\n\"I am thinking of Hal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future, as the friend and adviser of your\nfamily.  I am thinking coldly, perhaps, but, believe me, kindly.\"\n\nJim could not doubt his sincerity.  He buried his head against the\nchild.  \"You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know what a lonely life I led until Hal was born, and\nhow lonely I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be when he is gone.\"\n\nGone!  Could he agree to this separation?  The word frightened him.\n\"Gone!  Oh, my God, no!\"  He could not.\n\nThen Petrie appealed to Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s conscience.  \"You know the trite old\nsaying, \u00e2\u0080\u0099England expects that every man this day shall do his duty.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\"\nSo simply, so seriously did Petrie quote the well-worn phrase, that its\nshaft went home.\n\nDuty!  Duty!  Ah, one might squander control of one\u00e2\u0080\u0099s own destiny, but\nfor another, for the child whom the parent has brought into life\u00e2\u0080\u0094how\nanswer that?  It was the duty of the parent to the child\u00e2\u0080\u0094in that lay the\nwhole definition of the word. He held the tiny face in his hands as he\nwhispered: \"Well, Hal, old chap, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a tough proposition they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve put up\nto your daddy, son.  But what must be must be.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be braver than I\nam, I hope.\"  He forgot that the child could not understand him.  Sobs\nshook him as he held the boy tight against his breast.  Hal sought to\ncomfort his father with soft, loving pats.\n\nJim raised his head.  \"Petrie, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve nailed me to the cross.  He goes\nback with you.\"\n\n\"You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never regret this,\" and Petrie laid his hand on Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder.\n\n\"Ask them to teach him that I did this for his sake; but he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll forget\nme\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see.  Some one else will take my place, and he will learn to\nlove them better than he loves me.\"\n\nPetrie tried to comfort him.  \"No, he shall hold you in his memory\nalways\u00e2\u0080\u0094always.\"\n\nSuddenly Jim remembered.  \"What about his mother?\"\n\n\"If you can make the sacrifice, she must.  They say Indians are stoics.\"\n\n\"I can understand the reason for it, Petrie, man.  It will seem a\nneedless cruelty to her.  She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost as much of a child as Hal.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\ntry\u00e2\u0080\u0094I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll try.\"\n\nHolding Hal by the hand, he walked to the cabin and called:\n\"Nat-u-ritch, Nat-u-ritch, come here, little woman.  I want you.\"\n\n\n\n\n                            *CHAPTER XXIII*\n\n\nNat-u-ritch, with slow impassiveness, obeyed. She came from the house\nwith hardly a glance at the stranger.  She had changed but little; still\nslender and childish in form, motherhood and the past five years seemed\nto have left no mark upon her save, perhaps, for a more marked\nwistfulness of expression, especially when she looked at Jim and the\nboy.  Her life was complete; physical deprivations or disappointments\nmattered little to her.  Taught by Jim the ways of civilization, she\ntried to apply them to her surroundings, but it seemed to her a waste of\nthe golden hours when she might be following her master instead across\nthe plains or playing with her child. It was almost piteous to see how\nshe controlled the instincts of her savage desire for freedom, and in\nher primitive way cared for the little cabin so as to please Jim.\n\nMalcolm Petrie noticed at once the difference between Nat-u-ritch and\nthe other Indian women whom he had seen during the past days, and was\nimpressed by it.\n\nHal, at sight of his mother, quickly responded to her out-stretched\nhand.\n\n\"Nat-u-ritch, this is my te-guin\u00e2\u0080\u0094my friend,\" and Jim indicated Petrie.\nShe inclined her head to the solicitor and said, \"How?\"  As her eyes met\nPetrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shrewd glance an instinctive apprehension caused her to tighten\nher arm about the child.\n\n\"Te-guin\u00e2\u0080\u0094big chief from out yonder\u00e2\u0080\u0094over the big water,\" Jim explained,\nbut her unflinching gaze made it difficult for him to go on.  He\nwhispered to Petrie: \"I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to do it\u00e2\u0080\u0094-I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to do\nit.\"  Then he summoned all his courage, and with a forced smile said,\npleasantly, as though humoring a child, \"Nat-u-ritch, te-guin\u00e2\u0080\u0094big\nchief\u00e2\u0080\u0094come for little Hal.\"\n\nShe flung her arms about the sturdy little fellow, and a sharp\nexclamation was her only answer.\n\n\"Pretty soon make Hal big chief.  Touge wayno\u00e2\u0080\u0094te-guin\u00e2\u0080\u0094good friend\u00e2\u0080\u0094take\nHal long way off.\"  A shudder ran through her.  She began to grasp what\nthe stranger\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence meant.  He was of her boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s race, and\nfor too long she had forgotten, what in the beginning had so often\ntroubled her, that Jim would some day want to return to his own people.\nThis had been her great fear, but his kindness all these years had\nlulled to rest that ache of the early days.\n\nWhile these thoughts tormented her, she could hear Jim still explaining.\n\"Long trail, heap long trail\u00e2\u0080\u0094over mountains, heap big\nmountains\u00e2\u0080\u0094Washington.\"\n\nShe slipped the child to the other side of her, that he might be farther\naway from the silent man who was bringing this woe to her, and her\nclutch grew tighter at the word \"Washington.\"  Jim explained to Petrie,\n\"Washington means a lot to them.\"  Then he came closer to Nat-u-ritch as\nhe said, impressively:\n\n\"Big Father\u00e2\u0080\u0094send for little Hal.  Say make him big chief\u00e2\u0080\u0094te-guin cross\nwide water\u00e2\u0080\u0094heap big boat\u00e2\u0080\u0094Hal see the rising sun.  Pretty soon, some day,\nHal heap wickyup\u00e2\u0080\u0094heap cattle\u00e2\u0080\u0094heap ponies\u00e2\u0080\u0094pretty soon heap big chief.\"\n\nHe waited the result of his words.  He thought to appeal to her pride\nand ambition for the boy; but she only shook her head and gazed at him\nlike an affrighted animal whose young is about to be torn from her.\n\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fortitude began to desert him.  \"She doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t understand.  She\ncan\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094she can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t,\" he almost moaned, as he turned away, while his\nclinched hands and the stiffening of his body showed the strain that was\nproving almost too great for him.  \"This is a hard business, Mr.\nPetrie,\" and Petrie could feel the vibrant emotion of these two victims\nof fate.  As Jim moved a step away, Nat-u-ritch, still holding the boy,\nstarted forward and caught his arm as though to hold him back.  Her mind\nwas in a daze\u00e2\u0080\u0094she could utter no word; but Jim understood the pantomime.\n\n\"She thinks I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m going, too,\" he said, and hastened to explain away her\nanxiety.\n\n\"No, Nat-u-ritch\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jim stay here always with you.\"  Something of her agony\nwas relieved and she loosed her hold on him.  \"Always with you,\" Jim\nrepeated tenderly, looking into the tragic eyes as she eagerly followed\nevery word.  \"Only little Hal.\"\n\nAs Nat-u-ritch fully grasped the meaning of the words, there broke from\nher lips the one English word \"No!\" which rang out on the evening air\nwith a wild, dry sob of protest.  It was the anguished cry of universal\nmotherhood.  The Indian woman sank on her knees, with her arms about the\nboy, her face buried on his breast.  The crouching figure betrayed the\nold savage instinct of the female covering her young from the ruthless\nhand that would snatch it from her.\n\nThis time both men turned away.  A purple gray light fell over the yard,\nthe last traces of the sun\u00e2\u0080\u0099s glory disappeared, and the air grew chilly.\n\nJim was the first to speak.  Kindly, but as a master who must have\nobedience, he said; \"Nat-u-ritch, I have taken counsel.  My heart is\ngood.  My word is wise.  I have spoken.  Go.\"  He gently disengaged the\nboy from her grasp.  Nat-u-ritch looked long into Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, and as she\nmet his immovable determination, without a struggle, and with a calmness\nterrible to see, she released the child.\n\nJim lifted her to her feet.  With her big, stricken eyes still fastened\non him, she stood silent for a moment; then the bent, half-stumbling\nfigure slunk past him. Jim dared not watch Nat-u-ritch, though he could\nhear her heavy breathing and the flapping of her beaded robe against the\nground as she crossed to the stable.  Once Petrie saw her sway, but she\nhad steadied herself before he could reach her.  As she reached the\ncorral she stopped, and, turning, flung out her arms in appeal to Jim;\nbut his back was towards her, the child hidden in his embrace.  Then he\nheard the quick patter of her feet as she fled out into the night\u00e2\u0080\u0094away\nfrom these aliens, back to the hills to abandon herself to her grief.\n\nAs Jim rose he resolved that when the boy had gone he would try to make\nher understand that this sacrifice was forced upon them, that for the\nchild\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake they must both bear it, and in the future she should\nreceive even greater care and comfort from him.\n\n\"This is harder on her than on me, Petrie,\" he said, as he lifted Hal up\non the bench and knelt beside him.\n\n\"Where is she going?\" Petrie asked, as he walked towards the corral\nbehind which she had disappeared.\n\n\"Out into the hills to fight it out alone.  Mr. Petrie, this is going to\nbe hard on the boy, too.  He is a shy little prairie bird and has been a\ngreat pet.\"\n\nHe was thinking that perhaps he could arrange to let Nat-u-ritch have\nthe boy a little longer and keep Petrie with them awhile.  \"It would be\nrough on him to leave us all so suddenly and go away with a perfect\nstranger.  Can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you stay here a week or two to let him get used to\nyou?\" Jim proposed.  \"By that time you will have won his confidence.\"\n\nPetrie answered, \"I am sorry, but that is impossible.  I have overstayed\nmy time some weeks. I left important business interests in London to\nundertake this mission, and I must return at once.\"\n\n\"But,\" Jim pleaded, \"It can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be as bad as that. Well, then, only a\nweek.\"\n\n\"I am sorry, but I have already used up all the time I can spare, in\nfinding you.  If the boy goes with me it must be now.\"  Petrie knew that\nDiana was waiting for Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arrival; he must reach her with the news as\nsoon as possible.  Every hour was of moment to them.  She had been\npersistent in her desire to accompany him, and two days had passed since\nhe left her at Fort Duchesne.  He feared some complication might arise\nfrom her woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s impatience, and as it was, he would not be able to\nleave the ranch before daybreak.  Night was already beginning to close\nin on them.\n\nJim began to realize the wisdom of Petrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision. It would only\nprolong the agony.  He must make it easy for the boy; afterwards\u00e2\u0080\u0094well,\nafterwards\u00e2\u0080\u0094  But he dared not picture the desolation which would be his.\n\n\"Hal, my boy, my darling, I must tell you something. You know you want\nto be a soldier like the ones you saw at Fort Duchesne.  Remember?  With\nthe yellow plumes and tassels and swords and things?\"\n\nThe boy was growing sleepy, but at these words roused himself and\ndelightedly exclaimed, \"Yes, yes!\"\n\n\"Well, Mr. Petrie is going to make you one.\"  Hal looked over in\napproval at their visitor who was to make his dream come true.  \"Only,\"\nJim continued, \"you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wear a fine red coat instead of a blue one, and\nMr. Petrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to make you a big, fine soldier man.  So daddy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ngoing to let you go.  Isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t that fine?\"\n\n\"You, too, daddy?\" the child questioned.\n\n\"No, dear; I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go.  When you go away there\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be nobody but me to\ntake care of little momie.\"\n\n\"I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t go alone,\" Hal protested.\n\n\"Yes, dear, if father wants you to,\" Jim persuaded.\n\nBut the child only cried, \"I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\u00e2\u0080\u0094I won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t!\" as he flung his\narms about his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck.\n\nJim felt it would be useless to argue further now. It was past the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbedtime, so he only said, coaxingly, \"Yes, yes, you will.\"  A scheme to\nhelp the boy to bear the separation began to formulate in his mind.\nThey should take him away while he was asleep, and he would send Big\nBill along with him for a few days if necessary.\n\n\"Now, old man, tell Mr. Petrie good-night.\"\n\nThe child did as he was bid.\n\nQuite hopefully Jim went on talking to him as they crossed to the cabin.\n\"All right.  And now daddy will undress you and hear your prayers, and\nwe\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have our usual romp, and then the sandman will come.\"  Then, as\nthe sleepy child, yawning, drooped his head, Jim lifted him in his arms\nand cried: \"Kiss me, dear.  Oh, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever forget your daddy!\"\n\nSo engrossed was he that he failed to hear in the distance sounds that\ntold that visitors were arriving at the ranch.  But Petrie, who was ever\nalert, had been aware of the first clatter of the horses\u00e2\u0080\u0099 hoofs, and now\nturned in the direction from which came Big Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice, high above all\nthe others, saying:\n\n\"Well, I guess not.  Ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t none of us ever forgot that day at Maverick.\nMy, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be glad to see you!\u00e2\u0080\u0094Mr. Carston,\" he called.\n\nBut it was the triumphant call of \"Jim, Jim!\" that made him turn to see\nDiana.  In it was all the hope that had been buried so long\u00e2\u0080\u0094all the\nloving joy which she meant to lavish on the man whose starved life had\nbeen one long sacrifice for her She had imagined this moment\u00e2\u0080\u0094lived it\nagain and again, and now it was hers.\n\nGracious and beautiful she stood in the dim light, holding out her hands\nin welcome.  Behind her stood Sir John, while Petrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face betrayed the\nsurprise that he felt, although he knew he had been fearing such an\noccurrence.  Jim saw them all.  One hand still kept its hold on the\nchild, who at the voices had hidden behind his father; he raised the\nother to his head.  He simply spoke the name \"Diana.\"\n\n\"Why, Jim, I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t believe you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re glad to see us!\" Diana cried, as he\nmade no attempt to take her hand.\n\n\"Oh yes,\" he answered.  \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m dazed, Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0094dazed.\"  Then he turned in\nappeal to Malcolm Petrie.  \"Petrie?\" he questioned.  It would have been\ntoo cruel if this had taken place with Petrie\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knowledge, but he could\nnot doubt the truth of the solicitor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words.\n\n\"This is as much of a surprise to me as it is to you, Mr. Carston.\"\n\nDiana smiled at Petrie.  She had taken her own way in spite of his and\nSir John\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remonstrance.  But they could not understand her\u00e2\u0080\u0094Jim would.\nWhat did they know of the Fairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Corner\u00e2\u0080\u0094of the long torment she and\nJim had shared?\n\n\"We simply couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t wait any longer, Jim.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve come to take you\nhome\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll come home now, Jim, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?  Come home?\"  And as she\nspoke she meant all that the word implied in its completeness. She was\nsuing Jim to let her give him all that he had desired in the long ago.\n\n\"Home\u00e2\u0080\u0094home,\" Jim repeated.  Was he always to be tortured by what he\nnever could have?  His eyes fell on Hal, who was peering out from behind\nhim. As Diana saw the tiny figure in its strange garments, she\ninvoluntarily exclaimed:\n\n\"Oh, what a dear boy!\"\n\nThe child stared at her.\n\nSmiling, she knelt before him.  \"Whose little boy are you, dear?\" she\nasked.\n\nHal glanced at his father and his look said, \"Shall I go to the strange\nlady?\"  Jim nodded his head. Shyly the child advanced towards her.\n\"Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy,\" he said.\n\nDiana was holding the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands in hers.  At the words she lifted\nher face to Jim and mechanically repeated, \"Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s boy?\"  Then she looked\nfrom the dark head, with its curious foreign beauty, up to the man who\nstood there with blanched face and sorrow-stricken eyes.  Gradually she\nbegan to comprehend the meaning of the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words.  Again she mutely\nquestioned Jim.\n\nHe came to the boy and laid his hands on the little fellow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s head.\n\"Yes, Diana.  My boy\u00e2\u0080\u0094my son.\"\n\nShe had dropped the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands at his first word. She looked about\nher, but everything was dim and ghostly in the dim light.  She felt the\nchild\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand on her sleeve.  She could see only Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes in the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nface inquiringly regarding her.  Above him, Jim still stood, silent and\nconstrained.  Petrie and Sir John, with Big Bill, had left them.  Only a\nmoment did she waver, then with a quick, impetuous cry she caught the\nboy to her heart, and in that cry was expressed all the starved\nmaternity of her barren life.\n\n\n\n\n                             *CHAPTER XXIV*\n\n\nJim and Diana sat late into the night while she listened to the story of\nhis life in the West. Urged by Sir John, it was arranged that she should\nleave the ranch the following day.  Bitter as was her disappointment,\nDiana accepted it without comment. Now her concern was chiefly for the\nboy, and she eagerly awaited Nat-u-ritch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return, hoping she might help\nthe little woman to see the wisdom of making this sacrifice for her\nchild\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advantage.\n\nDown the hills towards midnight Nat-u-ritch stole, an elf-like creature,\nwith her clinking, beaded robe gleaming in the moonlight.  Past the\nmen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dwelling she went, and on to the cabin for a last sight of her\nsleeping boy.  From his spying-ground Bill saw her, but made no effort\nto detain her.  He knew that the arrival of Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kinsmen had caused a\nstrange turmoil in his life, and made him forget that Bud Hardy might\nstill prove a menace to him.  So Bill kept his faithful vigil; but once\nfatigue caught him and he closed his tired eyes for a brief space.  It\nwas just the moment that Kid Clarke, the Sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s watcher, had been\nwaiting for.  Unobserved, he slipped away to follow the trail that\nNat-u-ritch had taken when she fled from the house in the afternoon.\nBud Hardy had cautioned him not to lose sight of the squaw, and to\nreport to him in the early dawn at the cabin.  Like Bill, he saw\nNat-u-ritch make her way to the cabin and saw her return; then, as he\nfelt secure that she was safely out of the way, he lay in the loft near\nthe cabin and waited for Bud.\n\nBut Nat-u-ritch had not succeeded in seeing her child.  As she peered\ninto the windows of the cabin she saw a beautiful woman and another\nstranger seated near Jim.  For a long time she watched him as he talked\nto the woman, who now and then went to the door of the room in which the\nchild lay, and listened as though afraid that their voices might disturb\nthe boy.  The woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s presence became an added complication in the\nimpending tragedy that engulfed Nat-u-ritch.  She longed to creep into\nthe room and kneel beside Jim, to beg to be allowed just to be near him;\nbut she was afraid\u00e2\u0080\u0094afraid of the curious glances of the strangers.\nIntently she watched the woman and saw the look on Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face as he\ntalked long and earnestly to her.  How he had changed!  She remembered\nhim as the young, strong, handsome buck whom she had met at the\nbear-dance.  For the first time she seemed to see the whitened hair, the\ntired, patient eyes, and the marks of sorrow on his face. Once she saw\nhim lean forward and gently argue with the white woman.  She dimly\nunderstood the difference between his attitude towards this woman of his\nown race and to her.  Gradually a new pain was added to the hurt that\ntried her endurance; she could not explain it, but Jim had never looked\nat her like that.  He treated her as he did little Hal, while he\nregarded the woman with him as his equal.  She began to sob piteously,\nlike a child who is suddenly asked to face something it cannot\nunderstand.  It was useless to remain there longer.  Back she hurried to\nthe hills, more desolate than when she started to see her child.\nThrough the long hours that followed she made no effort to reason or to\ncontrol her emotions, but abandoned herself to her grief.\n\nJust before daylight Tabywana crept silently along the road and hid\nbehind the wagon that stood near the house.  He had been following Bud\nHardy, whose early visit to the cabin had aroused his suspicions.\nAlthough Jim had dismissed his advice yesterday, the Chief was\ndetermined to see him again as soon as daylight should come.  He was\nimpatient to disclose to Jim the fear that tormented him for\nNat-u-ritch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s safety.  As he watched for the first faint streaks of\ndawn, from his hiding-place Tabywana saw Bud Hardy emerge from the men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nquarters and steal towards the cabin.  Bud tiptoed about the place, then\ncrossed to the loft and gave three short whistles.  Almost immediately\nKid Clarke appeared and leaned out of the loft door.\n\n\"Well?\" Bud called, as Clarke, dazed, rubbed his sleepy eyes.\n\n\"Nat-u-ritch has disappeared\u00e2\u0080\u0094her trail leads to the hills.  Carston\nhasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been to bed at all.  He went away about half an hour ago.\"\n\nBud glanced quickly about the place.  \"No one in the room, then?\"\n\nKid nodded.\n\n\"All right\u00e2\u0080\u0094come down,\" Bud said.\n\nKid disappeared from the aperture in the loft and Bud went softly into\nthe house.\n\nSilently the Chief slid down under the porch of the cabin.  As Bud came\nout of the house he saw in the Sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand a small thirty-two-caliber\nrevolver which he was smilingly examining.  Before he could pocket the\nweapon Tabywana leaped upon him and clutched the hand that held the gun,\nbut Bud, with a muttered imprecation, deftly threw the hand with the\nrevolver over Tabywana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder, but only to feel an iron fist beat\nhis knuckles.  Involuntarily he loosened his hold and heard Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice\nsay:\n\n\"Put up your gun, Clarke.\"\n\nKid had reached there just at the end of the struggle, and had started\nto pull his revolver to assist Bud.\n\nHolding the captured revolver in his hand, Bill said: \"Why, what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the\nmatter, boys?  I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t allow no gun-play on this ranch\u00e2\u0080\u0094not while I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m\nforeman of it.\"\n\nIn the first faint light of the rising sun the three figures were like\nghostly silhouettes against the gray background.\n\n\"I want that gun,\" Bud replied.\n\n\"How did you come by it?\" Bill demanded.\n\nBefore Bud Hardy could speak, Tabywana grasped Bill by the arm and by\npantomime indicated that Bud had crept into the house and stolen it.\n\nBill turned sternly to Bud.  \"What do you mean by sneakin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 into other\npeoples\u00e2\u0080\u0099 houses at night an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 takin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 their property?  Why\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094as he examined\nthe revolver\u00e2\u0080\u0094-\"this gun belongs to Nat-u-ritch.\"\n\nAlmost savagely Bud interposed: \"Oh, it does, does it?  You heard that,\nClarke?  Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s all I want to know.\"\n\nBill saw that Bud had gained evidence against the little woman.  \"Well,\nit ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t all _I_ want to know. You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to show me, Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have\nto show me why you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re combinin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the trades of burglar an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 sheriff.\"\nThen, with a change in his voice, he said, \"Better sit down and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll\ndiscuss this amicable.\"\n\nBud seated himself near Clarke and Bill; Tabywana remained standing near\nthem, eagerly trying to grasp all that was being said.  Bud was not\naverse to taking Bill into his confidence.  He felt that with Clarke as\na witness to Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s statement he had gained the essential point his case\nneeded.\n\n\"You fellers have guyed me for years about Cash Hawkins\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death, \u00e2\u0080\u0099ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nyou?  Now it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my turn.\"\n\nSo Bud was going to try to make a sensational arrest through Bill, and\nthus win the county over to him and secure another election to the\noffice of sheriff!  Should he call Jim at once, Bill wondered.  He\ndetermined to wait and see if Bud meant to declare his intentions.\n\n[Illustration: \"\u00e2\u0080\u0099YES, DIANA.  MY BOY\u00e2\u0080\u0094\u00e2\u0080\u0094MY SON\u00e2\u0080\u0099\" See page 257]\n\n\"Ancient history that, Bud,\" he said, \"Forgotten long ago.\"\n\nBut Bud answered, \"Not by his friends and relatives about Jansen.\"\n\n\"Oh, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re still looking for somebody to scalp, eh? Better let\nsleeping dogs lie, Bud.\"  Perhaps he could reason the Sheriff out of\nthis scheme; perhaps convince him that it was not a profitable move on\nhis part, and that he would in such case have the other party against\nhim if he ever attempted to use these unfair means.\n\nHis thoughts were interrupted by Bud, who said, with a knowing look at\nClarke, \"You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to hand that gun over to me, Bill.\"\n\n\"Will I?\"\n\nBud rose, and with a certain amount of assumed dignity said, \"I demand\nit in my official capacity.\"  As he moved towards Bill he felt Tabywana\ncreeping behind him.  Irritated, he turned and faced the Indian as he\nsaid, \"Say, we \u00e2\u0080\u0099ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got to take Indians into our confidence, have we?\"\n\nBill, who saw that he might accomplish more if left alone with Bud,\nsaid, kindly: \"Tabywana, get Baco up, will you?  I want him.\"\n\nTabywana knew that he was dismissed, but he trusted Bill, so he only\nmuttered a warning as he started to do his bidding.\n\n\"All right, I can take care of myself, Chief.\"\n\nThen the Indian left him.\n\n\"Come on, Bud, I call you.  You got to show me your hand.\"\n\n\"Well, if I want an election it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to me to make good with Cash\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\noutfit, ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\"\n\n\"So you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re due for a grandstand play, eh?\" was Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s comment.  The way\nevents were shaping themselves worried him.  These rough-shod political\naspirations often led men like Hardy to play to the gallery in order to\nwin a high-handed election.\n\nBud went on, sure that Bill would see the reason of his adventure, \"I\nhave always had the bullet that killed Cash, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been the only\nclew I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever had.\"\n\nDryly, Bill interrupted.  \"It hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t led you very far, Bud.\"\n\nBut Bud did not notice Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remark.  Impressively he said: \"It was a\nthirty-two.  Now no man in this country ever carried a toy like that.\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weapon.\"  Then slowly pointing to the revolver in\nBill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand, he said, \"That gun of Nat-u-ritch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s is a thirty-two.\"\n\nIf this was all the evidence that Bud had, the case was not so serious\nafter all, so, much relieved, Bill said, lightly: \"Bud, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a joke.\nBecause Nat-u-ritch happens to own a thirty-two\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nBud maliciously interposed: \"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be in such a hurry.  The last time I\nwas over to Maverick I happens to ask Nick, the barkeep, for a light,\nand he lets me help myself from a squaw\u00e2\u0080\u0099s beaded match-safe.\"  Bud\ncautiously drew a tiny blue-and-green embroidered bag from his pocket.\n\"\u00e2\u0080\u0099Hello,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says I. \u00e2\u0080\u0099Where did you get that?\u00e2\u0080\u0099  \u00e2\u0080\u0099Oh,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 says he, \u00e2\u0080\u0099I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve had\nthat for years\u00e2\u0080\u0094ever since the day that Cash Hawkins was killed.  Found\nit in front of the side door down there.\u00e2\u0080\u0099  And I bought it of him then\nand there\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094Bud looked straight into Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes as he finished\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"cause I\nrecognized it as one I had tried to buy of Nat-u-ritch.\"\n\nBut even this statement apparently did not startle Bill, who met Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nglance squarely as he said, \"And so you jump at the conclusion that\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\"Nat-u-ritch killed Cash Hawkins.\"  Bud took him up.  \"There ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a\ndoubt about it.  You see that thirty-two is minus just the shot which\nshe done it with.\"\n\nBill paled a little.  So Bud had noticed the missing bullet.  He knew\nthat since her marriage Nat-u-ritch had never carried the revolver.  It\nhad been put away on a shelf to be out of the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way.\n\nBud reached his hand towards Bill.  \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve shown you my hand fair and\nsquare\u00e2\u0080\u0094man to man\u00e2\u0080\u0094now I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll thank you for that gun.\"\n\nBut Bill, who caught sight of Jim coming through the corral, said,\n\"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s up to Mr. Carston, and here he is.\"\n\nBud turned sharply.  He would have preferred to meet Jim some other\ntime, but it was too late to retreat now.\n\nBill went to Jim.  \"Hello,\" he said.  He decided to blurt out the whole\naffair to Jim at once.  He knew then that the squaw would be safe; the\nboss would see to that.  \"Mr. Carston,\" he began, \"our amusin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 little\nfriend over there is a-contemplatin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of arrestin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Nat-u-ritch for the\nkillin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 of Cash Hawkins.\"\n\n\"Oh no; you must be joking,\" Jim said to Bud, too worn out to give vent\nto the anger that began to surge through him.\n\nBill was relieved at the light manner in which Jim seemed to take the\nnews.  \"Well, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what I thought, but he takes himself kind of\nserious.\"\n\nFuriously came Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s next words.  \"Anyway, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve got evidence to arrest\nher.\"\n\nShowing the revolver to Jim, Bill contemptuously added, \"And which said\nSheriff steals out of the house of said trustin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and confidin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 friend.\"\n\nJim stared in amazement at the revolver.  Yes, it was Nat-u-ritch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s.  He\nhad never looked at it since that day at Maverick when her hand had\nsaved him from the cowardly attack of Cash Hawkins.  He did not speak.\n\nBud moved closer to him.  He pointed to Bill. \"And which he said\nbelonged to Nat-u-ritch.\"  Triumphantly he pointed also to Clarke to\nindicate that he had him as a witness.\n\nJim motioned Bill to the house.  \"Put that revolver back where it\nbelongs,\" he said, and Bill obeyed.\n\nBud darted forward as though to stop Bill.  \"I demand the custody of\nthat myself, Mr. Carston.\"\n\n\"Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s understand each other, Sheriff.\"  As he spoke, Jim deliberately\nblocked Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way.  \"Nat-u-ritch is as innocent of wrong as a bird that\nflies.  It wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do to confine her in that dirty little jail in\nJansen.  It would be murder.\"\n\n\"You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a law-abiding citizen, Mr. Carston.  You ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t agoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to resist\nthe law?\"\n\nBut Jim stood firm in front of the cabin door. \"There are cases,\nSheriff, where justice is superior to the law, and the white man\u00e2\u0080\u0099s court\nis a bad place for justice to the Indian.  Fortunately for all of us,\nNat-u-ritch has disappeared.\"\n\nAs Jim spoke, Bud realized that if the Indian woman were there Carston\nwould not be so calm.\n\n\"But you couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t arrest her, Sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0094not while I live.  Bill\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094he turned\nto the foreman, who came out of the house\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not in a mood to discuss\nthis with Sheriff Hardy, and I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to violate the laws of\nhospitality.  But just one word, Sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0094you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve eaten my bread, slept\nunder my roof, and now you sneak into my house to get evidence against\nthe mother of my boy.\"  Jim hesitated, and then as he left them he\nquietly finished, \"Bill, I think you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d better see the Sheriff safely on\nhis way.\"\n\nAnd Bud knew that for the time being he had lost his game.\n\n\n\n\n                             *CHAPTER XXV*\n\n\n\"Carston\u00e2\u0080\u0099s locoed.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plumb crazy.  There can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be a jail for whites\nand a palace for Injins. He don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t suppose he can stop me, does he?\" Bud\nbegan, excitedly.\n\nBill, encouraged by Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mastery of the situation, chaffingly answered:\n\"After you arrest Nat-u-ritch you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never hold office, Bud.  You may\nhold a harp or a coal-shovel.\"  Then he laughed.\n\n\"My!  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099re making a fuss over a squaw,\" said Bud, who could see no\nhumor in Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words.\n\nBut Bill replied, \"Arrestin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 the mother of innocent kids will not be\nconsidered a popular form of amusement around here, Bud.\"\n\n\"Kids?  What\u00e2\u0080\u0099s that got to do with it?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Bill.  \"The kid\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an influential citizen hereabouts.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nour long suit, and there ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t a live thing on the ranch that would let\nyou arrest his rag doll.  You couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get away with it, Bud.\"  And as\nthough it were his final word on the subject, Bill said, conclusively,\n\"Better get elected some easier way.\"\n\nA new idea fermented in Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s brain.  If he failed in his scheme to\nbring to trial the murderer of Cash Hawkins, hundreds of men to whom he\nhad blustered and sworn that he would accomplish the deed would no\nlonger believe in him and he would probably lose the election.  Why not\ntry to gain some compensation if this must be the case?\n\n\"Git our horses ready, Clarke,\" he said and watched his assistant leave\nthe yard.  Slowly Bud hitched his foot on a log, and, as though he were\nabout to confer a favor upon Jim, spoke with condescension. \"Mr. Carston\ntakes this too much to heart, Bill. Perhaps we can come to some\nunderstanding.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s come into some money, ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he?  Of course I might lose this\nmatch-safe crossing Red River.\"  He lovingly fingered the little bag.\nBill drew nearer.  \"And I might\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094Bud continued\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"be made independent of\nthe job of sheriff, if it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s worth the boss\u00e2\u0080\u0099s while.\"  There was no\nmistaking the intention of his words.\n\n\"Bud!\"  For a moment Bill could say no more. In the past he and Bud had\nbeen friends\u00e2\u0080\u0094bar-room friends, it was true\u00e2\u0080\u0094but lately he had begun to\nsuspect much about the Sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s career that was unsavory.  Until\nto-day, however, he had had no proof that Bud could behave like a\nblackguard.  \"Bud,\" he rejoined, \"you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to make me lose my\ntemper, and I \u00e2\u0080\u0099ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t done that for twenty years.\"  As he spoke he raised\nhis foot on the log beside Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and in deliberate imitation of him\nleaned his elbow on his knee while he stared straight into the Sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nface.\n\n\"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be foolish,\" Bud began.  \"I can put you to a lot of trouble, and\nI will.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll arrest these English people and put \u00e2\u0080\u0099em under bond to\nappear as witnesses.  They were at Maverick that day, and I got my posse\nready and waitin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to obey orders.\"  This, he thought, was the final shot\nto bring Bill to his senses.  He waited.\n\nWith a tolerance that did not hide his contempt, Bill spoke.  \"Except\nfor Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s orders, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099d throw you off the place.  Get agoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099, Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0094get\nagoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0094and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t stop to pick flowers.\"\n\nBud knew that Bill was conveying a threat which, he felt, as he watched\nhis face, it were wiser not to disregard. He walked towards the barn,\nstopped, ground his teeth, and looked back at Bill; but the big fellow\nstood motionless and in supreme disgust watched the Sheriff. Bud uttered\na low oath, then hurried down to the corral.\n\nStill, Bill did not move.  He did not hear Diana as she opened the cabin\ndoor and, drinking in the fresh morning air, said, \"I feel as though I\nshould suffocate in there.\"  Her looks told that something more than the\nclose air of the cabin room was stifling her. As she came from under the\nporch she saw the immovable figure of the foreman leaning over the log\nwith his head on his hands, watching several men down the road who were\nmounting horses and preparing to make a start.\n\n\"Oh, Mr.\u00e2\u0080\u0094\" She paused.\n\nBill turned.  He saw she had forgotten his name. \"Bill, miss,\" he said.\n\n\"Mr. Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\nBut Bill interrupted as he raised his hat.  \"Just plain Bill, if you\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t mind\u00e2\u0080\u0094and there ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t anything too good for you at Red Butte ranch,\nlady.\"\n\nImpulsively Diana held out her hand to Bill, who took it.  \"Thank you,\nBill.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s good to feel that I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m among friends, because I feel so\nstrange, so bewildered.\"  She had learned of the foreman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s devotion to\nJim and knew that she could trust him. \"Bill,\" she asked, \"what do they\nmean by \u00e2\u0080\u0099squaw-man\u00e2\u0080\u0099?\"  There was so much she could not say to Jim, so\nmuch that had puzzled her, and she longed to unburden her heart to some\none.  This faithful soul would understand her, and would, perhaps, help\nher to learn more about Jim and the Indian woman, concerning whose fate\nshe was now growing anxious.\n\nBill seated himself.  \"Well, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the name some people give a white man\nwho marries an Indian squaw.\"  Then quickly he added: \"But I want you to\nunderstand, miss, Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s respected in spite of the fact he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a squaw man.\nHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lived that down.\"\n\n\"Of course it was a great surprise to us all at first.\"\n\n\"Natural it would be, miss.  Of course no ordinary white man would have\ndone it.  But you mustn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think any the less of Jim for that, miss.\"\n\nQuickly Diana answered, in sympathetic accord with Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loyalty to his\nmaster: \"I think all the more of him, Bill.  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only another of Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nglorious mistakes.\"  Then again she thought of the woman. \"I wish I\ncould see her.  What is she like?\"\n\nBill could not understand this interest in Nat-u-ritch. \"Just a squaw,\"\nhe said, indifferently.  \"She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got two ideas, and I guess only two\u00e2\u0080\u0094Hal\nand Jim.\"\n\nHe liked the little woman, but he could see where she had been a great\ndisadvantage to Jim.\n\nBut Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice as she said, \"A mother and a wife\u00e2\u0080\u0094that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good deal,\nBill,\" made him realize that perhaps he was not doing the Indian girl\njustice.  He could see the tears in Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes as she spoke. \"And her\nboy goes back home with us.\"\n\nBill rose.  \"Kind of tough on yours truly, lady, bein\u00e2\u0080\u0099 as Hal and me are\nkind of side-partners, but then I got to recollect it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best for the\nkid.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s about the size of it, ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\"  This time it was Bill who\nsolicited comfort from Diana.  The thought of the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leaving them\nhad been a difficult proposition for the boys, and they had discussed it\nlong and excitedly when Jim told them the plan the night before.\n\nDiana understood.  \"It involves a lot of suffering all around, doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nit, Bill?  But it seems to me Nat-u-ritch gets the worst of it.\"\n\nTrue to his opinion of the red race, Bill answered, \"She\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an Injin\u00e2\u0080\u0094used\nto takin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 things as they come,\" and he hardly heard Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words:\n\n\"Poor little savage!\"\n\nThis lady had appealed to him\u00e2\u0080\u0094why shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t he ask her advice?  It was\nall very well for him to have frightened the Sheriff into leaving the\nplace, all very well to appear sanguine and hopeful while the boss stood\nnear him, but in his heart he knew he was afraid.  Something in the\nshifting, malicious look of Bud Hardy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes as he left the place told\nBill that there might still be trouble.  Twisting the rim of his big hat\nnervously, he said:\n\n\"Say, miss, you got a lawyer in your party, \u00e2\u0080\u0099ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\"  Diana turned\nto listen to him.  \"Oh, but pshaw!\" he went on, trying to reassure\nhimself even while he spoke the disquieting words.  \"It \u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never get to\nthe lawyer, cause Jim \u00e2\u0080\u0099ll never let him arrest her\u00e2\u0080\u0094never!\"\n\n\"Arrest her!\" Diana exclaimed, in surprise.\n\nBill explained.  \"Nat-u-ritch.  The Sheriff thinks he can prove she\nkilled Cash Hawkins\u00e2\u0080\u0094that day you were at Maverick.\"\n\nJim had not recalled that incident to Diana last night.  He had told her\nhe owed his life to the Indian girl\u00e2\u0080\u0094how and why he had not explained.\nEagerly she leaned towards Bill as she cautiously said, \"Why did she\nkill him?\"\n\n\"Well, if\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094and Bill dwelled on the word\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"_if_ she killed him, she did it\nto save Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life, and it stands to reason Jim ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to see her\nsuffer for it.\"  Then as he saw a troubled look on Diana\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face he\nregretted the admission of his worries.  \"Say, miss, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m awful glad that\nyou an\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Hal are goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to pull your freight, for there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to be\nmerry hell around here.\"\n\nHe quickly begged her pardon for his involuntary slip, but Diana had\nhardly noticed it.  This would mean new worry for Jim.  Then she\ncomforted herself with the thought that perhaps this kind-hearted soul\nwas exaggerating things.  Surely, if there were cause for anxiety, Jim\nwould have spoken to her about it.\n\n\"Is there nothing that can be done, Bill?\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"Well, is there anything that I can do?\"\n\n\"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see how, except to git away as soon\u00e2\u0080\u0099s you can.\"  And then he told\nher of Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proposition to obtain money from Jim, and that the Sheriff\nwas willing to sell his evidence against the Indian girl.  \"Why,\" he\nadded, \"I \u00e2\u0080\u0099most kicked him off the place; and Bud will fight, you know.\"\n\nBut Diana was only concerned to know whether the Sheriff was safely out\nof the way.  \"You say the Sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone?\"\n\n\"Thank Heaven!\" Bill answered.  \"And, by-the-bye, just to be more\ncantankerous, he threatened to hold up you and your party as witnesses;\nbut that wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be legal, would it?\"  As he remembered the boys he\nadded, chuckling, \"It certainly wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be popular.\"\n\nBefore Diana could reply, Jim interrupted them. Like a restless spirit\nhe had been wandering over the place, from barn to cabin, from Hal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nsleeping-room to the boys\u00e2\u0080\u0099 quarters; accomplishing little and vainly\ntrying to accept the events that had crowded into his life during the\nlast hours.  The Sheriff, he felt sure, could easily be managed, but\nNat-u-ritch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disappearance was causing him anxiety.  He knew it was a\ntrait in the Indian character to hide away and stoically endure its\ngrief in silence.  Every moment he expected her to return.  Stronger\nthan all these thoughts was the desire that Diana should go at once, and\nlittle Hal with her.  This speedy termination would make it easier for\nthem all, he told himself, and then there were matters enough to claim\nhis attention.  So he reasoned as he came from the back of the house,\nwhere he had been brooding over a valise containing the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\nbelongings.  As he saw Diana sitting there deep in conversation with\nBill, he stood amazed at the simple adaptability that made it possible\nfor her to adjust herself to these primitive belongings and people.\nBill was already regarding her as a friend.  Then he remembered that he\nmust see Tabywana to tell him of Nat-u-ritch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s disappearance, and\narrange a plan with him to help her to evade Bud for several days.\n\n\"Bill, I wish you would get Baco.  I have sent for Tabywana, and want\nBaco to interpret for me.\"\n\nBill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s heavy boots creaked down the corral.\n\n\"I hope you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve rested well, Diana,\" Jim said.\n\n\"I haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been to bed, Jim.  I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been trying to think it all out.\"\nShe rose and came to him.  \"Would she be quite impossible at Maudsley\nTowers?\"\n\nJim knew she wanted to take up their conversation where it had stopped\nlast night.  They had discussed the subject already, and he felt the\nfutility of going over the same arguments.  It only tormented him, so he\nanswered, \"Quite.\"\n\nDiana persisted.  \"Couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t she be sent to school for a few years?\"\n\n\"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s too late.  That might have been done when she was a child, but now\nshe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a woman.\"\n\n\"And a mother.\"  Then hurriedly, as though fearful that she would not\nhave the courage to express to Jim all her concern for Nat-u-ritch, she\nsaid, \"Jim, I wonder if we are treating her quite fairly?\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"  And in Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s voice there was a prayer.\n\nDuring the night many thoughts had haunted Diana.  The soft little arms\nthat had clung to her the night before troubled her.  What would their\nloss mean to this child-woman of the woods?  She decided to make one\nmore appeal to Jim and frankly lay before him the conflicting emotions\nthat had torn her since her arrival at the ranch.\n\n\"At first, Jim, I hated everybody, then I pitied you. Now I am thinking\nof her.\"  Jim listened intently. She laid her hand on his arm.\n\"Civilization has bred in people like you and me many needs and\ninterests. But this helpless child-mother has just her child and you,\nand we are taking the child away.  Oh, have you the right to sacrifice\nher even for the child?\"\n\nJim could not argue.  He had made his decision when Petrie wrested from\nhim the concession to let the child go to be prepared for the life he\nhad no right to deny him.\n\n\"I have done the best I know how, Diana,\" he said, simply.  \"We must\nleave the rest to God,\" and Diana knew that the words were the result of\nhis own bitter struggle and she could no longer doubt their wisdom.\n\nShe stood silent.  Jim looked at her.  Of their own love that had\nendured all these years, neither spoke. It was Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moment of greatest\ntemptation.  He longed to say something to her that might express what\nhe felt; but again he conquered himself.\n\n\"Will you take Hal?\" was all he said.  \"I want you to get away before\nthe heat of the day.\"\n\nAnd Diana left him.\n\n\n\n\n                             *CHAPTER XXVI*\n\n\nJim waited anxiously for Tabywana, to enlist his services in protecting\nNat-u-ritch.  Impatient of delay, he started towards the bunk-house.  On\nhis way he met Bill, who informed him that Bud and his men had gone.\nTactfully, Bill avoided any reference to Bud\u00e2\u0080\u0099s last threats, and Jim was\ncomforted with the news of the Sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s departure.  It only remained\nnow for him to send Tabywana in search of Nat-u-ritch.  He found the\nChief and Baco, and in a few words told Tabywana that Nat-u-ritch had\ngone into the hills because he had decided to send the child away, that\nshe was very unhappy, and that he wished him to go to her.  Unmoved, the\nIndian listened, and only at the end of the words that Baco was\ntranslating for him made answer that Jim had spoiled Nat-u-ritch, that\nshe must obey her master, and that he would insist upon her returning at\nonce. But Jim explained that he wished her to remain hidden a little\nlonger, until he was sure that the Sheriff had really left the\nneighboring country, as he was fearful that Bud Hardy meant mischief.\nThrough Baco and Tabywana he would send her food and clothing, he added.\nGradually he made the Chief see that this way was the wisest, and\nTabywana left, breathing vengeance on Bud, and swearing that a war\nshould follow if the Sheriff dared to arrest Nat-u-ritch.\n\nJim found the boys assembled before the cabin on his return, while Bill\nwas directing the hitching of the horses to a wagon that was to carry\nDiana and Hal to Fort Duchesne.\n\n\"Everything ready, Bill?\" he said, bravely.\n\n\"Yes, sir, everything ready.\"\n\nJim called to Hal and Diana, who came from the house.  He picked the boy\nup in his arms and a sudden terror overcame him.  He must be alone a\nmoment, to gain the courage necessary to face this last ordeal.\n\n\"Take him, Bill,\" he said, \"while I go and get his bag,\" and he went\ninto the cabin.\n\nThe foreman nodded.  He held the boy high up in his strong arms while\nthe men crowded around him.  He must try to make it easy for the boss;\nthere must be no tears.  Diana and Sir John, from under the porch where\nthey were standing, watched the men with the child, and during the years\nthat followed it was a memory that often recurred to them.\n\n\"Fellers,\" Bill began, as he enthroned Hal on his shoulder\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"fellers,\nhe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to Duchesne\u00e2\u0080\u0094savvy? Gee whiz, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t I wish I was goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to see\nthe soldiers and flags and drums and brass bands and everything!  Ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t\nhe goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 for a fine time!\"\n\nThe child answered with glee, \"Sure,\" and the men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s laughter rang out at\nthe child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s use of their own mode of expression.\n\nCarrying the bag, Jim came from the house.  \"It won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t hurt anybody to\ncarry his belongings; it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s almost empty.\"\n\nShorty sniffed as he peered into it.  \"\u00e2\u0080\u0099Tain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t very full.\"  Then he\nthrew into it the old jewel-box with the trinket which Jim had given\nhim.  Jim saw and understood.  The men had come for their final\nleave-taking of the boy; they wished to prove that their animosity was\nover, that they recognized that misfortune had come to them through no\nfault of his.\n\n\"Hold on, Shorty.\"  Jim tried to prevent the little fellow from getting\nthe valise, but Shorty took the bag out of his hand as he snapped:\n\n\"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Hal\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trunk, ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t it?\"\n\n\"Yes, but\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"\n\n\"It ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t yourn.\"  Ever aggressive, Shorty finished, \"You don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to\nfight the outfit the day your boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s agoin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 away.\"  And he pushed Jim\naside as he carried the valise over to Grouchy, who was holding up a\nvillainous-looking jack-knife to the child.\n\n\"Say, old man,\" the slow, lumbering ranchman labored, \"you wanted this\nfor a long time.  I wouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t give it to you, \u00e2\u0080\u0099cause I was afraid you\nmight cut yourself, but I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been a-savin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 it for you.  When you get\nbigger, you can make things with it.\"\n\nGrouchy threw the knife into the bag, while Shorty, deeply touched,\nmuttered, \"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the longest speech Grouchy ever pulled off.\"  After\nall, the box with its trinket had been a gift to him; he must give\nsomething to the child that had been his very own.\n\n\"Say,\" he began, \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m in on this; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s admired my saddle for a long\ntime.\"\n\nBut Jim protested, \"Shorty, what on earth is he to do with it?\"\n\nAnd Shorty answered, as he flung his saddle into the wagon.  \"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll bet\nthey \u00e2\u0080\u0099ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t got nothin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to touch it in England.\"\n\nBill approvingly observed, \"That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right; he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a cow-boy and needs a\nreal saddle.\"\n\nQuietly Andy pressed forward and diffidently began, \"Und say\u00e2\u0080\u0094und say\u00e2\u0080\u0094und\nsure\u00e2\u0080\u0094the boy you know\u00e2\u0080\u0094und, by golly, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s got to have something to\nremember old Andy by\u00e2\u0080\u0094fadder or no fadder.\"  As he spoke he drew from his\nbelt his revolver, carefully emptied it, and held it up to Hal, whose\neyes gleamed with joy at this especially desired gift. \"Maybe dot don\u00e2\u0080\u0099d\ntickle him, eh?\"\n\n\"Andy, is that sure for me?\" Hal gasped.\n\n\"Sure,\" Andy said.  \"Und say, old man, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a good one\u00e2\u0080\u0094und say, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the\nbest ever; und, by golly, been a good frient to me, und come in handy\nsome day for you; und you remember old Andy by dot better than\nanything.\"\n\nShorty opened the bag and dropped the revolver in. The German held out\nhis arms and in a trembling voice said, \"Kiss me, you rascal,\" and the\nboy jumped into his arms.\n\nBill, who had been listening and watching the men, was tugging at his\nwaistcoat.  \"And here\u00e2\u0080\u0099s an old watch with a horse-hair chain\u00e2\u0080\u0094he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s had\nhis eye on it for some moons.  He\u00e2\u0080\u0099d \u00e2\u0080\u0099a\u00e2\u0080\u0099 had it before,\" he explained\nconfidentially to Jim, who was trying to prevent Bill from loosening it,\n\"only it belonged to my mother.\"  He knelt down on the ground and opened\nhis arms. \"And now, old man, give me a long hug.  Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t ever forget your\nside-partner.\"  Bill felt he must be careful.  The men were beginning to\nmove away, and surreptitiously to dig their knuckles into eyes that were\nshowing their emotion.\n\nElated and excited by what seemed play to him, Hal said, as he patted\nthe foreman, \"Be good, Bill,\" and the men laughed as Bill answered:\n\n\"Sure I will\u00e2\u0080\u0094sure\u00e2\u0080\u0094sure.\"\n\nThe horses began to stamp impatiently as they grew restive under the\nattack of the flies.  Diana looked at Sir John.  They must start\nshortly, she knew; but who would make Jim realize that the final\nfarewell to the child must be spoken.  Petrie, who through a feeling of\ndelicacy had kept away from Jim and the boy all morning, came to Sir\nJohn and Diana with a whispered message from the driver, who was anxious\nto make a start.\n\nAs though divining their thoughts, Jim went to Bill, who was still\nholding Hal.  He threw his arm around the big fellow\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder.\n\"Aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you goin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to drive to the fort, Bill?\"\n\n\"No, I think you need me more than he does.\"\n\n\"Oh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be all right.\"\n\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes searched the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.  For the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sake he must\ncontrol the aching sense of desolation that beset him.\n\nThe cow-punchers silently made their way up to the wagon and began\nadjusting its contents.  No one noticed the dark, tragic face of\nNat-u-ritch peering out of the loft door down at the child and the\nstrangers that stood prepared to carry him away.  Returning a short time\nbefore from her hiding-place by another trail, she had eluded her\nfather, and crept into the barn while the men were absorbed in bestowing\ntheir farewell gifts on the child.  Hidden among the bales of straw, she\nlooked down on the scene.  In her eyes was an almost fanatical calm, so\nstoically did she watch the child.  She seemed in some dumb way to have\nreached a solution of her problem, but in conquering herself she had\npaid heavily, and this abnormal expression of hopeless resignation which\nher eyes held betrayed a terrible possibility.\n\nBill waited for Jim to speak.  As he held the dark little face between\nhis hands, Jim softly whispered, \"I wish his mother could see him once\nbefore he goes; but nothing would ever reconcile her to it, I suppose.\n\n\"It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a heap sight better for her as it is,\" Bill brusquely said.  \"I\ntold Charley to drive like hell; the quicker they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re out of sight the\nbetter.\"  Bill turned to the porch, where Sir John Applegate, Malcolm\nPetrie, and Diana stood, and his glance told them that they must end the\nstrain and get away at once.\n\n\"Well, Jim,\" Sir John said, \"our horses are tied to the corral;\neverything is ready.\"  He took Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand in both of his.  \"Good-bye,\nJim; sorry you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going with us.\"\n\n\"Good-bye, John,\" was all that Jim said.\n\nJim was conscious that the last moments he had dreaded were becoming a\ntragic reality.  There stood Diana ready to start on her journey; on the\nother side of him Petrie advanced with out-stretched hand; while at the\nback of the yard he could see the boys clustered around the wagon\nwaiting for the final moment.  He realized that the sun was rising\nhigher and higher in the heavens and that it was growing hotter.  He\nmust send them away.  A strange veil, that dimmed all about him, seemed\nto hang between him and his surroundings.  Finally he turned to Petrie,\nwho stood on the other side of Bill.  \"Good-bye, Mr. Petrie.\"  Jim held\nhis hand out to the lawyer, in front of the child, and in a low voice\nsaid, \"You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve won your case against me; see that my boy gets all that is\ncoming to him.\"\n\nPetrie gravely answered, \"You may trust me, sir.\"  Then he joined the\nothers at the wagon.\n\nJim stretched out his hands in silence to the boy. The child jumped from\nBill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shoulder and nestled against his father.  Bill left them; only\nDiana remained near Jim.\n\n\"And now, old man, kiss your daddy.\"\n\nA troubled look crept over the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.  It had all been great fun,\nbut now\u00e2\u0080\u0094he was growing frightened. His hold tightened around his\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s neck. Jim quickly saw that he must divert the boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mind.\n\n\"Take good care of Cousin Diana, won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you?\"\n\nAt this appeal the child, who was a masterful little fellow, used to\nbeing treated as an equal by the men on the ranch, answered, \"Sure.\"\nAnd as Diana came to him he leaned down, smiled, and said, \"I like you.\"\n\nDiana smiled as she kissed him, and said, \"And I love you, God bless\nyou!\"\n\nShe could scarcely bear the look of pain in Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes as they went from\nthe boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face to hers, then back again to the boy.  In silence they\ngrasped each other\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hands, then Diana walked over to Bill, who tenderly\nhelped her into the wagon.\n\nJim was alone with his boy.  There was much that he wished to say, but\nhe dare not speak.  He could see the wistful look beginning to return to\nthe child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face.\n\n\"Good,\" he said, lightly.  \"And now be off.\"  Close he pressed the\nchild\u00e2\u0080\u0099s face to his lips.  \"There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a brave boy\u00e2\u0080\u0094with a smile and\nhurrah!\"\n\nHow could he place the child in the wagon beside the waiting woman,\nwhose face was turned away to hide her pain!  His voice dropped low and\nalmost broke.  \"Some day, when you have a son of your own, you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll know\nwhat this means,\" they heard him whisper.  \"But no Wynnegate ever was a\nquitter, and so we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll take things as they come.\"\n\nStill no one turned to him.  Diana felt the child being lifted in beside\nher and the baby fingers fasten around hers.  She turned her face to\nJim, but almost savagely he called:\n\n\"Drive on, and never look back.\"\n\nAnd Charley, who had remembered Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s words \"to drive like hell,\" with\na crack and a slap let the impatient animals go.  The men started after\nthe wagon.\n\n\"Give \u00e2\u0080\u0099em a cheer, boys,\" Jim cried, and the place rang with their\nshouts.\n\nPetrie and Sir John galloped alongside the wagon, with Grouchy, Andy,\nShorty, and Bill following as fast as they could run.  Cheer after cheer\nsent back its echo, while Jim stood alone listening as he watched the\nswaying, rumbling cart raise its cloud of dust, through which he could\nbarely see the men still running and hear the faint echoes of their\ncries of \"Good-bye, Hal.\"\n\nLike a symbol of broken hope, he stood, a solitary figure in the dreary,\ndeserted place.  His hands were still out-stretched towards the receding\nwagon.  The deep-tinted, rose-colored rocks glowed more and more\nradiantly, until the blinding glare from the plains made Jim shield his\neyes.\n\n\"There they go\"\u00e2\u0080\u0094he strained forward closer to watch the wagon\u00e2\u0080\u0094\"down into\nthe ravine\u00e2\u0080\u0094out of sight\u00e2\u0080\u0094and out of my life forever.\"\n\nAs the dip in the land engulfed and shut out his last glimpse of the\ntravellers, he dropped inert and clinched his arms over his head, while\nhis heavy, dragging steps were the only sounds that broke the terrible\nstillness that had fallen over the yard. Almost mechanically he reached\nthe bench and sank down upon it.  Nat-u-ritch, from her hiding-place\nabove, could hear the sobs that came from the crushed and broken man.\n\n\n\n\n                            *CHAPTER XXVII*\n\n\nNat-u-ritch stole down from the loft and crept to where Jim had stood.\nUnconsciously she repeated the same picture of desolation he had made as\nhe stretched out his arms and strained his eyes to see the wagon\ndisappear down the ravine, which the Indian girl could now see far off,\nlike an ant on a hill, as it crawled up the dun-colored mound.  Like\nhim, she folded her arms and stared ahead for a long time\u00e2\u0080\u0094even though\nthe blinding light blurred and made the landscape a chaotic meeting of\nsky and earth.\n\nBut, unlike him, no sobs shook her tiny body; erect and resolute she\nstood, then turned and noiselessly came down behind the weeping man.  In\nwondering pity she watched him, then crossed to the house and entered\nit.  She quickly returned with the small revolver in her hand; but her\nsoft-shod feet made no sound, and Jim, unconscious of her presence,\nstill sat with his head on his knees.  As she caught sight of the tiny\nmoccasins the child had left lying on the bench, she wavered a moment,\nbut she only paused to pick them up and press them against her wildly\nbeating heart.  She had but one thought\u00e2\u0080\u0094escape from the pain that gnawed\nand tormented her.\n\nWithout the boy, and with the look she feared she must face daily in\nJim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes, she knew she could not endure life.  There was no rebellion,\nonly acceptance of her fate, as she crept close behind Jim, the\nmoccasins covering the steel weapon.  Worn out, Jim still remained with\nhead bowed, a physical stupor of fatigue almost dulling his sorrow.\nNat-u-ritch\u00e2\u0080\u0099s quick ear heard the voices of the returning men, and she\ndarted across to the corral and disappeared behind the barn.  But even\nthat did not arouse Jim.\n\nShorty, Andy, and Grouchy hurried after Bill, who was coming back to\nlook after Jim.  Shorty grasped Bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s arm, wheeled him about, and\npointed in the direction the carriage had taken.\n\n\"What are they bringing them back for, Bill?\" he asked.\n\nBill swore a mighty oath as he saw the wagon headed for the cabin, with\nBud and his posse surrounding it.  He must prevent a meeting between Jim\nand Bud if possible.\n\n\"Don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t say a word,\" he whispered to the boys as he caught sight of Jim.\n\"We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll get him into the house.\"\n\nHe came down to Jim and tenderly laid his hand on his shoulder.  \"Jim,\nold man, you haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t had any sleep; go in and rest awhile.\"\n\nJim looked up at Bill, who pulled him to his feet, then started to lead\nhim towards the cabin.  He could fight the physical weariness no longer.\n\n\"Oh, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll be all right soon, Bill.\"\n\nBill, as though humoring a child, said: \"Sure. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve all got to get kind\nof used to it.  Sleep\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the thing to put you right.\"\n\nThey reached the cabin door.  Jim dully echoed, \"Sleep\u00e2\u0080\u0094sure, sleep,\nBill.\"  Then Bill closed the door on him.\n\n\"Shorty,\" he called, \"you and Grouchy stand outside of that door, and\ndon\u00e2\u0080\u0099t you let him out of there until we can get Bud Hardy away.\"  He\nmeant to hurry and meet the wagon before it could reach the yard, but as\nhe spoke he heard the men and horses and knew that it was useless.\n\nAndy, who had been watching farther down the road, ran towards him.\n\"Bill,\" he called, \"Bud Hardy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s here.\"  As he spoke, Bud and his men\nadvanced, followed by Diana and the child, while Sir John and Petrie\nstood close to them.\n\n\"Bud,\" Bill began, in a quick, low voice, \"Jim ain\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in any mood to be\ntrifled with to-day.  What in hell do you mean by stopping these people\nwhen I ordered you off the place?\"  He blurted out the words as though\nfearful of the impulse that drove him to do bodily harm to the Sheriff.\n\nWith a sneer Bud answered, \"I told you I would hold these people as\nwitnesses, and now I want Nat-u-ritch.\"\n\nBefore Bill could remonstrate, there was a hoarse cry from the house.\nThey heard Jim wildly saying, as he rushed to Bill:\n\n\"Where is it?  Where is it?  It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gone\u00e2\u0080\u0094gone!  Who took it?  Bill, did\nyou put that little gun back in the room as I told you?\"\n\n\"That I did, boss.\"\n\nAs Jim stood in the yard he failed to see Diana or the child.  He saw\nonly the great form of the Sheriff, with his men around him, and he knew\nthat mischief was afoot.\n\n\"You here, damn you!\"  He made a movement to reach Bud, but was\nrestrained by Shorty and Grouchy.  Then he saw that the entire party had\nbeen taken into custody.  Before he could expostulate, a shot rang out.\n\n\"What was that!\"\n\nBill ran to the barn.  Jim followed him, but was stopped at the door by\nBill.\n\n\"Jim,\" he cried, \"it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Nat-u-ritch.\"\n\nBefore either of them could reach the tiny form they saw Tabywana lean\nover and pick up the child-woman in his arms.  He had found her, but too\nlate.\n\nDiana, holding the child and followed by Petrie and Sir John, drew back\ninto the corner of the porch. Bud and his men, who had lost their prey,\nslunk away.  Only his faithful men stood by Jim as Tabywana advanced,\ncarrying in his arms the dead Nat-u-ritch.  From her hands dangled the\ntiny baby shoes.\n\nTabywana held out the lifeless body to Jim.  In death as in life, she\nbelonged to her master.\n\n\"Poor little mother!  Poor little mother!\" Jim whispered.\n\n\n\n\n                            *CHAPTER XXVIII*\n\n\nThe fields were golden-tipped with mustard-flower, while a haze as\ngolden touched and glinted the green of the encircling hills.  A riot of\nvernal glory met Jim\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eyes as he walked through the lanes that led to\nthe Towers.\n\nSix months had passed since Diana and Hal had left him, and until now\nthe West with its memories had held him.  He had written that he would\nbe with them on this day, but he wished to return quietly. Only Diana\nand the child knew of his expected arrival.\n\nThe soft summer heat had brought into blossom every wild flower in glen\nand roadway; the great trees seemed heavy with the fragrant breezes that\nwafted through their leaves.  As he had gone from home, so he wished to\nreturn to it\u00e2\u0080\u0094alone.  A tumult of emotions battled within him as he\napproached the entrance to the Towers.  He found the heavy doors opened\nwide as though expectant of a visitor.  As he stood on the threshold the\nclock of the church-tower struck twelve.  It was noon\u00e2\u0080\u0094the high noon of\nhis life.\n\nFrom the hall he heard a voice cry, \"Welcome home, daddy!\"\n\nHe turned to see his boy, changed even during the short separation\u00e2\u0080\u0094but\nstronger, more beautiful, a veritable princeling\u00e2\u0080\u0094holding out his eager\nlittle arms. And his boy, standing alone in the great hallway of the\nhome of their ancestors, welcomed Jim to his own. As he held the child\nclose to him, his eyes searched for Diana, and as the boy rained kisses\non his face, Jim said:\n\n\"Cousin Di\u00e2\u0080\u0094where is she?\"\n\nThe child smiled, and, slipping down to the ground, took hold of his\nfather\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand and started to draw him down the corridor that led to the\ngarden.\n\n\"Cousin Di is waiting for you in the Fairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Corner,\" said the child.\n\"We go there to play, you know, and listen for the fairies.\"\n\nJim did not speak, but the child prattled on as he led him across the\ngreen grass, past the swaying, flaunting hollyhocks and the beds of\nold-fashioned, fragrant flowers that lined the walks.  The songs of\nbirds filled the air\u00e2\u0080\u0094linnet, lark, and thrush seemed carolling a welcome\nto him.  But Jim hardly heard what the boy said.  He could see only the\nwaving tree-tops of the mysterious Corner in the distance.\n\n\"Cousin Di!\" the child called, as he ran ahead to herald his father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\ncoming.\n\nBeyond, the path and garden were bathed in strong sunlight; the heavens\nwere full of drifting azure clouds. Over all was the dazzling,\nbewildering glory of the noonday splendor, and before Jim stood Diana, a\ngracious figure, at the entrance to the enchanted spot. On her face a\ntender love answered all that his eyes asked.  Behind her he could see\ndeep into the Fairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Corner; in there all was peaceful; only golden\ncobwebs of sunlight dappled the leaves and scattered the enshrouding\ngloom.\n\nNeither Jim nor Diana spoke.  The boy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attention was claimed by a\nvivacious wag-tail that chirruped at his feet, then fluttered away to be\npursued by him. Once he turned to smile back a reassurance of his joy at\nhis father\u00e2\u0080\u0099s return, but he could not see him.\n\nDiana and Jim had entered the Fairies\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Corner, and this time they heard\nthe flutter of wings\u00e2\u0080\u0094the wings of their love as it enfolded them in its\npeace and holy joy.\n\n\n\n                                THE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE SQUAW MAN ***\n\n\n\n\nA Word from Project Gutenberg\n\n\nWe will update this book if we find any errors.\n\nThis book can be found under: http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/ebooks\/52804\n\nCreating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright\nlaw means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so\nthe Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United\nStates without permission and without paying copyright royalties.\nSpecial rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this\nlicense, apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 electronic\nworks to protect the Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 concept and trademark.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2\n\n\nProject Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goals\nand ensuring that the Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 collection will remain freely\navailable for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and\npermanent future for Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 and future generations. To learn\nmore about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how\nyour efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the\nFoundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org .\n\n\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation\n\n\nProject Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread\npublic support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the\nnumber of public domain and licensed works that can be freely\ndistributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of\nequipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to\n$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with\nthe IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where\nwe have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND\nDONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state\nvisit http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside\nthe United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways\nincluding checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate,\nplease visit: http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/fundraising\/donate\n\n\nSection 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 electronic\nworks.\n\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2 eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in\nthe U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not\nnecessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\u00e2\u0080\u0099s eBook\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\nthe old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n    http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg\u00e2\u0084\u00a2, including\nhow to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to\nour email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1275,"split":"test"}
