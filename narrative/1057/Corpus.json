{"ori_id":"f4743bff03d90a9fde6068197d2552bd5897baa1","title":"Poor Miss Finch","context":"Poor Miss Finch\n Twenty-one-year-old Lucilla Finch, the independently wealthy daughter of the rector of Dimchurch, Sussex, has been blind since infancy. Shortly after the narrator, Madame Pratolungo, arrives to serve as her paid companion, Lucilla falls in love with Oscar Dubourg, her shy and reclusive neighbour, also wealthy, who devotes himself to craftsmanship in precious metals.\nAfter being attacked and knocked unconscious by robbers, Oscar is nursed by Lucilla and falls in love with her, and the couple become engaged. Their plans are jeopardized by Oscar's epilepsy, a result of the blow to his head. The only effective treatment, a silver compound, has the side-effect of turning his skin a permanent, dark blue-grey. Despite her blindness, Lucilla suffers a violent phobia of dark colours, including dark-complexioned people, and family and friends conceal Oscar's condition from her.\nMeanwhile, Oscar's twin brother, Nugent, returns from America, where he has dissipated his fortune pursuing a career as a painter. Oscar is devoted to his brother, who is as outgoing, confident and charming as Oscar is diffident and awkward. Knowing of Lucilla's blindness, Nugent has arranged for her to be examined by a famous German oculist, Herr Grosse. Herr Grosse and an English oculist each examine Lucilla but disagree on her prognosis. Lucilla elects to be operated on by Herr Grosse, who believes he can cure her. After the operation, but before the bandages are taken off, Madame Pratolungo pressures Oscar into telling Lucilla of his disfigurement, but his nerve fails and, instead, he tells her it is Nugent who has been disfigured.\nNugent is secretly infatuated with Lucilla and now manipulates her into believing that he is Oscar. As Lucilla gradually regains her sight, Herr Grosse forbids family and friends from undeceiving her, since the shock might imperil her recovery. Oscar goes abroad, resigning his fiancee to his brother in despair. Madame Pratolungo intervenes decisively with Nugent, appealing to his conscience and threatening him with exposure if he continues with his plan to marry Lucilla under Oscar's name. He promises to go abroad to find his brother and return him home.\nNugent soon returns to England and tracks Lucilla to the seaside, where, on Herr Grosse's orders, she is staying with her aunt, away from her immediate family. He pressures her to marry as soon as possible, without her family's knowledge, and works to poison her trust in Madame Pratolungo, who is away in Marseilles attending to her wayward father. Detecting but not understanding the change in her supposed fiance, Lucilla becomes distraught, over-strains her eyes and begins to lose her vision.\nIn the novel's denouement, Madame Pratolungo locates Oscar with the help of a French detective. His experiences have revealed an unexpected strength of character, and she conceives a new respect for him. The two of them race home to England to stop the marriage while there is still time. Held virtually prisoner at a Dubourg cousin's house, Lucilla is again totally blind. With the help of a kindly servant, she escapes to meet them, immediately recognizes the true Oscar, and is told the full story by Madame Pratolungo. A penitent Nugent returns to America, where he later dies on a polar expedition. Lucilla and Oscar settle in Dimchurch to raise a family, with Madame Pratolungo as her companion. Perfectly content in her blindness, she refuses Herr Grosse's offers to attempt another operation.\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfThe Project Gutenberg EBook of Poor Miss Finch, by Wilkie Collins\n\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.

ELLIOT,\n\n(OF THE DEANERY, BRISTOL).\n\nWILL YOU honor me by accepting the Dedication of this book, in\nremembrance of an uninterrupted friendship of many years?\n\nMore than one charming blind girl, in fiction and in the drama, has\npreceded \"Poor Miss Finch.\" But, so far as I know, blindness in these\ncases has been always exhibited, more or less exclusively, from the ideal\nand the sentimental point of view. The attempt here made is to appeal to\nan interest of another kind, by exhibiting blindness as it really is. I\nhave carefully gathered the information necessary to the execution of\nthis purpose from competent authorities of all sorts. Whenever \"Lucilla\"\nacts or speaks in these pages, with reference to her blindness, she is\ndoing or saying what persons afflicted as she is have done or said before\nher. Of the other features which I have added to produce and sustain\ninterest in this central personage of my story, it does not become me to\nspeak. It is for my readers to say if \"Lucilla\" has found her way to\ntheir sympathies. In this character, and more especially again in the\ncharacters of \"Nugent Dubourg\" and \"Madame Pratolungo,\" I have tried to\npresent human nature in its inherent inconsistencies and\nself-contradictions--in its intricate mixture of good and evil, of great\nand small--as I see it in the world about me. But the faculty of\nobserving character is so rare, the curiously mistaken tendency to look\nfor logical consistency in human motives and human actions is so general,\nthat I may possibly find the execution of this part of my task\nmisunderstood--sometimes even resented--in certain quarters. However,\nTime has stood my friend in relation to other characters of mine in other\nbooks--and who can say that Time may not help me again here? Perhaps, one\nof these days, I may be able to make use of some of the many interesting\nstories of events that have really happened, which have been placed in my\nhands by persons who could speak as witnesses to the truth of the\nnarrative. Thus far, I have not ventured to disturb the repose of these\nmanuscripts in the locked drawer allotted to them. The true incidents are\nso \"far-fetched\"; and the conduct of the real people is so \"grossly\nimprobable\"!\n\nAs for the object which I have had in view in writing this story, it is,\nI hope, plain enough to speak for itself. I subscribe to the article of\nbelief which declares, that the conditions of human happiness are\nindependent of bodily affliction, and that it is even possible for bodily\naffliction itself to take its place among the ingredients of happiness.\nThese are the views which \"Poor Miss Finch\" is intended to advocate--and\nthis is the impression which I hope to leave on the mind of the reader\nwhen the book is closed.\n\nW. C.\n\nJanuary 16th, 1872.\n\n\n\nNOTE TO THE PRESENT EDITION.\n\nIN expressing my acknowledgments for the favorable reception accorded to\nthe previous editions of this story, I may take the present opportunity\nof adverting to one of the characters, not alluded to in the Letter of\nDedication. The German oculist--\"Herr Grosse\"--has impressed himself so\nstrongly as a real personage on the minds of some of my readers afflicted\nwith blindness, or suffering from diseases of the eye, that I have\nreceived several written applications requesting me to communicate his\npresent address to patients desirous of consulting him! Sincerely\nappreciating the testimony thus rendered to the truth of this little\nstudy of character, I have been obliged to acknowledge to my\ncorrespondents--and I may as well repeat it here--that Herr Grosse has no\n(individual) living prototype. Like the other Persons of the Drama, in\nthis book and in the books which have preceded it, he is drawn from my\ngeneral observation of humanity. I have always considered it to be a\nmistake in Art to limit the delineation of character in fiction to a\nliterary portrait taken from any one \"sitter.\" The result of this process\nis generally (to my mind) to produce a caricature instead of a character.\n\nNovember 27th, 1872\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\nCHAPTER\n\nFIRST  Madame Pratolungo presents Herself\nSECOND  Madame Pratolungo makes a Voyage on Land\nTHIRD  Poor Miss Finch\nFOURTH  Twilight View of the Man\nFIFTH  Candlelight View of the Man\nSIXTH  A Cage of Finches\nSEVENTH  Daylight View of the Man\nEIGHTH  The Perjury of the Clock\nNINTH  The Hero of the Trial\nTENTH  First Appearance of Jicks\nELEVENTH  Blind Love\nTWELFTH  Mr. Finch smells Money\nTHIRTEENTH  Second Appearance of Jicks\nFOURTEENTH  Discoveries at Browndown\nFIFTEENTH  Events at the Bedside\nSIXTEENTH  First Result of the Robbery\nSEVENTEENTH  The Doctor's Opinion\nEIGHTEENTH  Family Troubles\nNINETEENTH  Second Result of the Robbery\nTWENTIETH  Good Papa again!\nTWENTY-FIRST  Madame Pratolungo Returns to Dimchurch\nTWENTY-SECOND  The Twin-Brother's Letter\nTWENTY-THIRD  He sets us All Right\nTWENTY-FOURTH  He sees Lucilla\nTWENTY-FIFTH  Nugent puzzles Madame Pratolungo\nTWENTY-SIXTH  He proves Equal to the Occasion\nTWENTY-SEVENTH  He finds a Way out of it\nTWENTY-EIGHTH  He crosses the Rubicon\nTWENTY-NINTH  Parliamentary Summary\nTHIRTIETH  Herr Grosse\nTHIRTY-FIRST  \"Who Shall Decide when Doctors disagree?\"\nTHIRTY-SECOND  Alas for the Marriage!\nTHIRTY-THIRD  The Day Between\nTHIRTY-FOURTH  Nugent shows his Hand\nTHIRTY-FIFTH  Lucilla tries her Sight\nTHIRTY-SIXTH  The Brothers Meet\nTHIRTY-SEVENTH  The Brothers change Places\nTHIRTY-EIGHTH  Is there no Excuse for Him?\nTHIRTY-NINTH  She Learns to See\nFORTIETH  Traces of Nugent\nFORTY-FIRST  A Hard Time for Madame Pratolungo\nFORTY-SECOND  The Story of Lucilla: told by Herself\nFORTY-THIRD  Lucilla's Journal, continued\nFORTY-FOURTH  Lucilla's Journal, continued\nFORTY-FIFTH  Lucilla's Journal, concluded\nFORTY-SIXTH  The Italian Steamer\nFORTY-SEVENTH  On the Way to the End.

I am the\ncurious foreign woman. And I take it on myself--for reasons which will\npresently appear--to tell the story.\n\nSo far we understand each other. Good. I may make myself known to you as\nbriefly as I can.\n\nI am Madame Pratolungo--widow of that celebrated South American patriot,\nDoctor Pratolungo. I am French by birth. Before I married the Doctor, I\nwent through many vicissitudes in my own country. They ended in leaving\nme (at an age which is of no consequence to anybody) with some experience\nof the world; with a cultivated musical talent on the pianoforte; and\nwith a comfortable little fortune unexpectedly bequeathed to me by a\nrelative of my dear dead mother (which fortune I shared with good Papa\nand with my younger sisters). To these qualifications I added another,\nthe most precious of all, when I married the Doctor; namely--a strong\ninfusion of ultra-liberal principles. _Vive la R\u00c3\u00a9publique!_\n\nSome people do one thing, and some do another, in the way of celebrating\nthe event of their marriage. Having become man and wife, Doctor\nPratolungo and I took ship to Central America--and devoted our\nhoney-moon, in those disturbed districts, to the sacred duty of\ndestroying tyrants.\n\nAh! the vital air of my noble husband was the air of revolutions. From\nhis youth upwards he had followed the glorious profession of Patriot.\nWherever the people of the Southern New World rose and declared their\nindependence--and, in my time, that fervent population did nothing\nelse--there was the Doctor self-devoted on the altar of his adopted\ncountry. He had been fifteen times exiled, and condemned to death in his\nabsence, when I met with him in Paris--the picture of heroic poverty,\nwith a brown complexion and one lame leg. Who could avoid falling in love\nwith such a man? I was proud when he proposed to devote me on the altar\nof his adopted country, as well as himself--me, and my money. For, alas!\neverything is expensive in this world; including the destruction of\ntyrants and the saving of Freedom. All my money went in helping the\nsacred cause of the people. Dictators and filibusters flourished in spite\nof us. Before we had been a year married, the Doctor had to fly (for the\nsixteenth time) to escape being tried for his life. My husband condemned\nto death in his absence; and I with my pockets empty. This is how the\nRepublic rewarded us. And yet, I love the Republic. Ah, you\nmonarchy-people, sitting fat and contented under tyrants, respect that!\n\nThis time, we took refuge in England. The affairs of Central America went\non without us.\n\nI thought of giving lessons in music. But my glorious husband could not\nspare me away from him. I suppose we should have starved, and made a sad\nlittle paragraph in the English newspapers--if the end had not come in\nanother way. My poor Pratolungo was in truth worn out. He sank under his\nsixteenth exile. I was left a widow--with nothing but the inheritance of\nmy husband's noble sentiments to console me.\n\nI went back for awhile to good Papa and my sisters in Paris. But it was\nnot in my nature to remain and be a burden on them at home. I returned\nagain to London, with recommendations: and encountered inconceivable\ndisasters in the effort to earn a living honorably. Of all the wealth\nabout me--the prodigal, insolent, ostentatious wealth--none fell to my\nshare. What right has anybody to be rich? I defy you, whoever you may be,\nto prove that anybody has a right to be rich.\n\nWithout dwelling on my disasters, let it be enough to say that I got up\none morning, with three pounds, seven shillings, and fourpence in my\npurse; with my fervid temper, and my republican principles--and with\nabsolutely nothing in prospect, that is to say with not a halfpenny more\nto come to me, unless I could earn it for myself.\n\nIn this sad case, what does an honest woman who is bent on winning her\nown independence by her own work, do? She takes three and sixpence out of\nher little humble store; and she advertises herself in a newspaper.\n\nOne always advertises the best side of oneself. (Ah, poor humanity!) My\nbest side was my musical side. In the days of my vicissitudes (before my\nmarriage) I had at one time had a share in a millinery establishment in\nLyons. At another time, I had been bedchamber-woman to a great lady in\nParis. But in my present situation, these sides of myself were, for\nvarious reasons, not so presentable as the pianoforte side. I was not a\ngreat player--far from it. But I had been soundly instructed; and I had,\nwhat you call, a competent skill on the instrument. Brief, I made the\nbest of myself, I promise you, in my advertisement.\n\nThe next day, I borrowed the newspaper, to enjoy the pride of seeing my\ncomposition in print.\n\nAh, heaven! what did I discover? I discovered what other wretched\nadvertising people have found out before me. Above my own advertisement,\nthe very thing I wanted was advertised for by somebody else! Look in any\nnewspaper; and you will see strangers who (if I may so express myself)\nexactly fit each other, advertising for each other, without knowing it. I\nhad advertised myself as \"accomplished musical companion for a lady. With\ncheerful temper to match.\" And there above me was my unknown necessitous\nfellow-creature, crying out in printers' types:--\"Wanted, a companion for\na lady. Must be an accomplished musician, and have a cheerful temper.\nTestimonials to capacity, and first-rate references required.\" Exactly\nwhat I had offered! \"Apply by letter only, in the first instance.\"\nExactly what I had said! Fie upon me, I had spent three and sixpence for\nnothing. I threw down the newspaper, in a transport of anger (like a\nfool)--and then took it up again (like a sensible woman), and applied by\nletter for the offered place.\n\nMy letter brought me into contact with a lawyer. The lawyer enveloped\nhimself in mystery. It seemed to be a professional habit with him to tell\nnobody anything, if he could possibly help it.\n\nDrop by drop, this wearisome man let the circumstances out. The lady was\na young lady. She was the daughter of a clergyman. She lived in a retired\npart of the country. More even than that, she lived in a retired part of\nthe house. Her father had married a second time. Having only the young\nlady as child by his first marriage, he had (I suppose by way of a\nchange) a large family by his second marriage. Circumstances rendered it\nnecessary for the young lady to live as much apart as she could from the\ntumult of a houseful of children. So he went on, until there was no\nkeeping it in any longer--and then he let it out. The young lady was\nblind!\n\nYoung--lonely--blind. I had a sudden inspiration. I felt I should love\nher.\n\nThe question of my musical capacity was, in this sad case, a serious one.\nThe poor young lady had one great pleasure to illumine her dark\nlife--Music. Her companion was wanted to play from the book, and play\nworthily, the works of the great masters (whom this young creature\nadored)--and she, listening, would take her place next at the piano, and\nreproduce the music morsel by morsel, by ear. A professor was appointed\nto pronounce sentence on me, and declare if I could be trusted not to\nmisinterpret Mozart, Beethoven, and the other masters who have written\nfor the piano. Through this ordeal I passed with success. As for my\nreferences, they spoke for themselves. Not even the lawyer (though he\ntried hard) could pick holes in them. It was arranged on both sides that\nI should, in the first instance, go on a month's visit to the young lady.\nIf we both wished it at the end of the time, I was to stay, on terms\narranged to my perfect satisfaction. There was our treaty!\n\nThe next day I started for my visit by the railway.\n\nMy instructions directed me to travel to the town of Lewes in Sussex.\nArrived there, I was to ask for the pony-chaise of my young lady's\nfather--described on his card as Reverend Tertius Finch. The chaise was\nto take me to the rectory-house in the village of Dimchurch. And the\nvillage of Dimchurch was situated among the South Down Hills, three or\nfour miles from the coast.\n\nWhen I stepped into the railway carriage, this was all I knew. After my\nadventurous life--after the volcanic agitations of my republican career\nin the Doctor's time--was I about to bury myself in a remote English\nvillage, and live a life as monotonous as the life of a sheep on a hill?\nAh, with all my experience, I had yet to learn that the narrowest human\nlimits are wide enough to contain the grandest human emotions. I had seen\nthe Drama of Life amid the turmoil of tropical revolutions. I was to see\nit again, with all its palpitating interest, in the breezy solitudes of\nthe South Down Hills.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SECOND\n\nMadame Pratolungo makes a Voyage on Land\n\nA WELL-FED boy, with yellow Saxon hair; a little shabby green chaise; and\na rough brown pony--these objects confronted me at the Lewes Station. I\nsaid to the boy, \"Are you Reverend Finch's servant?\" And the boy\nanswered, \"I be he.\"\n\nWe drove through the town--a hilly town of desolate clean houses. No\nliving creatures visible behind the jealously-shut windows. No living\ncreatures entering or departing through the sad-colored closed doors. No\ntheater; no place of amusement except an empty town-hall, with a sad\npoliceman meditating on its spruce white steps. No customers in the\nshops, and nobody to serve them behind the counter, even if they had\nturned up. Here and there on the pavements, an inhabitant with a capacity\nfor staring, and (apparently) a capacity for nothing else. I said to\nReverend Finch's boy, \"Is this a rich place?\" Reverend Finch's boy\nbrightened and answered, \"That it be!\" Good. At any rate, they don't\nenjoy themselves here--the infamous rich!\n\nLeaving this town of unamused citizens immured in domestic tombs, we got\non a fine high road--still ascending--with a spacious open country on\neither side of it.\n\nA spacious open country is a country soon exhausted by a sight-seer's\neye. I have learnt from my poor Pratolungo the habit of searching for the\npolitical convictions of my fellow-creatures, when I find myself in\ncontact with them in strange places. Having nothing else to do, I\nsearched Finch's boy. His political programme, I found to be:--As much\nmeat and beer as I can contain; and as little work to do for it as\npossible. In return for this, to touch my hat when I meet the Squire, and\nto be content with the station to which it has pleased God to call me.\nMiserable Finch's boy!\n\nWe reached the highest point of the road. On our right hand, the ground\nsloped away gently into a fertile valley--with a village and a church in\nit; and beyond, an abominable privileged enclosure of grass and trees\ntorn from the community by a tyrant, and called a Park; with the palace\nin which this enemy of mankind caroused and fattened, standing in the\nmidst. On our left hand, spread the open country--a magnificent prospect\nof grand grassy hills, rolling away to the horizon; bounded only by the\nsky. To my surprise, Finch's boy descended; took the pony by the head;\nand deliberately led him off the high road, and on to the wilderness of\ngrassy hills, on which not so much as a footpath was discernible\nanywhere, far or near. The chaise began to heave and roll like a ship on\nthe sea. It became necessary to hold with both hands to keep my place. I\nthought first of my luggage--then of myself.\n\n\"How much is there of this?\" I asked.\n\n\"Three mile on't,\" answered Finch's boy.\n\nI insisted on stopping the ship--I mean the chaise--and on getting out.\nWe tied my luggage fast with a rope; and then we went on again, the boy\nat the pony's head, and I after them on foot.\n\nAh, what a walk it was! What air over my head; what grass under my feet!\nThe sweetness of the inner land, and the crisp saltness of the distant\nsea, were mixed in that delicious breeze. The short turf, fragrant with\nodorous herbs, rose and fell elastic, underfoot. The mountain-piles of\nwhite cloud moved in sublime procession along the blue field of heaven,\noverhead. The wild growth of prickly bushes, spread in great patches over\nthe grass, was in a glory of yellow bloom. On we went; now up, now down;\nnow bending to the right, and now turning to the left. I looked about me.\nNo house; no road; no paths, fences, hedges, walls; no land-marks of any\nsort. All round us, turn which way we might, nothing was to be seen but\nthe majestic solitude of the hills. No living creatures appeared but the\nwhite dots of sheep scattered over the soft green distance, and the\nskylark singing his hymn of happiness, a speck above my head. Truly a\nwonderful place! Distant not more than a morning's drive from noisy and\npopulous Brighton--a stranger to this neighborhood could only have found\nhis way by the compass, exactly as if he had been sailing on the sea! The\nfarther we penetrated on our land-voyage, the more wild and the more\nbeautiful the solitary landscape grew. The boy picked his way as he\nchose--there were no barriers here. Plodding behind, I saw nothing, at\none time, but the back of the chaise, tilted up in the air, both boy and\npony being invisibly buried in the steep descent of the hill. At other\ntimes, the pitch was all the contrary way; the whole interior of the\nascending chaise was disclosed to my view, and above the chaise the pony,\nand above the pony the boy--and, ah, my luggage swaying and rocking in\nthe frail embraces of the rope that held it. Twenty times did I\nconfidently expect to see baggage, chaise, pony, boy, all rolling down\ninto the bottom of a valley together. But no! Not the least little\naccident happened to spoil my enjoyment of the day. Politically\ncontemptible, Finch's boy had his merit--he was master of his subject as\nguide and pony-leader among the South Down Hills.\n\nArrived at the top of (as it seemed to me) our fiftieth grassy summit, I\nbegan to look about for signs of the village.\n\nBehind me, rolled back the long undulations of the hills, with the\ncloud-shadows moving over the solitudes that we had left. Before me, at a\nbreak in the purple distance, I saw the soft white line of the sea.\nBeneath me, at my feet, opened the deepest valley I had noticed yet--with\none first sign of the presence of Man scored hideously on the face of\nNature, in the shape of a square brown patch of cleared and ploughed land\non the grassy slope. I asked if we were getting near the village now.\nFinch's boy winked, and answered, \"Yes, we be.\"\n\nAstonishing Finch's boy! Ask him what questions I might, the resources of\nhis vocabulary remained invariably the same. Still this youthful Oracle\nanswered always in three monosyllabic words!\n\nWe plunged into the valley.\n\nArrived at the bottom, I discovered another sign of Man. Behold the first\nroad I had seen yet--a rough wagon-road ploughed deep in the chalky soil!\nWe crossed this, and turned a corner of a hill. More signs of human life.\nTwo small boys started up out of a ditch--apparently posted as scouts to\ngive notice of our approach. They yelled, and set off running before us,\nby some short cut, known only to themselves. We turned again, round\nanother winding of the valley, and crossed a brook. I considered it my\nduty to make myself acquainted with the local names. What was the brook\ncalled? It was called \"The Cockshoot\"! And the great hill, here, on my\nright? It was called \"The Overblow\"! Five minutes more, and we saw our\nfirst house--lonely and little--built of mortar and flint from the hills.\nA name to this also? Certainly. Name of \"Browndown.\" Another ten minutes\nof walking, involving us more and more deeply in the mysterious green\nwindings of the valley--and the great event of the day happened at last.\nFinch's boy pointed before him with his whip, and said (even at this\nsupreme moment, still in three monosyllabic words):--\n\n\"Here we be!\"\n\nSo this is Dimchurch! I shake out the chalk-dust from the skirts of my\ndress. I long (quite vainly) for the least bit of looking-glass to see\nmyself in. Here is the population (to the number of at least five or\nsix), gathered together, informed by the scouts--and it is my woman's\nbusiness to produce the best impression of myself that I can. We advance\nalong the little road. I smile upon the population. The population stares\nat me in return. On one side, I remark three or four cottages, and a bit\nof open ground; also an inn named \"The Cross-Hands,\" and a bit more of\nopen ground; also a tiny, tiny butcher's shop, with sanguinary insides of\nsheep on one blue pie-dish in the window, and no other meat than that,\nand nothing to see beyond, but again the open ground, and again the\nhills; indicating the end of the village this side. On the other side\nthere appears, for some distance, nothing but a long flint wall guarding\nthe outhouses of a farm. Beyond this, comes another little group of\ncottages, with the seal of civilization set on them, in the form of a\npost-office. The post-office deals in general commodities--in boots and\nbacon, biscuits and flannel, crinoline petticoats and religious tracts.\nFarther on, behold another flint wall, a garden, and a private\ndwelling-house; proclaiming itself as the rectory. Farther yet, on rising\nground, a little desolate church, with a tiny white circular steeple,\ntopped by an extinguisher in red tiles. Beyond this, the hills and the\nheavens once more. And there is Dimchurch!\n\nAs for the inhabitants--what am I to say? I suppose I must tell the\ntruth.\n\nI remarked one born gentleman among the inhabitants, and he was a\nsheep-dog. He alone did the honors of the place. He had a stump of a\ntail, which he wagged at me with extreme difficulty, and a good honest\nwhite and black face which he poked companionably into my hand. \"Welcome,\nMadame Pratolungo, to Dimchurch; and excuse these male and female\nlaborers who stand and stare at you. The good God who makes us all has\nmade them too, but has not succeeded so well as with you and me.\" I\nhappen to be one of the few people who can read dogs' language as written\nin dogs' faces. I correctly report the language of the gentleman\nsheep-dog on this occasion.\n\nWe opened the gate of the rectory, and passed in. So my Land-Voyage over\nthe South Down Hills came prosperously to its end.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRD\n\nPoor Miss Finch\n\nTHE rectory resembled, in one respect, this narrative that I am now\nwriting. It was in Two Parts. Part the First, in front, composed of the\neverlasting flint and mortar of the neighborhood, failed to interest me.\nPart the Second, running back at a right angle, asserted itself as\nancient. It had been, in its time, as I afterwards heard, a convent of\nnuns. Here were snug little Gothic windows, and dark ivy-covered walls of\nvenerable stone: repaired in places, at some past period, with quaint red\nbricks. I had hoped that I should enter the house by this side of it. But\nno. The boy--after appearing to be at a loss what to do with me--led the\nway to a door on the modern side of the building, and rang the bell.\n\nA slovenly young maid-servant admitted me to the house.\n\nPossibly, this person was new to the duty of receiving visitors.\nPossibly, she was bewildered by a sudden invasion of children in dirty\nfrocks, darting out on us in the hall, and then darting away again into\ninvisible back regions, screeching at the sight of a stranger. At any\nrate, she too appeared to be at a loss what to do with me. After staring\nhard at my foreign face, she suddenly opened a door in the wall of the\npassage, and admitted me into a small room. Two more children in dirty\nfrocks darted, screaming, out of the asylum thus offered to me. I\nmentioned my name, as soon as I could make myself heard. The maid\nappeared to be terrified at the length of it. I gave her my card. The\nmaid took it between a dirty finger and thumb--looked at it as if it was\nsome extraordinary natural curiosity--turned it round, exhibiting correct\nblack impressions in various parts of it of her finger and thumb--gave up\nunderstanding it in despair, and left the room. She was stopped outside\n(as I gathered from the sounds) by a returning invasion of children in\nthe hall. There was whispering; there was giggling; there was, every now\nand then, a loud thump on the door. Prompted by the children, as I\nsuppose--pushed in by them, certainly--the maid suddenly reappeared with\na jerk, \"Oh, if you please, come this way,\" she said. The invasion of\nchildren retreated again up the stairs--one of them in possession of my\ncard, and waving it in triumph on the first landing. We penetrated to the\nother end of the passage. Again, a door was opened. Unannounced, I\nentered another, and a larger room. What did I see?\n\nFortune had favored me at last. My lucky star had led me to the mistress\nof the house.\n\nI made my best curtsey, and found myself confronting a large,\nlight-haired, languid, lymphatic lady--who had evidently been amusing\nherself by walking up and down the room, at the moment when I appeared.\nIf there can be such a thing as a _damp woman_--this was one. There was a\nhumid shine on her colorless white face, and an overflow of water in her\npale blue eyes. Her hair was not dressed; and her lace cap was all on one\nside. The upper part of her was clothed in a loose jacket of blue merino;\nthe lower part was robed in a dimity dressing gown of doubtful white. In\none hand, she held a dirty dogs'-eared book, which I at once detected to\nbe a Circulating Library novel. Her other hand supported a baby enveloped\nin flannel, sucking at her breast. Such was my first experience of\nReverend Finch's Wife--destined to be also the experience of all\naftertime. Never completely dressed; never completely dry; always with a\nbaby in one hand and a novel in the other--such was Finch's wife.\n\n\"Oh! Madame Pratolungo? Yes. I hope somebody has told Miss Finch you are\nhere. She has her own establishment, and manages everything herself. Have\nyou had a pleasant journey?\" (These words were spoken vacantly, as if her\nmind was occupied with something else. My first impression of her\nsuggested that she was a weak, good-natured woman, and that she must have\noriginally occupied a station in the humbler ranks of life.)\n\n\"Thank you, Mrs. Finch,\" I said. \"I have enjoyed most heartily my journey\namong your beautiful hills.\"\n\n\"Oh! you like the hills? Excuse my dress. I was half an hour late this\nmorning. When you lose half an hour in this house, you never can pick it\nup again, try how you may.\" (I soon discovered that Mrs. Finch was always\nlosing half an hour out of her day, and that she never, by any chance,\nsucceeded in ending it again, as she had just told me.)\n\n\"I understand, madam. The cares of a numerous family--\"\n\n\"Ah! that's just where it is.\" (This was a favorite phrase with Mrs.\nFinch). \"There's Finch, he gets up in the morning and goes and works in\nthe garden. Then there's the washing of the children; and the dreadful\nwaste that goes on in the kitchen. And Finch, he comes in without any\nnotice, and wants his breakfast. And of course I can't leave the baby.\nAnd half an hour does slip away so easily, that how to overtake it again,\nI do assure you I really don't know.\" Here the baby began to exhibit\nsymptoms of having taken more maternal nourishment than his infant\nstomach could comfortably contain. I held the novel, while Mrs. Finch\nsearched for her handkerchief--first in her bedgown pocket; secondly,\nhere, there, and everywhere in the room.\n\nAt this interesting moment there was a knock at the door. An elderly\nwoman appeared--who offered a most refreshing contrast to the members of\nthe household with whom I had made acquaintance thus far. She was neatly\ndressed, and she saluted me with the polite composure of a civilized\nbeing.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, ma'am. My young lady has only this moment heard of\nyour arrival. Will you be so kind as to follow me?\"\n\nI turned to Mrs. Finch. She had found her handkerchief, and had put her\noverflowing baby to rights again. I respectfully handed back the novel.\n\"Thank you,\" said Mrs. Finch. \"I find novels compose my mind. Do you read\nnovels too? Remind me--and I'll lend you this one to-morrow.\" I expressed\nmy acknowledgments, and withdrew. At the door, I look round, saluting the\nlady of the house. Mrs. Finch was promenading the room, with the baby in\none hand and the novel in the other, and the dimity bedgown trailing\nbehind her.\n\nWe ascended the stairs, and entered a bare white-washed passage, with\ndrab-colored doors in it, leading, as I presumed, into the sleeping\nchambers of the house.\n\nEvery door opened as we passed; children peeped out at me, screamed at\nme, and banged the door to again. \"What family has the present Mrs.\nFinch?\" I asked. The decent elderly woman was obliged to stop, and\nconsider. \"Including the baby, ma'am, and two sets of twins, and one\nseven months' child of deficient intellect--fourteen in all.\" Hearing\nthis, I began--though I consider priests, kings, and capitalists to be\nthe enemies of the human race--to feel a certain exceptional interest in\nReverend Finch. Did he never wish that he had been a priest of the Roman\nCatholic Church, mercifully forbidden to marry at all? While the question\npassed through my mind, my guide took out a key, and opened a heavy oaken\ndoor at the further end of the passage.\n\n\"We are obliged to keep the door locked, ma'am,\" she explained, \"or the\nchildren would be in and out of our part of the house all day long.\"\n\nAfter my experience of the children, I own I looked at the oaken door\nwith mingled sentiments of gratitude and respect.\n\nWe turned a corner, and found ourselves in the vaulted corridor of the\nancient portion of the house.\n\nThe casement windows, on one side--sunk deep in recesses--looked into the\ngarden. Each recess was filled with groups of flowers in pots. On the\nother side, the old wall was gaily decorated with hangings of bright\nchintz. The doors were colored of a creamy white, with gilt moldings. The\nbrightly ornamented matting under our feet I at once recognized as of\nSouth American origin. The ceiling above was decorated in delicate pale\nblue, with borderings of flowers. Nowhere down the whole extent of the\nplace was so much as a single morsel of dark color to be seen anywhere.\n\nAt the lower end of the corridor, a solitary figure in a pure white robe\nwas bending over the flowers in the window. This was the blind girl whose\ndark hours I had come to cheer. In the scattered villages of the South\nDowns, the simple people added their word of pity to her name, and called\nher compassionately--\"Poor Miss Finch.\" As for me, I can only think of\nher by her pretty Christian name. She is \"Lucilla\" when my memory dwells\non her. Let me call her \"Lucilla\" here.\n\nWhen my eyes first rested on her, she was picking off the dead leaves\nfrom her flowers. Her delicate ear detected the sound of my strange\nfootstep, long before I reached the place at which she was standing. She\nlifted her head--and advanced quickly to meet me with a faint flush on\nher face, which came and died away again in a moment. I happen to have\nvisited the picture gallery at Dresden in former years. As she approached\nme, nearer and nearer, I was irresistibly reminded of the gem of that\nsuperb collection--the matchless Virgin of Raphael, called \"The Madonna\ndi San Sisto.\" The fair broad forehead; the peculiar fullness of the\nflesh between the eyebrow and the eyelid; the delicate outline of the\nlower face; the tender, sensitive lips; the color of the complexion and\nthe hair--all reflected, with a startling fidelity, the lovely creature\nof the Dresden picture. The one fatal point at which the resemblance\nceased, was in the eyes. The divinely-beautiful eyes of Raphael's Virgin\nwere lost in the living likeness of her that confronted me now. There was\nno deformity; there was nothing to recoil from, in my blind Lucilla. The\npoor, dim, sightless eyes had a faded, changeless, inexpressive look--and\nthat was all. Above them, below them, round them, to the very edges of\nher eyelids, there was beauty, movement, life. _In_ them--death! A more\ncharming creature--with that one sad drawback--I never saw. There was no\nother personal defect in her. She had the fine height, the well-balanced\nfigure, and the length of the lower limbs, which make all a woman's\nmovements graceful of themselves. Her voice was delicious--clear,\ncheerful, sympathetic. This, and her smile--which added a charm of its\nown to the beauty of her mouth--won my heart, before she had got close\nenough to me to put her hand in mine. \"Ah, my dear!\" I said, in my\nheadlong way, \"I am so glad to see you!\" The instant the words passed my\nlips, I could have cut my tongue out for reminding her in that brutal\nmanner that she was blind.\n\nTo my relief, she showed no sign of feeling it as I did. \"May I see you,\nin _my_ way?\" she asked gently--and held up her pretty white hand. \"May I\ntouch your face?\"\n\nI sat down at once on the window-seat. The soft rosy tips of her fingers\nseemed to cover my whole face in an instant. Three separate times she\npassed her hand rapidly over me; her own face absorbed all the while in\nbreathless attention to what she was about. \"Speak again!\" she said\nsuddenly, holding her hand over me in suspense. I said a few words. She\nstopped me by a kiss. \"No more!\" she exclaimed joyously. \"Your voice says\nto my ears, what your face says to my fingers. I know I shall like you.\nCome in, and see the rooms we are going to live in together.\"\n\nAs I rose, she put her arm round my waist--then instantly drew it away\nagain, and shook her fingers impatiently, as if something had hurt them.\n\n\"A pin?\" I asked.\n\n\"No! no! What colored dress have you got on?\"\n\n\"Purple.\"\n\n\"Ah! I knew it! Pray don't wear dark colors. I have my own blind horror\nof anything that is dark. Dear Madame Pratolungo, wear pretty bright\ncolors, to please _me!_\" She put her arm caressingly round me\nagain--round my neck, however, this time, where her hand could rest on my\nlinen collar. \"You will change your dress before dinner--won't you?\" she\nwhispered. \"Let me unpack for you, and choose which dress I like.\"\n\nThe brilliant decorations of the corridor were explained to me now!\n\nWe entered the rooms; her bed-room, my bed-room, and our sitting-room\nbetween the two. I was prepared to find them, what they proved to be--as\nbright as looking-glasses, and gilding, and gaily-colored ornaments, and\ncheerful knick-knacks of all sorts could make them. They were more like\nrooms in my lively native country than rooms in sober colorless England.\nThe one thing which I own did still astonish me, was that all this\nsparkling beauty of adornment in Lucilla's habitation should have been\nprovided for the express gratification of a young lady who could not see.\nExperience was yet to show me that the blind can live in their\nimaginations, and have their favorite fancies and illusions like the rest\nof us.\n\nTo satisfy Lucilla by changing my dark purple dress, it was necessary\nthat I should first have my boxes. So far as I knew, Finch's boy had\ntaken my luggage, along with the pony, to the stables. Before Lucilla\ncould ring the bell to make inquiries, my elderly guide (who had silently\nleft us while we were talking together in the corridor) re-appeared,\nfollowed by the boy and a groom, carrying my things. These servants also\nbrought with them certain parcels for their young mistress, purchased in\nthe town, together with a bottle, wrapped in fair white paper, which\nlooked like a bottle of medicine--and which had a part of its own to play\nin our proceedings, later in the day.\n\n\"This is my old nurse,\" said Lucilla, presenting her attendant to me.\n\"Zillah can do a little of everything--cooking included. She has had\nlessons at a London Club. You must like Zillah, Madame Pratolungo, for my\nsake. Are your boxes open?\"\n\nShe went down on her knees before the boxes, as she asked the question.\nNo girl with the full use of her eyes could have enjoyed more thoroughly\nthan she did the trivial amusement of unpacking my clothes. This time,\nhowever, her wonderful delicacy of touch proved to be at fault. Of two\ndresses of mine which happened to be exactly the same in texture, though\nwidely different in color, she picked out the dark dress as being the\nlight one. I saw that I disappointed her sadly when I told her of her\nmistake. The next guess she made, however, restored the tips of her\nfingers to their place in her estimation: she discovered the stripes in a\nsmart pair of stockings of mine, and brightened up directly. \"Don't be\nlong dressing,\" she said, on leaving me. \"We shall have dinner in half an\nhour. French dishes, in honor of your arrival. I like a nice dinner--I am\nwhat you call in your country, _gourmande._ See the sad consequence!\" She\nput one finger to her pretty chin. \"I am getting fat! I am threatened\nwith a double chin--at two and twenty. Shocking! shocking!\"\n\nSo she left me. And such was the first impression produced on my mind by\n\"Poor Miss Finch.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FOURTH\n\nTwilight View of the Man\n\nOUR nice dinner had long since come to an end. We had chattered,\nchattered, chattered--as usual with women--all about ourselves. The day\nhad declined; the setting sun was pouring its last red luster into our\npretty sitting-room--when Lucilla started as if she had suddenly\nremembered something, and rang the bell.\n\nZillah came in. \"The bottle from the chemist's,\" said Lucilla. \"I ought\nto have remembered it hours ago.\"\n\n\"Are you going to take it to Susan yourself, my dear?\"\n\nI was glad to hear the old nurse address her young lady in that familiar\nway. It was so thoroughly un-English. Down with the devilish system of\nseparation between the classes in this country--that is what I say!\n\n\"Yes; I am going to take it to Susan myself.\"\n\n\"Shall I go with you?\"\n\n\"No, no. Not the least occasion.\" She turned to me. \"I suppose you are\ntoo tired to go out again, after your walk on the hills?\" she said.\n\nI had dined; I had rested; I was quite ready to go out again, and I said\nso.\n\nLucilla's face brightened. For some reason of her own, she had apparently\nattached a certain importance to persuading me to go out with her.\n\n\"It's only a visit to a poor rheumatic woman in the village,\" she said.\n\"I have got an embrocation for her; and I can't very well send it. She is\nold and obstinate. If I take it to her, she will believe in the remedy.\nIf anybody else takes it, she will throw it away. I had utterly forgotten\nher, in the interest of our nice long talk. Shall we get ready?\"\n\nI had hardly closed the door of my bedroom when there was a knock at it.\nLucilla? No; the old nurse entering on tiptoe, with a face of mystery,\nand a finger confidentially placed on her lips.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, ma'am,\" she began in a whisper. \"I think you ought to\nknow that my young lady has a purpose in taking you out with her this\nevening. She is burning with curiosity--like all the rest of us for that\nmatter. She took me out, and used my eyes to see with, yesterday evening;\nand they have not satisfied her. She is going to try your eyes, now.\"\n\n\"What is Miss Lucilla so curious about?\" I inquired.\n\n\"It's natural enough, poor dear,\" pursued the old woman, following her\nown train of thought, without the slightest reference to my question. \"We\nnone of us can find out anything about him. He usually takes his walk at\ntwilight. You are pretty sure to meet him to-night; and you will judge\nfor yourself, ma'am--with an innocent young creature like Miss\nLucilla--what it may be best to do?\"\n\nThis extraordinary answer set _my_ curiosity in a flame.\n\n\"My good creature!\" I said, \"you forget that I am a stranger! I know\nnothing about it. Has this mysterious man got a name? Who is 'He'?\"\n\nAs I said that, there was another knock at the door. Zillah whispered,\neagerly, \"Don't tell upon me, ma'am! You will see for yourself. I only\nspeak for my young lady's good.\" She hobbled away, and opened the\ndoor--and there was Lucilla, with her smart garden hat on, waiting for\nme.\n\nWe went out by our own door into the garden, and passing through a gate\nin the wall, entered the village.\n\nAfter the caution which the nurse had given me, it was impossible to ask\nany questions, except at the risk of making mischief in our little\nhousehold, on the first day of my joining it. I kept my eyes wide open,\nand waited for events. I also committed a blunder at starting--I offered\nLucilla my hand to lead her. She burst out laughing.\n\n\"My dear Madame Pratolungo! I know my way better than you do. I roam all\nover the neighborhood, with nothing to help me but this.\"\n\nShe held up a smart ivory walking-cane, with a bright silk tassel\nattached. With her cane in one hand, and her chemical bottle in the\nother--and her roguish little hat on the top of her head--she made the\nquaintest and prettiest picture I had seen for many a long day. \"_You_\nshall guide _me_, my dear,\" I said--and took her arm. We went on down the\nvillage.\n\nNothing in the least like a mysterious figure passed us in the twilight.\nThe few scattered laboring people, whom I had already seen, I saw\nagain--and that was all. Lucilla was silent--suspiciously silent as I\nthought, after what Zillah had told me. She had, as I fancied, the look\nof a person who was listening intently. Arrived at the cottage of the\nrheumatic woman, she stopped and went in, while I waited outside. The\naffair of the embrocation was soon over. She was out again in a\nminute--and this time, she took my arm of her own accord.\n\n\"Shall we go a little farther?\" she said. \"It is so nice and cool at this\nhour of the evening.\"\n\nHer object in view, whatever it might be, was evidently an object that\nlay beyond the village. In the solemn, peaceful twilight we followed the\nlonely windings of the valley along which I had passed in the morning.\nWhen we came opposite the little solitary house, which I had already\nlearnt to know as \"Browndown,\" I felt her hand unconsciously tighten on\nmy arm. \"Aha!\" I said to myself. \"Has Browndown anything to do with\nthis?\"\n\n\"Does the view look very lonely to-night?\" she asked, waving her cane\nover the scene before us.\n\nThe true meaning of that question I took to be, \"Do you see anybody\nwalking out to-night?\" It was not my business to interpret her meaning,\nbefore she had thought fit to confide her secret to me. \"To my mind, my\ndear,\" was all I said, \"it is a very beautiful view.\"\n\nShe fell silent again, and absorbed herself in her own thoughts. We\nturned into a new winding of the valley--and there, walking towards us\nfrom the opposite direction, was a human figure at last--the figure of a\nsolitary man!\n\nAs we got nearer to each other I perceived that he was a gentleman;\ndressed in a light shooting-jacket, and wearing a felt hat of the conical\nItalian shape. A little nearer--and I saw that he was young. Nearer\nstill--and I discovered that he was handsome, though in rather an\neffeminate way. At the same moment, Lucilla heard his footstep. Her color\ninstantly rose; and once again I felt her hand tighten involuntarily\nround my arm. (Good! Here was the mysterious object of Zillah's warning\nto me found at last!)\n\nI have, and I don't mind acknowledging it, an eye for a handsome man. I\nlooked at him as he passed us. Now I solemnly assure you, I am not an\nugly woman. Nevertheless, as our eyes met, I saw the strange gentleman's\nface suddenly contract, with an expression which told me plainly that I\nhad produced a disagreeable impression on him. With some difficulty--for\nmy companion was holding my arm, and seemed to be disposed to stop\naltogether--I quickened my pace so as to get by him rapidly; showing him,\nI dare say, that I thought the change in his face when I looked at him,\nan impertinence on his part. However that may be, after a momentary\ninterval, I heard his step behind. The man had turned, and had followed\nus.\n\nHe came close to me, on the opposite side to Lucilla, and took off his\nhat.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, ma'am,\" he said. \"You looked at me just now.\"\n\nAt the first sound of his voice, I felt Lucilla start. Her hand began to\ntremble on my arm with some sudden agitation, inconceivable to me. In the\ndouble surprise of discovering this, and of finding myself charged so\nabruptly with the offense of looking at a gentleman, I suffered the most\nexceptional of all losses (where a woman is concerned)--the loss of my\ntongue.\n\nHe gave me no time to recover myself. He proceeded with what he had to\nsay--speaking, mind, in the tone of a perfectly well-bred man; with\nnothing wild in his look, and nothing odd in his manner.\n\n\"Excuse me, if I venture on asking you a very strange question,\" he went\non. \"Did you happen to be at Exeter, on the third of last month?\"\n\n(I must have been more or less than woman, if I had not recovered the use\nof my tongue now!)\n\n\"I never was at Exeter in my life, sir,\" I answered. \"May I ask, on my\nside, why you put the question to me?\"\n\nInstead of replying, he looked at Lucilla.\n\n\"Pardon me, once more. Perhaps this young lady----?\"\n\nHe was plainly on the point of inquiring next, whether Lucilla had been\nat Exeter--when he checked himself. In the breathless interest which she\nfelt in what was going on, she had turned her full face upon him. There\nwas still light enough left for her eyes to tell their own sad story, in\ntheir own mute way. As he read the truth in them, the man's face changed\nfrom the keen look of scrutiny which it had worn thus far, to an\nexpression of compassion--I had almost said, of distress. He again took\noff his hat, and bowed to me with the deepest respect.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" he said, very earnestly. \"I beg the young lady's\npardon. Pray forgive me. My strange behavior has its excuse--if I could\nbring myself to explain it. You distressed me, when you looked at me. I\ncan't explain why. Good evening.\"\n\nHe turned away hastily, like a man confused and ashamed of himself--and\nleft us. I can only repeat that there was nothing strange or flighty in\nhis manner. A perfect gentleman, in full possession of his senses--there\nis the unexaggerated and the just description of him.\n\nI looked at Lucilla. She was standing, with her blind face raised to the\nsky, lost in herself, like a person wrapped in ecstasy.\n\n\"Who is that man?\" I asked.\n\nMy question brought her down suddenly from heaven to earth. \"Oh!\" she\nsaid reproachfully, \"I had his voice still in my ears--and now I have\nlost it! 'Who is he?'\" she added, after a moment; repeating my question.\n\"Nobody knows. Tell me--what is he like. Is he beautiful? He _must_ be\nbeautiful, with that voice!\"\n\n\"Is this the first time you have heard his voice?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Yes. He passed us yesterday, when I was out with Zillah. But he never\nspoke. What is he like? Do, pray tell me--what is he like?\"\n\nThere was a passionate impatience in her tone which warned me not to\ntrifle with her. The darkness was coming. I thought it wise to propose\nreturning to the house. She consented to do anything I liked, as long as\nI consented, on my side, to describe the unknown man.\n\nAll the way back, I was questioned and cross-questioned till I felt like\na witness under skillful examination in a court of law. Lucilla appeared\nto be satisfied, so far, with the results. \"Ah!\" she exclaimed, letting\nout the secret which her old nurse had confided to me. \"_You_ can use\nyour eyes. Zillah could tell me nothing.\"\n\nWhen we got home again, her curiosity took another turn. \"Exeter?\" she\nsaid, considering with herself. \"He mentioned Exeter. I am like you--I\nnever was there. What will books tell us about Exeter?\" She despatched\nZillah to the other side of the house for a gazetteer. I followed the old\nwoman into the corridor, and set her mind at ease, in a whisper. \"I have\nkept what you told me a secret,\" I said. \"The man was out in the\ntwilight, as you foresaw. I have spoken to him; and I am quite as curious\nas the rest of you. Get the book.\"\n\nLucilla had (to confess the truth) infected me with her idea, that the\ngazetteer might help us in interpreting the stranger's remarkable\nquestion relating to the third of last month, and his extraordinary\nassertion that I had distressed him when I looked at him. With the nurse\nbreathless on one side of me, and Lucilla breathless on the other, I\nopened the book at the letter \"E,\" and found the place, and read aloud\nthese lines, as follows:--\n\n\"EXETER: A city and seaport in Devonshire. Formerly the seat of the West\nSaxon Kings. It has a large foreign and home commerce. Population 33,738.\nThe Assizes for Devonshire are held at Exeter in the spring and summer.\"\n\n\"Is that all?\" asked Lucilla.\n\nI shut the book, and answered, like Finch's boy, in three monosyllabic\nwords:\n\n\"That is all.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FIFTH\n\nCandlelight View of the Man\n\nTHERE had been barely light enough left for me to read by. Zillah lit the\ncandles and drew the curtains. The silence which betokens a profound\ndisappointment reigned in the room.\n\n\"Who can he be?\" repeated Lucilla, for the hundredth time. \"And why\nshould your looking at him have distressed him? Guess, Madame\nPratolungo!\"\n\nThe last sentence in the gazetteer's description of Exeter hung a little\non my mind--in consequence of there being one word in it which I did not\nquite understand--the word \"Assizes.\" I have, I hope, shown that I\npossess a competent knowledge of the English language, by this time. But\nmy experience fails a little on the side of phrases consecrated to the\nuse of the law. I inquired into the meaning of \"Assizes,\" and was\ninformed that it signified movable Courts, for trying prisoners at given\ntimes, in various parts of England. Hearing this, I had another of my\ninspirations. I guessed immediately that the interesting stranger was a\ncriminal escaped from the Assizes.\n\nWorthy old Zillah started to her feet, convinced that I had hit him off\n(as the English saying is) to a T. \"Mercy preserve us!\" cried the nurse,\n\"I haven't bolted the garden door!\"\n\nShe hurried out of the room to defend us from robbery and murder, before\nit was too late. I looked at Lucilla. She was leaning back in her chair,\nwith a smile of quiet contempt on her pretty face. \"Madame Pratolungo,\"\nshe remarked, \"that is the first foolish thing you have said, since you\nhave been here.\"\n\n\"Wait a little, my dear,\" I rejoined. \"You have declared that nothing is\nknown of this man. Now you mean by that--nothing which satisfies _you._\nHe has not dropped down from Heaven, I suppose? The time when he came\nhere, must be known. Also, whether he came alone, or not. Also, how and\nwhere he has found a lodging in the village. Before I admit that my guess\nis completely wrong, I want to hear what general observation in Dimchurch\nhas discovered on the subject of this gentleman. How long has he been\nhere?\"\n\nLucilla did not, at first, appear to be much interested in the purely\npractical view of the question which I had just placed before her.\n\n\"He has been here a week,\" she answered carelessly.\n\n\"Did he come, as I came, over the hills?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"With a guide, of course?\"\n\nLucilla suddenly sat up in her chair.\n\n\"With his brother,\" she said. \"His _twin_ brother, Madame Pratolungo.\"\n\n_I_ sat up in _my_ chair. The appearance of his twin-brother in the story\nwas a complication in itself. Two criminals escaped from the Assizes,\ninstead of one!\n\n\"How did they find their way here?\" I asked next.\n\n\"Nobody knows.\"\n\n\"Where did they go to, when they got here?\"\n\n\"To the Cross-Hands--the little public-house in the village. The landlord\ntold Zillah he was perfectly astonished at the resemblance between them.\nIt was impossible to know which was which--it was wonderful, even for\ntwins. They arrived early in the day, when the tap-room was empty; and\nthey had a long talk together in private. At the end of it, they rang for\nthe landlord, and asked if he had a bed-room to let in the house. You\nmust have seen for yourself that The Cross-Hands is a mere beer-shop. The\nlandlord had a room that he could spare--a wretched place, not fit for a\ngentleman to sleep in. One of the brothers took the room for all that.\"\n\n\"What became of the other brother?\"\n\n\"He went away the same day--very unwillingly. The parting between them\nwas most affecting. The brother who spoke to us to-night insisted on\nit--or the other would have refused to leave him. They both shed\ntears----\"\n\n\"They did worse than that,\" said old Zillah, re-entering the room at the\nmoment. \"I have made all the doors and windows fast, downstairs; he can't\nget in now, my dear, if he tries.\"\n\n\"What did they do that was worse than crying?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Kissed each other!\" said Zillah, with a look of profound disgust. \"Two\nmen! Foreigners, of course.\"\n\n\"Our man is no foreigner,\" I said. \"Did they give themselves a name?\"\n\n\"The landlord asked the one who stayed behind for his name,\" replied\nLucilla. \"He said it was 'Dubourg.'\"\n\nThis confirmed me in my belief that I had guessed right. \"Dubourg\" is as\ncommon a name in my country as \"Jones\" or \"Thompson\" is in England--just\nthe sort of feigned name that a man in difficulties would give among\n_us._ Was he a criminal countryman of mine? No! There had been nothing\nforeign in his accent when he spoke. Pure English--there could be no\ndoubt of that. And yet he had given a French name. Had he deliberately\ninsulted my nation? Yes! Not content with being stained by innumerable\ncrimes, he had added to the list of his atrocities--he had insulted my\nnation!\n\n\"Well?\" I resumed. \"We have left this undetected ruffian deserted in the\npublic-house. Is he there still?\"\n\n\"Bless your heart!\" cried the old nurse, \"he is settled in the\nneighborhood. He has taken Browndown.\"\n\nI turned to Lucilla. \"Browndown belongs to Somebody,\" I said hazarding\nanother guess. \"Did Somebody let it without a reference?\"\n\n\"Browndown belongs to a gentleman at Brighton,\" answered Lucilla. \"And\nthe gentleman was referred to a well-known name in London--one of the\ngreat City merchants. Here is the most provoking part of the whole\nmystery. The merchant said, 'I have known Mr. Dubourg from his childhood.\nHe has reasons for wishing to live in the strictest retirement. I answer\nfor his being an honorable man, to whom you can safely let your house.\nMore than this I am not authorized to tell you.' My father knows the\nlandlord of Browndown; and that is what the reference said to him, word\nfor word. Isn't it provoking? The house was let for six months certain,\nthe next day. It is wretchedly furnished. Mr. Dubourg has had several\nthings that he wanted sent from Brighton. Besides the furniture, a\npacking-case from London arrived at the house to-day. It was so strongly\nnailed up that the carpenter had to be sent for to open it. He reports\nthat the case was full of thin plates of gold and silver; and it was\naccompanied by a box of extraordinary tools, the use of which was a\nmystery to the carpenter himself. Mr. Dubourg locked up these things in a\nroom at the back of the house, and put the key in his pocket. He seemed\nto be pleased--he whistled a tune, and said, 'Now we shall do!' The\nlandlady at the Cross-Hands is our authority for this. She does what\nlittle cooking he requires; and her daughter makes his bed, and so on.\nThey go to him in the morning, and return to the inn in the evening. He\nhas no servant with him. He is all by himself at night. Isn't it\ninteresting? A mystery in real life. It baffles everybody.\"\n\n\"You must be very strange people, my dear,\" I said, \"to make a mystery of\nsuch a plain case as this.\"\n\n\"Plain?\" repeated Lucilla, in amazement.\n\n\"Certainly! The gold and silver plates, and the strange tools, and the\nliving in retirement, and the sending the servants away at night--all\npoint to the same conclusion. My guess is the right one. The man is an\nescaped criminal; and his form of crime is coining false money. He has\nbeen discovered at Exeter--he has escaped the officers of justice--and he\nis now going to begin again here. You can do as you please. If _I_ happen\nto want change, I won't get it in this neighborhood.\"\n\nLucilla laid herself back in her chair again. I could see that she gave\nme up, in the matter of Mr. Dubourg, as a person willfully and\nincorrigibly wrong.\n\n\"A coiner of false money, recommended as an honorable man by one of the\nfirst merchants in London!\" she exclaimed. \"We do some very eccentric\nthings in England, occasionally--but there is a limit to our national\nmadness, Madame Pratolungo, and you have reached it. Shall we have some\nmusic?\"\n\nShe spoke a little sharply. Mr. Dubourg was the hero of her romance. She\nresented--seriously resented--any attempt on my part to lower him in her\nestimation.\n\nI persisted in my unfavorable opinion of him, nevertheless. The question\nbetween us (as I might have told her) was a question of believing, or not\nbelieving, in the merchant of London. To her mind, it was a sufficient\nguarantee of his integrity that he was a rich man. To my mind (speaking\nas a good Socialist), that very circumstance told dead against him. A\ncapitalist is a robber of one sort, and a coiner is a robber of another\nsort. Whether the capitalist recommends the coiner, or the coiner the\ncapitalist, is all one to me. In either case (to quote the language of an\nexcellent English play) the honest people are the soft easy cushions on\nwhich these knaves repose and fatten. It was on the tip of my tongue to\nput this large and liberal view of the subject to Lucilla. But (alas!) it\nwas easy to see that the poor child was infected by the narrow prejudices\nof the class amid which she lived. How could I find it in my heart to run\nthe risk of a disagreement between us on the first day? No--it was not to\nbe done. I gave the nice pretty blind girl a kiss. And we went to the\npiano together. And I put off making a good Socialist of Lucilla till a\nmore convenient opportunity.\n\nWe might as well have left the piano unopened. The music was a failure.\n\nI played my best. From Mozart to Beethoven. From Beethoven to Schubert.\nFrom Schubert to Chopin. She listened with all the will in the world to\nbe pleased. She thanked me again and again. She tried, at my invitation,\nto play herself; choosing the familiar compositions which she knew by\near. No! The abominable Dubourg, having got the uppermost place in her\nmind, kept it. She tried, and tried, and tried--and could do nothing. His\nvoice was still in her ears--the only music which could possess itself of\nher attention that night. I took her place, and began to play again. She\nsuddenly snatched my hands off the keys. \"Is Zillah here?\" she whispered.\nI told her Zillah had left the room. She laid her charming head on my\nshoulder, and sighed hysterically. \"I can't help thinking of him,\" she\nburst out. \"I am miserable for the first time in my life--no! I am happy\nfor the first time in my life. Oh, what must you think of me! I don't\nknow what I am talking about. Why did you encourage him to speak to us? I\nmight never have heard his voice but for you.\" She lifted her head again\nwith a little shiver, and composed herself. One of her hands wandered\nhere and there over the keys of the piano, playing softly. \"His charming\nvoice!\" she whispered dreamily while she played. \"Oh, his charming\nvoice!\" She paused again. Her hand dropped from the piano, and took mine.\n\"Is this love?\" she said, half to herself, half to me.\n\nMy duty as a respectable woman lay clearly before me--my duty was to tell\nher a lie.\n\n\"It is nothing, my dear, but too much excitement and too much fatigue,\" I\nsaid. \"To-morrow you shall be my young lady again. To-night you must be\nonly my child. Come, and let me put you to bed.\"\n\nShe yielded with a weary sigh. Ah, how lovely she looked in her pretty\nnight-dress, on her knees at the bed-side--the innocent, afflicted\ncreature--saying her prayers!\n\nI am, let me own, an equally headlong woman at loving and hating. When I\nhad left her for the night, I could hardly have felt more tenderly\ninterested in her if she had been really a child of my own. You have met\nwith people of my sort--unless you are a very forbidding person\nindeed--who have talked to you in the most confidential manner of all\ntheir private affairs, on meeting you in a railway carriage, or sitting\nnext to you at a table-d'h\u00c3\u00b4te. For myself, I believe I shall go on\nrunning up sudden friendships with strangers to my dying day. Infamous\nDubourg! If I could have got into Browndown that night, I should have\nliked to have done to him what a Mexican maid of mine (at the Central\nAmerican period of my career) did to her drunken husband--who was a kind\nof peddler, dealing in whips and sticks. She sewed him strongly up one\nnight in the sheet, while he lay snoring off his liquor in bed; and then\nshe took his whole stock-in-trade out of the corner of the room, and\nbroke it on him, to the last article on sale, until he was beaten to a\njelly from head to foot.\n\nNot having this resource open to me, I sat myself down in my bedroom, to\nconsider--if the matter of Dubourg went any further--what it was my\nbusiness to do next.\n\nI have already mentioned that Lucilla and I had idled away the whole\nafternoon, woman-like, in talking of ourselves. You will best understand\nwhat course my reflections took, if I here relate the chief particulars\nwhich Lucilla communicated to me, concerning her own singular position in\nher father's house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SIXTH\n\nA Cage of Finches\n\nLARGE families are--as my experience goes--of two sorts. We have the\nfamilies whose members all admire each other. And we have the families\nwhose members all detest each other. For myself, I prefer the second\nsort. Their quarrels are their own affair; and they have a merit which\nthe first sort are never known to possess--the merit of being sometimes\nable to see the good qualities of persons who do not possess the\nadvantage of being related to them by blood. The families whose members\nall admire each other, are families saturated with insufferable conceit.\nYou happen to speak of Shakespeare, among these people, as a type of\nsupreme intellectual capacity. A female member of the family will not\nfail to convey to you that you would have illustrated your meaning far\nmore completely if you had referred her to \"dear Papa.\" You are out\nwalking with a male member of the household; and you say of a woman who\npasses, \"What a charming creature!\" Your companion smiles at your\nsimplicity, and wonders whether you have ever seen his sister when she is\ndressed for a ball. These are the families who cannot be separated\nwithout corresponding with each other every day. They read you extracts\nfrom their letters, and say, \"Where is the writer by profession who can\nequal this?\" They talk of their private affairs, in your presence--and\nappear to think that you ought to be interested too. They enjoy their own\njokes across you at table--and wonder how it is that you are not amused.\nIn domestic circles of this sort the sisters sit habitually on the\nbrothers' knees; and the husbands inquire into the wives' ailments, in\npublic, as unconcernedly as if they were closeted in their own room. When\nwe arrive at a more advanced stage of civilization, the State will supply\ncages for these intolerable people; and notices will be posted at the\ncorners of streets, \"Beware of Number Twelve: a family in a state of\nmutual admiration is hung up there!\"\n\nI gathered from Lucilla that the Finches were of the second order of\nlarge families, as mentioned above. Hardly one of the members of this\ndomestic group was on speaking terms with the other. And some of them had\nbeen separated for years, without once troubling Her Majesty's Post\nOffice to convey even the slightest expression of sentiment from one to\nthe other.\n\nThe first wife of Reverend Finch was a Miss Batchford. The members of her\nfamily (limited at the time of the marriage to her brother and her\nsister) strongly disapproved of her choice of a husband. The rank of a\nFinch (I laugh at these contemptible distinctions!) was decided, in this\ncase, to be not equal to the rank of a Batchford. Nevertheless, Miss\nmarried. Her brother and sister declined to be present at the ceremony.\nFirst quarrel.\n\nLucilla was born. Reverend Finch's elder brother (on speaking terms with\nno other member of the family) interfered with a Christian\nproposal--namely--to shake hands across the baby's cradle. Adopted by the\nmagnanimous Batchfords. First reconciliation.\n\nTime passed. Reverend Finch--then officiating in a poor curacy near a\ngreat manufacturing town--felt a want (the want of money); and took a\nliberty (the liberty of attempting to borrow of his brother-in-law). Mr.\nBatchford, being a rich man, regarded this overture, it is needless to\nsay, in the light of an insult. Miss Batchford sided with her brother.\nSecond quarrel.\n\nTime passed, as before. Mrs. Finch the first died. Reverend Finch's elder\nbrother (still at daggers drawn with the other members of the family)\nmade a second Christian proposal--namely--to shake hands across the\nwife's grave. Adopted once more by the bereaved Batchfords. Second\nreconciliation.\n\nAnother lapse of time. Reverend Finch, left a widower with one daughter,\nbecame personally acquainted with an inhabitant of the great city near\nwhich he ministered, who was also a widower with one daughter. The status\nof the parent, in this case--social-political-religious--was\nShoemaker-Radical-Baptist. Reverend Finch, still wanting money, swallowed\nit all; and married the daughter, with a dowry of three thousand pounds.\nThis proceeding alienated from him for ever, not the Batchfords only, but\nthe peacemaking elder brother as well. That excellent Christian ceased to\nbe on speaking terms now with his brother the clergyman, as well as with\nall the rest of the family. The complete isolation of Reverend Finch\nfollowed. Regularly every year did the second Mrs. Finch afford\nopportunities of shaking hands, not only over one cradle, but sometimes\nover two. Vain and meritorious fertility! Nothing came of it, but a kind\nof compromise. Lucilla, quite overlooked among the rector's\nrapidly-increasing second family, was allowed to visit her maternal uncle\nand aunt at stated periods in every year. Born, to all appearance with\nthe full possession of her sight, the poor child had become incurably\nblind before she was a year old. In all other respects, she presented a\nstriking resemblance to her mother. Bachelor uncle Batchford, and his old\nmaiden sister, both conceived the strongest affection for the child. \"Our\nniece Lucilla,\" they said, \"has justified our fondest hopes--she is a\nBatchford, not a Finch!\" Lucilla's father (promoted, by this time, to the\nrectory of Dimchurch) let them talk. \"Wait a bit, and money will come of\nit,\" was all he said. Truly money was wanted!--with fruitful Mrs. Finch\nmultiplying cradles, year after year, till the doctor himself (employed\non contract) got tired of it, and said one day, \"It is not true that\nthere is an end to everything: there is no end to the multiplying\ncapacity of Mrs. Finch.\"\n\nLucilla grew up from childhood to womanhood. She was twenty years old,\nbefore her father's expectations were realized, and the money came of it\nat last.\n\nUncle Batchford died a single man. He divided his fortune between his\nmaiden sister, and his niece. When she came of age, Lucilla was to have\nan income of fifteen hundred pounds a year--on certain conditions, which\nthe will set forth at great length. The effect of these conditions was\n(first) to render it absolutely impossible for Reverend Finch, under any\ncircumstances whatever, to legally inherit a single farthing of the\nmoney--and (secondly), to detach Lucilla from her father's household, and\nto place her under the care of her maiden aunt, so long as she remained\nunmarried, for a period of three months in every year.\n\nThe will avowed the object of this last condition in the plainest words.\n\"I die as I have lived\" (wrote uncle Batchford), \"a High Churchman and a\nTory. My legacy to my niece shall only take effect on these\nterms--namely--that she shall be removed at certain stated periods from\nthe Dissenting and Radical influences to which she is subjected under her\nfather's roof, and shall be placed under the care of an English\ngentlewoman who unites to the advantages of birth and breeding the\npossession of high and honorable principles\"--etcetera, etcetera. Can you\nconceive Reverend Finch's feelings, sitting, with his daughter by his\nside, among the company, while the will was read, and hearing this? He\ngot up, like a true Englishman, and made them a speech. \"Ladies and\ngentlemen,\" he said, \"I admit that I am a Liberal in politics, and that\nmy wife's family are Dissenters. As an example of the principles thus\nengendered in my household, I beg to inform you that my daughter accepts\nthis legacy with my full permission, and that I forgive Mr. Batchford.\"\nWith that, he walked out, with his daughter on his arm. He had heard\nenough, please to observe, to satisfy him that Lucilla (while she lived\nunmarried) could do what she liked with her income. Before they had got\nback to Dimchurch, Reverend Finch had completed a domestic arrangement\nwhich permitted his daughter to occupy a perfectly independent position\nin the rectory, and which placed in her father's pockets--as Miss Finch's\ncontribution to the housekeeping--five hundred a year.\n\n(Do you know what I felt when I heard this? I felt the deepest regret\nthat Finch of the liberal principles had not made a third with my poor\nPratolungo and me in Central America. With him to advise us, we should\nhave saved the sacred cause of Freedom without spending a single farthing\non it!)\n\nThe old side of the rectory, hitherto uninhabited, was put in order and\nfurnished--of course at Lucilla's expense. On her twenty-first birthday,\nthe repairs were completed; the first installment of the housekeeping\nmoney was paid; and the daughter was established, as an independent\nlodger, in her own father's house!\n\nIn order to thoroughly appreciate Finch's ingenuity, it is necessary to\nadd here that Lucilla had shown, as she grew up, an increasing dislike of\nliving at home. In her blind state, the endless turmoil of the children\ndistracted her. She and her step-mother did not possess a single sympathy\nin common. Her relations with her father were in much the same condition.\nShe could compassionate his poverty, and she could treat him with the\nforbearance and respect due to him from his child. As to really\nvenerating and loving him--the less said about that the better. Her\nhappiest days had been the days she spent with her uncle and aunt; her\nvisits to the Batchfords had grown to be longer and longer visits with\nevery succeeding year. If the father, in appealing to the daughter's\nsympathies, had not dexterously contrived to unite the preservation of\nher independence with the continuance of her residence under his roof,\nshe would, on coming of age, either have lived altogether with her aunt,\nor have set up an establishment of her own. As it was, the rector had\nsecured his five hundred a year, on terms acceptable to both sides--and,\nmore than that, he had got her safe under his own eye. For, remark, there\nwas one terrible possibility threatening him in the future--the\npossibility of Lucilla's marriage!\n\nSuch was the strange domestic position of this interesting creature, at\nthe time when I entered the house.\n\nYou will now understand how completely puzzled I was when I recalled what\nhad happened on the evening of my arrival, and when I asked myself--in\nthe matter of the mysterious stranger--what course I was to take next. I\nhad found Lucilla a solitary being--helplessly dependent in her blindness\non others--and, in that sad condition, without a mother, without a\nsister, without a friend even in whose sympathies she could take refuge,\nin whose advice she could trust. I had produced a first favorable\nimpression on her; I had won her liking at once, as she had won mine. I\nhad accompanied her on an evening walk, innocent of all suspicion of what\nwas going on in her mind. I had by pure accident enabled a stranger to\nintensify the imaginary interest which she felt in him, by provoking him\nto speak in her hearing for the first time. In a moment of hysterical\nagitation--and in sheer despair of knowing who else to confide in--the\npoor, foolish, blind, lonely girl had opened her heart to me. What was I\nto do?\n\nIf the case had been an ordinary one, the whole affair would have been\nsimply ridiculous.\n\nBut the case of Lucilla was not the case of girls in general.\n\nThe minds of the blind are, by cruel necessity, forced inward on\nthemselves. They live apart from us--ah, how hopelessly far apart!--in\ntheir own dark sphere, of which we know nothing. What relief could come\nto Lucilla from the world outside? None! It was part of her desolate\nliberty to be free to dwell unremittingly on the ideal creature of her\nown dream. Within the narrow limit of the one impression that it had been\npossible for her to derive of this man--the impression of the beauty of\nhis voice--her fancy was left to work unrestrained in the changeless\ndarkness of her life. What a picture! I shudder as I draw it. Oh, yes, it\nis easy, I know, to look at it the other way--to laugh at the folly of a\ngirl, who first excites her imagination about a total stranger; and then,\nwhen she hears him speak, falls in love with his voice! But add that the\ngirl is blind; that the girl lives habitually in the world of her own\nimagination; that the girl has nobody at home who can exercise a\nwholesome influence over her. Is there nothing pitiable in such a state\nof things as this? For myself, though I come of a light-hearted nation\nthat laughs at everything--I saw my own face looking horribly grave and\nold, as I sat before the glass that night, brushing my hair.\n\nI looked at my bed. Bah! what was the use of going to bed? She was her\nown mistress. She was perfectly free to take her next walk to Browndown\nalone! and to place herself, for all I knew to the contrary, at the mercy\nof a dishonorable and designing man. What was I? Only her companion. I\nhad no right to interfere--and yet, if anything happened, I should be\nblamed. It is so easy to say, \"You ought to have done something.\" Whom\ncould I consult? The worthy old nurse only held the position of servant.\nCould I address myself to the lymphatic lady with the baby in one hand,\nand the novel in the other? Absurd! her stepmother was not to be thought\nof. Her father? Judging by hearsay, I had not derived a favorable\nimpression of the capacity of Reverend Finch for interfering successfully\nin a matter of this sort. However, he was her father; and I could feel my\nway cautiously with him at first. Hearing Zillah moving about the\ncorridor, I went out to her. In the course of a little gossip, I\nintroduced the name of the master of the house. How was it I had not seen\nhim yet? For an excellent reason. He had gone to visit a friend at\nBrighton. It was then Tuesday. He was expected back on \"sermon-day\"--that\nis to say on Saturday in the same week.\n\nI returned to my room, a little out of temper. In this state my mind\nworks with wonderful freedom. I had another of my inspirations. Mr.\nDubourg had taken the liberty of speaking to me that evening. Good. I\ndetermined to go alone to Browndown the next morning, and take the\nliberty of speaking to Mr. Dubourg.\n\nWas this resolution solely inspired by my interest in Lucilla? Or had my\nown curiosity been all the time working under the surface, and\ninfluencing the course of my reflections unknown to myself? I went to bed\nwithout inquiring. I recommend you to go to bed without inquiring too.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SEVENTH\n\nDaylight View of the Man\n\nWHEN I put out my candle that night, I made a mistake--I trusted entirely\nto myself to wake in good time in the morning. I ought to have told\nZillah to call me.\n\nHours passed before I could close my eyes. It was broken rest when it\ncame, until the day dawned. Then I fell asleep at last in good earnest.\nWhen I woke, and looked at my watch, I was amazed to find that it was ten\no'clock.\n\nI jumped out of bed, and rang for the old nurse. Was Lucilla at home? No:\nshe had gone out for a little walk. By herself? Yes--by herself. In what\ndirection? Up the valley, towards Browndown.\n\nI instantly arrived at my own conclusion.\n\nShe had got the start of me--thanks to my laziness in sleeping away the\nprecious hours of the morning in bed. The one thing to do, was to follow\nher as speedily as possible. In half an hour more, _I_ was out for a\nlittle walk by myself--and (what do you think?) _my_ direction also was\nup the valley, towards Browndown.\n\nA pastoral solitude reigned round the lonely little house. I went on\nbeyond it, into the next winding of the valley. Not a human creature was\nto be seen. I returned to Browndown to reconnoiter. Ascending the rising\nground on which the house was built, I approached it from the back. The\nwindows were all open. I listened. (Do you suppose I felt scruples in\nsuch an emergency as this? Oh, pooh! pooh! who but a fool would have felt\nanything of the sort!) I listened with both my ears. Through a window at\nthe side of the house, I heard the sound of voices. Advancing noiselessly\non the turf, I heard the voice of Dubourg. He was answered by a woman.\nAha, I had caught her. Lucilla herself!\n\n\"Wonderful!\" I heard him say. \"I believe you have eyes in the ends of\nyour fingers. Take this, now--and try if you can tell me what it is.\"\n\n\"A little vase,\" she answered--speaking, I give you my word of honor, as\ncomposedly as if she had known him for years. \"Wait! what metal is it?\nSilver? No. Gold. Did you really make this yourself as well as the box?\"\n\n\"Yes. It is an odd taste of mine--isn't it?--to be fond of chasing in\ngold and silver. Years ago I met with a man in Italy, who taught me. It\namused me, then--and it amuses me now. When I was recovering from an\nillness last spring, I shaped that vase out of the plain metal, and made\nthe ornaments on it.\"\n\n\"Another mystery revealed!\" she exclaimed. \"Now I know what you wanted\nwith those gold and silver plates that came to you from London. Are you\naware of what a character you have got here? There are some of us who\nsuspect you of coining false money!\"\n\nThey both burst out laughing as gaily as a couple of children. I declare\nI wished myself one of the party! But no. I had my duty to do as a\nrespectable woman. My duty was to steal a little nearer, and see if any\nfamiliarities were passing between these two merry young people. One half\nof the open window was sheltered, on the outer side, by a Venetian blind.\nI stood behind the blind, and peeped in. (Duty! oh, dear me, painful, but\nnecessary duty!) Dubourg was sitting with his back to the window. Lucilla\nfaced me opposite to him. Her cheeks were flushed with pleasure. She held\nin her lap a pretty little golden vase. Her clever fingers were passing\nover it rapidly, exactly as they had passed, the previous evening, over\nmy face.\n\n\"Shall I tell you what the pattern is on your vase?\" she went on.\n\n\"Can you really do that?\"\n\n\"You shall judge for yourself. The pattern is made of leaves, with birds\nplaced among them, at intervals. Stop! I think I have felt leaves like\nthese on the old side of the rectory, against the wall. Ivy?\"\n\n\"Amazing! it _is_ ivy.\"\n\n\"The birds,\" she resumed. \"I shan't be satisfied till I have told you\nwhat the birds are. Haven't I got silver birds like them--only much\nlarger--for holding pepper, and mustard, and sugar, and so on. Owls!\" she\nexclaimed, with a cry of triumph. \"Little owls, sitting in ivy-nests.\nWhat a delightful pattern! I never heard of anything like it before.\"\n\n\"Keep the vase!\" he said. \"You will honor me, you will delight me, if you\nwill keep the vase.\"\n\nShe rose and shook her head--without giving him back the vase, however.\n\n\"I might take it, if you were not a stranger,\" she said. \"Why don't you\ntell us who you are, and what your reason is for living all by yourself\nin this dull place?\"\n\nHe stood before her, with his head down, and sighed bitterly.\n\n\"I know I ought to explain myself,\" he answered. \"I can't be surprised if\npeople are suspicious of me.\" He paused, and added very earnestly, \"I\ncan't tell it to _you._ Oh, no--not to _you!_\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"Don't ask me!\"\n\nShe felt for the table, with her ivory cane, and put the vase down on\nit--very unwillingly.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Dubourg,\" she said.\n\nHe opened the door of the room for her in silence. Waiting close against\nthe side of the house, I saw them appear under the porch, and cross the\nlittle walled enclosure in front. As she stepped out on the open turf\nbeyond, she turned, and spoke to him again.\n\n\"If you won't tell _me_ your secret,\" she said, \"will you tell it to some\none else? Will you tell it to a friend of mine?\"\n\n\"To what friend?\" he asked.\n\n\"To the lady whom you met with me last night.\"\n\nHe hesitated. \"I am afraid I offended the lady,\" he said.\n\n\"So much the more reason for your explaining yourself,\" she rejoined. \"If\nyou will only satisfy _her,_ I might ask you to come and see us--I might\neven take the vase.\" With that strong hint, she actually gave him her\nhand at parting. Her perfect self-possession, her easy familiarity with\nthis stranger--so bold, and yet so innocent--petrified me. \"I shall send\nmy friend to you this morning,\" she said imperiously, striking her cane\non the turf. \"I insist on your telling her the whole truth.\"\n\nWith that, she signed to him that he was to follow her no farther, and\nwent her way back to the village.\n\nDoes it not surprise you, as it surprised me? Instead of her blindness\nmaking her nervous in the presence of a man unknown to her, it appeared\nto have exactly the contrary effect. It made her fearless.\n\nHe stood on the spot where she had left him, watching her as she receded\nin the distance. His manner towards her, in the house and out of the\nhouse, had exhibited, it is only fair to say, the utmost consideration\nand respect. Whatever shyness there had been between them, was shyness\nentirely on his side. I had a short stuff dress on, which made no noise\nover the grass. I skirted the wall of the enclosure, and approached him\nunsuspected, from behind. \"The charming creature!\" he said to himself,\nstill following her with his eyes. As the words passed his lips, I struck\nhim smartly on the shoulder with my parasol.\n\n\"Mr. Dubourg,\" I said, \"I am waiting to hear the truth.\"\n\nHe started violently--and confronted me in speechless dismay; his color\ncoming and going like the color of a young girl. Anybody who understands\nwomen will understand that this behavior on his part, far from softening\nme towards him, only encouraged me to bully him.\n\n\"In your present position in this place, sir,\" I went on, \"do you think\nit honorable conduct on your part to decoy a young lady, to whom you are\na perfect stranger, into your house--a young lady who claims, in right of\nher sad affliction, even more than the usual forbearance and respect\nwhich a gentleman owes to her sex?\"\n\nHis shifting color settled, for the time, into an angry red.\n\n\"You are doing me a great injustice, ma'am,\" he answered. \"It is a shame\nto say that I have failed in respect to the young lady! I feel the\nsincerest admiration and compassion for her. Circumstances justify me in\nwhat I have done; I could not have acted otherwise. I refer you to the\nyoung lady herself.\"\n\nHis voice rose higher and higher--he was thoroughly offended with me.\nNeed I add (seeing the prospect not far off of _his_ bullying _me_), that\nI unblushingly shifted my ground, and tried a little civility next?\n\n\"If I have done you an injustice, sir, I ask your pardon,\" I answered.\n\"Having said so much, I have only to add that I shall be satisfied if I\nhear what the circumstances are, from yourself.\"\n\nThis soothed his offended dignity. His gentler manner began to show\nitself again.\n\n\"The truth is,\" he said, \"that I owe my introduction to the young lady to\nan ill-tempered little dog belonging to the people at the inn. The dog\nhad followed the person here who attends on me: and it startled the lady\nby flying out and barking at her as she passed this house. After I had\ndriven away the dog, I begged her to come in and sit down until she had\nrecovered herself. Am I to blame for doing that? I don't deny that I felt\nthe deepest interest in her and that I did my best to amuse her, while\nshe honored me by remaining in my house. May I ask if I have satisfied\nyou?\"\n\nWith the best will in the world to maintain my unfavorable opinion of\nhim, I was, by this time, fairly forced to acknowledge to myself that the\nopinion was wrong. His explanation was, in tone and manner as well as in\nlanguage, the explanation of a gentleman.\n\nAnd, besides--though he was a little too effeminate for my taste--he\nreally was such a handsome young man! His hair was of a fine bright\nchestnut color, with a natural curl in it. His eyes were of the lightest\nbrown I had ever seen--with a singularly winning gentle modest expression\nin them. As for his complexion--so creamy and spotless and fair--he had\nno right to it: it ought to have been a woman's complexion, or at least a\nboy's. He looked indeed more like a boy than a man: his smooth face was\nquite uncovered, either by beard, whisker, or mustache. If he had asked\nme, I should have guessed him (though he was really three years older) to\nhave been younger than Lucilla.\n\n\"Our acquaintance has begun rather oddly, sir,\" I said. \"You spoke\nstrangely to me last night; and I have spoken hastily to you this\nmorning. Accept my excuses--and let us try if we can't do each other\njustice in the end. I have something more to say to you before we part.\nWill you think me a very extraordinary woman, if I suggest that you may\nas well invite _me_ next, to take a chair in your house?\"\n\nHe laughed with the pleasantest good temper, and led the way in.\n\nWe entered the room in which he had received Lucilla; and sat down\ntogether on the two chairs near the window--with this difference--that I\ncontrived to possess myself of the seat which he had occupied, and so to\nplace him with his face to the light.\n\n\"Mr. Dubourg,\" I began, \"you will already have guessed that I overheard\nwhat Miss Finch said to you at parting?\"\n\nHe bowed, in silent acknowledgment that it was so--and began to toy\nnervously with the gold vase which Lucilla had left on the table.\n\n\"What do you propose to do?\" I went on. \"You have spoken of the interest\nyou feel in my young friend. If it is a true interest, it will lead you\nto merit her good opinion by complying with her request. Tell me plainly,\nif you please. Will you come and see us, in the character of a gentleman\nwho has satisfied two ladies that they can receive him as a neighbor and\na friend? Or will you oblige me to warn the rector of Dimchurch that his\ndaughter is in danger of permitting a doubtful character to force his\nacquaintance on her?\"\n\nHe put the vase back on the table, and turned deadly pale.\n\n\"If you knew what I have suffered,\" he said; \"if you had gone through\nwhat I have been compelled to endure--\" His voice failed him; his soft\nbrown eyes moistened; his head drooped. He said no more.\n\nIn common with all women, I like a man to _be_ a man. There was, to my\nmind, something weak and womanish in the manner in which this Dubourg met\nthe advance which I had made to him. He not only failed to move my\npity--he was in danger of stirring up my contempt.\n\n\"I too have suffered,\" I answered. \"I too have been compelled to endure.\nBut there is this difference between us. _My_ courage is not worn out. In\nyour place, if I knew myself to be an honorable man, I would not allow\nthe breath of suspicion to rest on me for an instant. Cost what it might,\nI would vindicate myself. I should be ashamed to cry--I should speak.\"\n\nThat stung him. He started up on his feet.\n\n\"Have _you_ been stared at by hundreds of cruel eyes?\" he burst out\npassionately. \"Have _you_ been pointed at, without mercy, wherever you\ngo? Have you been put in the pillory of the newspapers? Has the\nphotograph proclaimed _your_ infamous notoriety in all the shop-windows?\"\nHe dropped back into his chair, and wrung his hands in a frenzy. \"Oh, the\npublic!\" he exclaimed; \"the horrible public! I can't get away from\nthem--I can't hide myself, even here. You have had your stare at me, like\nthe rest,\" he cried, turning on me fiercely. \"I knew it when you passed\nme last night.\"\n\n\"I never saw you out of this place,\" I answered. \"As for the portraits of\nyou, whoever you may be, I know nothing about them. I was far too anxious\nand too wretched, to amuse myself by looking into shop-windows before I\ncame here. You, and your name, are equally strange to me. If you have any\nrespect for yourself, tell me who you are. Out with the truth, sir! You\nknow as well as I do that you have gone too far to stop.\"\n\nI seized him by the hand. I was wrought up by the extraordinary outburst\nthat had escaped him to the highest pitch of excitement: I was hardly\nconscious of what I said or did. At that supreme moment, we enraged, we\nmaddened each other. His hand closed convulsively on my hand. His eyes\nlooked wildly into mine.\n\n\"Do you read the newspapers?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have you seen----?\"\n\n\"I have _not_ seen the name of 'Dubourg'----\"\n\n\"'My name is not 'Dubourg.'\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nHe suddenly stooped over me; and whispered his name in my ear.\n\nIn my turn I started, thunderstruck, to my feet.\n\n\"Good God!\" I cried. \"You are the man who was tried for murder last\nmonth, and who was all but hanged, on the false testimony of a clock!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE EIGHTH\n\nThe Perjury of the Clock\n\nWE looked at one another in silence. Both alike, we were obliged to wait\na little and recover ourselves.\n\nI may occupy the interval by answering two questions which will arise in\nyour minds in this place. How did Dubourg come to be tried for his life?\nAnd what was the connection between this serious matter and the false\ntestimony of a clock?\n\nThe reply to both these inquiries is to be found in the story which I\ncall the Perjury of the Clock.\n\nIn briefly relating this curious incidental narrative (which I take from\na statement of the circumstances placed in my possession) I shall speak\nof our new acquaintance at Browndown--and shall continue to speak of him\nthroughout these pages--by his assumed name. In the first place, it was\nthe maiden name of his mother, and he had a right to take it if he\npleased. In the second place, the date of our domestic drama at Dimchurch\ngoes back as far as the years 'fifty-eight and 'fifty-nine; and real\nnames are (now that it is all over) of no consequence to anybody. With\n\"Dubourg\" we have begun. With \"Dubourg\" let us go on to the end.\n\nOn a summer evening, some years ago, a man was found murdered in a field\nnear a certain town in the West of England. The name of the field was,\n\"Pardon's Piece.\"\n\nThe man was a small carpenter and builder in the town, who bore an\nindifferent character. On the evening in question, a distant relative of\nhis, employed as farm-bailiff by a gentleman in the neighborhood,\nhappened to be passing a stile which led from the field into a road, and\nsaw a gentleman leaving the field by way of this stile, rather in a\nhurry. He recognized the gentleman as Mr. Dubourg.\n\nThe two passed each other on the road in opposite directions. After a\ncertain lapse of time--estimated as being half an hour--the farm-bailiff\nhad occasion to pass back along the same road. On reaching the stile, he\nheard an alarm raised, and entered the field to see what was the matter.\nHe found several persons running from the farther side of Pardon's Piece\ntowards a boy who was standing at the back of a cattle-shed, in a remote\npart of the enclosure, screaming with terror. At the boy's feet lay, face\ndownwards, the dead body of a man, with his head horribly beaten in. His\nwatch was under him, hanging out of his pocket by the chain. It had\nstopped--evidently in consequence of the concussion of its owner's fall\non it--at half-past eight. The body was still warm. All the other\nvaluables, like the watch, were left on it. The farm-bailiff instantly\nrecognized the man as the carpenter and builder mentioned above.\n\nAt the preliminary inquiry, the stoppage of the watch at half-past eight,\nwas taken as offering good circumstantial evidence that the blow which\nhad killed the man had been struck at that time.\n\nThe next question was--if any one had been seen near the body at\nhalf-past eight? The farm-bailiff declared that he had met Mr. Dubourg\nhastily leaving the field by the stile at that very time. Asked if he had\nlooked at his watch, he owned that he had not done so. Certain previous\ncircumstances which he mentioned as having impressed themselves on his\nmemory, enabled him to feel sure of the truth of his assertion, without\nhaving consulted his watch. He was pressed on this important point; but\nhe held to his declaration. At half-past eight he had seen Mr. Dubourg\nhurriedly leave the field. At half-past eight the watch of the murdered\nman had stopped.\n\nHad any other person been observed in or near the field at that time?\n\nNo witness could be discovered who had seen anybody else near the place.\nHad the weapon turned up, with which the blow had been struck? It had not\nbeen found. Was anyone known (robbery having plainly not been the motive\nof the crime) to have entertained a grudge against the murdered man? It\nwas no secret that he associated with doubtful characters, male and\nfemale; but suspicion failed to point to any one of them in particular.\n\nIn this state of things, there was no alternative but to request Mr.\nDubourg--well known in, and out of the town, as a young gentleman of\nindependent fortune; bearing an excellent character--to give some account\nof himself.\n\nHe immediately admitted that he had passed through the field. But in\ncontradiction to the farm-bailiff, he declared that _he_ had looked at\nhis watch at the moment before he crossed the stile, and that the time by\nit was exactly a quarter past eight. Five minutes later--that is to say\nten minutes before the murder had been committed, on the evidence of the\ndead man's watch--he had paid a visit to a lady living near Pardon's\nPiece; and had remained with her, until his watch, consulted once more on\nleaving the lady's house, informed him that it was a quarter to nine.\n\nHere was the defense called an \"alibi.\" It entirely satisfied Mr.\nDubourg's friends. To satisfy justice also, it was necessary to call the\nlady as a witness. In the meantime, another purely formal question was\nput to Mr. Dubourg. Did he know anything of the murdered man?\n\nWith some appearance of confusion, Mr. Dubourg admitted that he had been\ninduced (by a friend) to employ the man on some work. Further\ninterrogation extracted from him the following statement of facts.\n\nThat the work had been very badly done--that an exorbitant price had been\ncharged for it--that the man, on being remonstrated with, had behaved in\na grossly impertinent manner--that an altercation had taken place between\nthem--that Mr. Dubourg had seized the man by the collar of his coat, and\nhad turned him out of the house--that he had called the man an infernal\nscoundrel (being in a passion at the time), and had threatened to \"thrash\nhim within an inch of his life\" (or words to that effect) if he ever\npresumed to come near the house again; that he had sincerely regretted\nhis own violence the moment he recovered his self-possession; and,\nlastly, that, on his oath (the altercation having occurred six weeks\nago), he had never spoken to the man, or set eyes on the man since.\n\nAs the matter then stood, these circumstances were considered as being\nunfortunate circumstances for Mr. Dubourg--nothing more. He had his\n\"alibi\" to appeal to, and his character to appeal to; and nobody doubted\nthe result.\n\nThe lady appeared as witness.\n\nConfronted with Mr. Dubourg on the question of time, and forced to\nanswer, she absolutely contradicted him, on the testimony of the clock on\nher own mantelpiece. In substance, her evidence was simply this. She had\nlooked at her clock, when Mr. Dubourg entered the room; thinking it\nrather a late hour for a visitor to call on her. The clock (regulated by\nthe maker, only the day before) pointed to twenty-five minutes to nine.\nPractical experiment showed that the time required to walk the distance,\nat a rapid pace, from the stile to the lady's house, was just five\nminutes. Here then was the statement of the farm-bailiff (himself a\nrespectable witness) corroborated by another witness of excellent\nposition and character. The clock, on being examined next, was found to\nbe right. The evidence of the clock-maker proved that he kept the key,\nand that there had been no necessity to set the clock and wind it up\nagain, since he had performed both those acts on the day preceding Mr.\nDubourg's visit. The accuracy of the clock thus vouched for, the\nconclusion on the evidence was irresistible. Mr. Dubourg stood convicted\nof having been in the field at the time when the murder was committed; of\nhaving, by his own admission, had a quarrel with the murdered man, not\nlong before, terminating in an assault and a threat on his side; and,\nlastly, of having attempted to set up an alibi by a false statement of\nthe question of time. There was no alternative but to commit him to take\nhis trial at the Assizes, charged with the murder of the builder in\nPardon's Piece.\n\nThe trial occupied two days.\n\nNo new facts of importance were discovered in the interval. The evidence\nfollowed the course which it had taken at the preliminary\nexaminations--with this difference only, that it was more carefully\nsifted. Mr. Dubourg had the double advantage of securing the services of\nthe leading barrister on the circuit, and of moving the irrepressible\nsympathies of the jury, shocked at his position and eager for proof of\nhis innocence. By the end of the first day, the evidence had told against\nhim with such irresistible force, that his own counsel despaired of the\nresult. When the prisoner took his place in the dock on the second day,\nthere was but one conviction in the minds of the people in\ncourt--everybody said, \"The clock will hang him.\"\n\nIt was nearly two in the afternoon; and the proceedings were on the point\nof being adjourned for half an hour, when the attorney for the prisoner\nwas seen to hand a paper to the counsel for the defense.\n\nThe counsel rose, showing signs of agitation which roused the curiosity\nof the audience. He demanded the immediate hearing of a new witness;\nwhose evidence in the prisoner's favor he declared to be too important to\nbe delayed for a single moment. After a short colloquy between the judge\nand the banisters on either side, the court decided to continue the\nsitting.\n\nThe witness, appearing in the box, proved to be a young woman, in\ndelicate health. On the evening when the prisoner had paid his visit to\nthe lady, she was in that lady's service as housemaid. The day after, she\nhad been permitted (by previous arrangement with her mistress) to take a\nweek's holiday, and to go on a visit to her parents, in the west of\nCornwall. While there, she had fallen ill, and had not been strong enough\nsince to return to her employment. Having given this preliminary account\nof herself, the housemaid then stated the following extraordinary\nparticulars in relation to her mistress's clock.\n\nOn the morning of the day when Mr. Dubourg had called at the house, she\nhad been cleaning the mantelpiece. She had rubbed the part of it which\nwas under the clock with her duster, had accidentally struck the\npendulum, and had stopped it. Having once before done this, she had been\nseverely reproved. Fearing that a repetition of the offense, only the day\nafter the clock had been regulated by the maker, might lead perhaps to\nthe withdrawal of her leave of absence, she had determined to put matters\nright again, if possible, by herself.\n\nAfter poking under the clock in the dark, and failing to set the pendulum\ngoing again properly in that way, she next attempted to lift the clock,\nand give it a shake. It was set in a marble case, with a bronze figure on\nthe top; and it was so heavy that she was obliged to hunt for something\nwhich she could use as a lever. The thing proved to be not easy to find\non the spur of the moment. Having at last laid her hand on what she\nwanted, she contrived so to lift the clock a few inches and drop it again\non the mantelpiece, as to set it going once more.\n\nThe next necessity was of course to move the hands on. Here again she was\nmet by an obstacle. There was a difficulty in opening the glass-case\nwhich protected the dial. After uselessly searching for some instrument\nto help her, she got from the footman (without telling him what she\nwanted it for) a small chisel. With this, she opened the case--after\naccidentally scratching the brass frame of it--and set the hands of the\nclock by guess. She was flurried at the time; fearing that her mistress\nwould discover her. Later in the day, she found that she had\nover-estimated the interval of time that had passed while she was trying\nto put the clock right. She had, in fact, set it exactly _a quarter of an\nhour too fast._\n\nNo safe opportunity of secretly putting the clock right again had\noccurred, until the last thing at night. She had then moved the hands\nback to the right time. At the hour of the evening when Mr. Dubourg had\ncalled on her mistress, she positively swore that the clock was a quarter\nof an hour too fast. It had pointed, as her mistress had declared, to\ntwenty-five minutes to nine--the right time then being, as Mr. Dubourg\nhad asserted, twenty minutes past eight.\n\nQuestioned why she had refrained from giving this extraordinary evidence\nat the inquiry before the magistrate, she declared that in the remote\nCornish village to which she had gone the next day, and in which her\nillness had detained her from that time, nobody had heard of the inquiry\nor the trial. She would not have been then present to state the vitally\nimportant circumstances to which she had just sworn, if the prisoner's\ntwin-brother had not found her out on the previous day--had not\nquestioned her if she knew anything about the clock--and had not (hearing\nwhat she had to tell) insisted on her taking the journey with him to the\ncourt the next morning.\n\nThis evidence virtually decided the trial. There was a great burst of\nrelief in the crowded assembly when the woman's statement had come to an\nend.\n\nShe was closely cross-examined as a matter of course. Her character was\ninquired into; corroborative evidence (relating to the chisel and the\nscratches on the frame) was sought for and was obtained. The end of it\nwas that, at a late hour on the second evening, the jury acquitted the\nprisoner, without leaving their box. It was not too much to say that his\nlife had been saved by his brother. His brother alone had persisted, from\nfirst to last, in obstinately disbelieving the clock--for no better\nreason than that the clock was the witness which asserted the prisoner's\nguilt! He had worried everybody with incessant inquiries--he had\ndiscovered the absence of the housemaid, after the trial had begun--and\nhe had started off to interrogate the girl, knowing nothing, and\nsuspecting nothing; simply determined to persist in the one everlasting\nquestion with which he persecuted everybody belonging to the house: \"The\nclock is going to hang my brother; can you tell me anything about the\nclock?\"\n\nFour months later, the mystery of the crime was cleared up. One of the\ndisreputable companions of the murdered man confessed on his death-bed\nthat he had done the deed. There was nothing interesting or remarkable in\nthe circumstances. Chance which had put innocence in peril, had offered\nimpunity to guilt. An infamous woman; a jealous quarrel; and an absence\nat the moment of witnesses on the spot--these were really the commonplace\nmaterials which had composed the tragedy of Pardon's Piece.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE NINTH\n\nThe Hero of the Trial\n\n\"You have forced it out of me. Now you have had your way, never mind my\nfeelings--Go!\"\n\nThose were the first words the Hero of the Trial said to me, when he was\nable to speak again! He withdrew with a curious sullen resignation to the\nfarther end of the room. There he stood looking at me, as a man might\nhave looked who carried some contagion about him, and who wished to\npreserve a healthy fellow-creature from the peril of touching him.\n\n\"Why should I go?\" I asked.\n\n\"You are a bold woman,\" he said, \"to remain in the same room with a man\nwho has been pointed at as a murderer, and who has been tried for his\nlife.\"\n\nThe same unhealthy state of mind which had brought him to Dimchurch, and\nwhich had led him to speak to me as he had spoken on the previous\nevening, was, as I understood it, now irritating him against me as a\nperson who had made his own quick temper the means of entrapping him into\nletting out the truth. How was I to deal with a man in this condition? I\ndecided to perform the feat which you call in England, \"taking the bull\nby the horns.\"\n\n\"I see but one man here,\" I said. \"A man honorably acquitted of a crime\nwhich he was incapable of committing. A man who deserves my interest, and\nclaims my sympathy. Shake hands, Mr. Dubourg.\"\n\nI spoke to him in a good hearty voice, and I gave him a good hearty\nsqueeze. The poor, weak, lonely, persecuted young fellow dropped his head\non my shoulder like a child, and burst out crying.\n\n\"Don't despise me!\" he said, as soon as he had got his breath again. \"It\nbreaks a man down to have stood in the dock, and to have had hundreds of\nhard-hearted people staring at him in horror--without his deserving it.\nBesides, I have been very lonely, ma'am, since my brother left me.\"\n\nWe sat down again, side by side. He was the strangest compound of\nanomalies I had ever met with. Throw him into one of those passions in\nwhich he flamed out so easily--and you would have said, This is a tiger.\nWait till he had cooled down again to his customary mild temperature--and\nyou would have said with equal truth, This is a lamb.\n\n\"One thing rather surprises me, Mr. Dubourg,\" I went on. \"I can't quite\nunderstand----\"\n\n\"Don't call me Mr. Dubourg,\" he interposed. \"You remind me of the\ndisgrace which has forced me to change my name. Call me by my Christian\nname. It's a foreign name. You are a foreigner by your accent--you will\nlike me all the better for having a foreign name. I was christened\n'Oscar'--after my mother's brother: my mother was a Jersey woman. Call me\n'Oscar.'--What is it you don't understand?\"\n\n\"In your present situation,\" I resumed, \"I don't understand your brother\nleaving you here all by yourself.\"\n\nHe was on the point of flaming out again at that.\n\n\"Not a word against my brother!\" he exclaimed fiercely. \"My brother is\nthe noblest creature that God ever created! You must own that\nyourself--you know what he did at the trial. I should have died on the\nscaffold but for that angel. I insist on it that he is not a man. He is\nan angel!\"\n\n(I admitted that his brother was an angel. The concession instantly\npacified him.)\n\n\"People say there is no difference between us,\" he went on, drawing his\nchair companionably close to mine. \"Ah, people are so shallow!\nPersonally, I grant you, we are exactly alike. (You have heard that we\nare twins?) But there it ends, unfortunately for _me._ Nugent--(my\nbrother was christened Nugent after my father)--Nugent is a hero! Nugent\nis a genius. I should have died if he hadn't taken care of me after the\ntrial. I had nobody but him. We are orphans; we have no brothers or\nsisters. Nugent felt the disgrace even more than I felt it--but _he_\ncould control himself. It fell more heavily on him than it did on me.\nI'll tell you why. Nugent was in a fair way to make our family name--the\nname that we have been obliged to drop--famous all over the world. He is\na painter--a landscape painter. Have you never heard of him? Ah, you soon\nwill! Where do you think he has gone to? He has gone to the wilds of\nAmerica, in search of new subjects. He is going to found a school of\nlandscape painting. On an immense scale. A scale that has never been\nattempted yet. Dear fellow! Shall I tell you what he said when he left me\nhere? Noble words--I call them noble words. 'Oscar, I go to make our\nassumed name famous. You shall be honorably known--you shall be\nillustrious, as the brother of Nugent Dubourg.' Do you think I could\nstand in the way of such a career as that? After what he has sacrificed\nfor _me,_ could I let Such a Man stagnate here--for no better purpose\nthan to keep me company? What does it matter about _my_ feeling lonely?\nWho am I? Oh, if you had seen how he bore with the horrible notoriety\nthat followed us, after the trial! He was constantly stared at and\npointed at, for _me._ Not a word of complaint escaped him. He snapped his\nfingers at it. 'That for public opinion!' he said. What strength of\nmind--eh? From one place after another we moved and moved, and still\nthere were the photographs, and the newspapers, and the whole infamous\nstory ('romance in real life,' they called it), known beforehand to\neverybody. _He_ never lost heart. 'We shall find a place yet' (that was\nthe cheerful way he put it); 'you have nothing to do with it, Oscar; you\nare safe in my hands; I promise you exactly the place of refuge you\nwant.' It was he who got all the information, and found out this lonely\npart of England where you live. _I_ thought it pretty as we wandered\nabout the hills--it wasn't half grand enough for _him._ We lost\nourselves. I began to feel nervous. He didn't mind it a bit. 'You have Me\nwith you,' he said; 'My luck is always to be depended on. Mark what I\nsay! We shall stumble on a village!' You will hardly believe me--in ten\nminutes more, we stumbled, exactly as he had foretold, on this place. He\ndidn't leave me--when I had prevailed on him to go--without a\nrecommendation. He recommended me to the landlord of the inn here. He\nsaid, 'My brother is delicate; my brother wishes to live in retirement;\nyou will oblige me by looking after my brother.' Wasn't it kind? The\nlandlord seemed to be quite affected by it. Nugent cried when he took\nleave of me. Ah, what would I not give to have a heart like his and a\nmind like his! It's something--isn't it?--to have a face like him. I\noften say that to myself when I look in the glass. Excuse my running on\nin this way. When I once begin to talk of Nugent, I don't know when to\nleave off.\"\n\nOne thing, at any rate, was plainly discernible in this otherwise\ninscrutable young man. He adored his twin-brother.\n\nIt would have been equally clear to me that Mr. Nugent Dubourg deserved\nto be worshipped, if I could have reconciled to my mind his leaving his\nbrother to shift for himself in such a place as Dimchurch. I was obliged\nto remind myself of the admirable service which he had rendered at the\ntrial, before I could decide to do him the justice of suspending my\nopinion of him, in his absence. Having accomplished this act of\nmagnanimity, I took advantage of the first opportunity to change the\nsubject. The most tiresome information that I am acquainted with, is the\ninformation which tells us of the virtues of an absent person--when that\nabsent person happens to be a stranger.\n\n\"Is it true that you have taken Browndown for six months?\" I asked. \"Are\nyou really going to settle at Dimchurch?\"\n\n\"Yes--if you keep my secret,\" he answered. \"The people here know nothing\nabout me. Don't, pray don't, tell them who I am! You will drive me away,\nif you do.\"\n\n\"I must tell Miss Finch who you are,\" I said.\n\n\"No! no! no!\" he exclaimed eagerly. \"I can't bear the idea of her knowing\nit. I have been so horribly degraded. What will she think of me?\" He\nburst into another explosion of rhapsodies on the subject of\nLucilla--mixed up with renewed petitions to me to keep his story\nconcealed from everybody. I lost all patience with his want of common\nfortitude and common sense.\n\n\"Young Oscar, I should like to box your ears!\" I said. \"You are in a\nvillainously unwholesome state about this matter. Have you nothing else\nto think of? Have you no profession? Are you not obliged to work for your\nliving?\"\n\nI spoke, as you perceive, with some force of expression--aided by a\ncorresponding asperity of voice and manner.\n\nMr. Oscar Dubourg looked at me with the puzzled air of a man who feels an\noverflow of new ideas forcing itself into his mind. He modestly admitted\nthe degrading truth. From his childhood upwards, he had only to put his\nhand in his pocket, and to find the money there, without any preliminary\nnecessity of earning it first. His father had been a fashionable\nportrait-painter, and had married one of his sitters--an heiress. Oscar\nand Nugent had been left in the detestable position of independent\ngentlemen. The dignity of labor was a dignity unknown to these degraded\nyoung men. \"I despise a wealthy idler,\" I said to Oscar, with my\nrepublican severity. \"You want the ennobling influence of labor to make a\nman of you. Nobody has a right to be idle--nobody has a right to be rich.\nYou would be in a more wholesome state of mind about yourself, my young\ngentleman, if you had to earn your bread and cheese before you ate it.\"\n\nHe stared at me piteously. The noble sentiments which I had inherited\nfrom Doctor Pratolungo, completely bewildered Mr. Oscar Dubourg.\n\n\"Don't be angry with me,\" he said, in his innocent way. \"I couldn't eat\nmy cheese, if I did earn it. I can't digest cheese. Besides, I employ\nmyself as much as I can.\" He took his little golden vase from the table\nbehind him, and told me what I had already heard him tell Lucilla while I\nwas listening at the window. \"You would have found me at work this\nmorning,\" he went on, \"if the stupid people who send me my metal plates\nhad not made a mistake. The alloy, in the gold and silver both, is all\nwrong this time. I must return the plates to be melted again before I can\ndo anything with them. They are all ready to go back to-day, when the\ncart comes. If there are any laboring people here who want money, I'm\nsure I will give them some of mine with the greatest pleasure. It isn't\nmy fault, ma'am, that my father married my mother. And how could I help\nit if he left two thousand a year each to my brother and me?\"\n\nTwo thousand a year each to his brother and him! And the illustrious\nPratolungo had never known what it was to have five pounds sterling at\nhis disposal before his union with Me!\n\nI lifted my eyes to the ceiling. In my righteous indignation, I forgot\nLucilla and her curiosity about Oscar--I forgot Oscar and his horror of\nLucilla discovering who he was. I opened my lips to speak. In another\nmoment I should have launched my thunderbolts against the whole infamous\nsystem of modern society, when I was silenced by the most extraordinary\nand unexpected interruption that ever closed a woman's lips.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TENTH\n\nFirst Appearance of Jicks\n\nTHERE walked in, at the open door of the room--softly, suddenly, and\ncomposedly--a chubby female child, who could not possibly have been more\nthan three years old. She had no hat or cap on her head. A dirty pinafore\ncovered her from her chin to her feet. This amazing apparition advanced\ninto the middle of the room, holding hugged under one arm a ragged and\ndisreputable-looking doll; stared hard, first at Oscar, then at me;\nadvanced to my knees; laid the disreputable doll on my lap; and, pointing\nto a vacant chair at my side, claimed the rights of hospitality in these\nwords:\n\n\"Jicks will sit down.\"\n\nHow was it possible, under these circumstances, to attack the infamous\nsystem of modern society? It was only possible to kiss \"Jicks.\"\n\n\"Do you know who this is?\" I inquired, as I lifted our visitor on to the\nchair.\n\nOscar burst out laughing. Like me, he now saw this mysterious young lady\nfor the first time. Like me, he wondered what the extraordinary nick-name\nunder which she had presented herself could possibly mean.\n\nWe looked at the child. The child--with its legs stretched out straight\nbefore it, terminating in a pair of little dusty boots with holes in\nthem--lifted its large round eyes, overshadowed by a penthouse of\nunbrushed flaxen hair; looked gravely at us in return; and made a second\ncall on our hospitality, as follows:\n\n\"Jicks will have something to drink.\"\n\nWhile Oscar ran into the kitchen for some milk, I succeeded in\ndiscovering the identity of \"Jicks.\"\n\nSomething--I cannot well explain what--in the manner in which the child\nhad drifted into the room with her doll, reminded me of the lymphatic\nlady of the rectory, drifting backwards and forwards with the baby in one\nhand and the novel in the other. I took the liberty of examining\n\"Jicks's\" pinafore, and discovered the mark in one corner:--\"Selina\nFinch.\" Exactly as I had supposed, here was a member of Mrs. Finch's\nnumerous family. Rather a young member, as it struck me, to be wandering\nhatless round the environs of Dimchurch, all by herself.\n\nOscar returned with the milk in a mug. The child--insisting on taking the\nmug into her own hands--steadily emptied it to the last drop--recovered\nher breath with a gasp--looked at me with a white mustache of milk on her\nupper lip--and announced the conclusion of her visit, in these terms:\n\n\"Jicks will get down again.\"\n\nI deposited our young friend on the floor. She took her doll, and stood\nfor a moment deep in thought. What was she going to do next? We were not\nkept long in suspense. She suddenly put her little hot fat hand into\nmine, and tried to pull me after her out of the room.\n\n\"What do you want?\" I asked.\n\nJicks answered in one untranslatable compound word:\n\n\"Man-Gee-gee.\"\n\nI suffered myself to be pulled out of the room--to see \"Man-Gee-gee,\" to\nplay \"Man-Gee-gee,\" or to eat \"Man-Gee-gee,\" it was impossible to tell\nwhich. I was pulled along the passage--I was pulled out to the front\ndoor. There--having approached the house inaudibly to us, over the\ngrass--stood the horse, cart, and man, waiting to take the case of gold\nand silver plates back to London. I looked at Oscar, who had followed me.\nWe now understood, not only the masterly compound word of Jicks\n(signifying man and horse, and passing over cart as unimportant), but the\npolite attention of Jicks in entering the house to inform us, after a\nrest and a drink, of a circumstance which had escaped our notice. The\ndriver of the cart had, on his own acknowledgment, been investigated and\nquestioned by this extraordinary child; strolling up to the door of\nBrowndown to see what he was doing there. Jicks was a public character at\nDimchurch. The driver knew all about her. She had been nicknamed \"Gipsy\"\nfrom her wandering habits, and had shortened the name in her own dialect,\ninto \"Jicks.\" There was no keeping her in at the rectory, try how you\nmight: they had long since abandoned the effort in despair. Sooner or\nlater, she turned up again--or somebody brought her back--or one of the\nsheep-dogs found her asleep under a bush, and gave the alarm. \"What goes\non in that child's head,\" said the driver, regarding Jicks with a sort of\nsuperstitious admiration, \"the Lord only knows. She has a will of her\nown, and a way of her own. She _is_ a child; and she _aint_ a child. At\nthree years of age, she's a riddle none of us can guess. And that's the\nlong and the short of what I know about her.\"\n\nWhile this explanation was in progress, the carpenter who had nailed up\nthe case, and the carpenter's son, accompanying him, joined us in front\nof the house. They followed Oscar in, and came out again, bearing the\nheavy burden of precious metal--more than one man could conveniently\nlift--between them.\n\nThe case deposited in the cart, carpenter senior and carpenter junior got\nin after it, wanting \"a lift\" to Brighton.\n\nCarpenter senior, a big burly man, made a joke. \"It's a lonely country\nbetween this and Brighton, sir,\" he said to Oscar. \"Three of us will be\nnone too many to see your precious packing-case safe into the railway\nstation.\" Oscar took it seriously. \"Are there any robbers in this\nneighborhood?\" he asked. \"Lord love you, sir!\" said the driver, \"robbers\nwould starve in these parts; we have got nothing worth thieving here.\"\nJicks--still watching the proceedings with an interest which allowed no\ndetail to escape unnoticed--assumed the responsibility of starting the\nmen on their journey. The odd child waved her chubby hand imperiously to\nher friend the driver, and cried in her loudest voice, \"Away!\" The driver\ntouched his hat with comic respect. \"All right, miss--time's money, aint\nit?\" He cracked his whip, and the cart rolled off noiselessly over the\nthick close turf of the South Downs.\n\nIt was time for me to go back to the rectory, and to restore the\nwandering Jicks, for the time being, to the protection of home. I\nreturned to Oscar, to say good-bye.\n\n\"I wish I was going back with you,\" he said.\n\n\"You will be as free as I am to come and to go at the rectory,\" I\nanswered, \"when they know what has passed this morning between you and\nme. In your own interests, I am determined to tell them who you are. You\nhave nothing to fear, and everything to gain, by my speaking out. Clear\nyour mind of fancies and suspicions that are unworthy of you. By\nto-morrow we shall be good neighbors; by the end of the week we shall be\ngood friends. For the present, as we say in France, _au revoir!_\"\n\nI turned to take Jicks by the hand. While I had been speaking to Oscar\nthe child had slipped away from me. Not a sign of her was to be seen.\n\nBefore we could stir a step to search for our lost Gipsy, her voice\nreached our ears, raised shrill and angry in the regions behind us, at\nthe side of the house.\n\n\"Go away!\" we heard the child cry out impatiently. \"Ugly men, go away!\"\n\nWe turned the corner, and discovered two shabby strangers, resting\nthemselves against the side wall of the house. Their cadaverous faces,\ntheir brutish expressions, and their frowzy clothes, proclaimed them, to\nmy eye, as belonging to the vilest blackguard type that the civilized\nearth has yet produced--the blackguard of London growth. There they\nlounged, with their hands in their pockets and their backs against the\nwall, as if they were airing themselves on the outer side of a\npublic-house--and there stood Jicks, with her legs planted wide apart on\nthe turf, asserting the rights of property (even at that early age!) and\nordering the rascals off.\n\n\"What are you doing there?\" asked Oscar sharply.\n\nOne of the men appeared to be on the point of making an insolent answer.\nThe other--the younger and the viler-looking villain of the two--checked\nhim, and spoke first.\n\n\"We've had a longish walk, sir,\" said the fellow, with an impudent\nassumption of humility; \"and we've took the liberty of resting our backs\nagainst your wall, and feasting our eyes on the beauty of your young lady\nhere.\"\n\nHe pointed to the child. Jicks shook her fist at him, and ordered him off\nmore fiercely than ever.\n\n\"There's an inn in the village,\" said Oscar. \"Rest there, if you\nplease--my house is not an inn.\"\n\nThe elder man made a second effort to speak, beginning with an oath. The\nyounger checked him again.\n\n\"Shut up, Jim!\" said the superior blackguard of the two. \"The gentleman\nrecommends the tap at the inn. Come and drink the gentleman's health.\" He\nturned to the child, and took off his hat to her with a low bow. \"Wish\nyou good morning, Miss! You're just the style, you are, that I admire.\nPlease don't engage yourself to be married till I come back.\"\n\nHis savage companion was so tickled by this delicate pleasantry that he\nburst suddenly into a roar of laughter. Arm in arm, the two ruffians\nwalked off together in the direction of the village. Our funny little\nJicks became a tragic and terrible Jicks, all on a sudden. The child\nresented the insolence of the two men as if she really understood it. I\nnever saw so young a creature in such a furious passion before. She\npicked up a stone, and threw it at them before I could stop her. She\nscreamed, and stamped her tiny feet alternately on the ground, till she\nwas purple in the face. She threw herself down, and rolled in fury on the\ngrass. Nothing pacified her but a rash promise of Oscar's (which he was\ndestined to hear of for many a long day afterwards) to send for the\npolice, and to have the two men soundly beaten for daring to laugh at\nJicks. She got up from the ground, and dried her eyes with her knuckles,\nand fixed a warning look on Oscar. \"Mind!\" said this curious child, with\nher bosom still heaving under the dirty pinafore, \"the men are to be\nbeaten. And Jicks is to see it.\"\n\nI said nothing to Oscar, at the time, but I felt some secret uneasiness\non the way home--an uneasiness inspired by the appearance of the two men\nin the neighborhood of Browndown.\n\nIt was impossible to say how long they might have been lurking about the\noutside of the house, before the child discovered them. They might have\nheard, through the open window, what Oscar had said to me on the subject\nof his plates of precious metal; and they might have seen the heavy\npacking-case placed in the cart. I felt no apprehension about the safe\narrival of the case at Brighton; the three men in the cart were men\nenough to take good care of it. My fears were for the future. Oscar was\nliving, entirely by himself, in a lonely house, more than half a mile\ndistant from the village. His fancy for chasing in the precious metals\nmight have its dangers, as well as its attractions, if it became known\nbeyond the pastoral limits of Dimchurch. Advancing from one suspicion to\nanother, I asked myself if the two men had roamed by mere accident into\nour remote part of the world--or whether they had deliberately found\ntheir way to Browndown with a purpose in view. Having this doubt in my\nmind, and happening to encounter the old nurse, Zillah, in the garden as\nI entered the rectory gates with my little charge, I put the question to\nher plainly, \"Do you see many strangers at Dimchurch?\"\n\n\"Strangers?\" repeated the old woman. \"Excepting yourself, ma'am, we see\nno strangers here, from one year's end to another.\"\n\nI determined to say a warning word to Oscar before his precious metals\nwere sent back to Browndown.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE ELEVENTH\n\nBlind Love\n\nLUCILLA was at the piano when I entered the sitting-room.\n\n\"I wanted you of all things,\" she said. \"I have sent all over the house\nin search of you. Where have you been?\"\n\nI told her.\n\nShe sprang to her feet with a cry of delight.\n\n\"You have persuaded him to trust you--you have discovered everything. You\nonly said 'I have been at Browndown'--and I heard it in your voice. Out\nwith it! out with it!\"\n\nShe never moved--she seemed hardly to breathe--while I was telling her\nall that had passed at the interview between Oscar and me. As soon as I\nhad done, she got up in a violent hurry--flushed and eager--and made\nstraight for her bedroom door.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" I asked.\n\n\"I want my hat and my stick,\" she answered.\n\n\"You are going out?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Can you ask the question? To Browndown of course!\"\n\nI begged her to wait a moment, and hear a word or two that I had to say.\nIt is, I suppose, almost needless to add that my object in speaking to\nher was to protest against the glaring impropriety of her paying a second\nvisit, in one day, to a man who was a stranger to her. I declared, in the\nplainest terms, that such a proceeding would be sufficient, in the\nestimation of any civilized community, to put her reputation in peril.\nThe result of my interference was curious and interesting in the extreme.\nIt showed me that the virtue called Modesty (I am not speaking of\nDecency, mind) is a virtue of purely artificial growth; and that the\nsuccessful cultivation of it depends in the first instance, not on the\ninfluence of the tongue, but on the influence of the eye.\n\nSuppose the case of an average young lady (conscious of feeling a first\nlove) to whom I might have spoken in the sense that I have just\nmentioned--what would she have done?\n\nShe would assuredly have shown some natural and pretty confusion, and\nwould, in all human probability, have changed color more or less while\nshe was listening to me. Lucilla's charming face revealed but one\nexpression--an expression of disappointment, slightly mixed perhaps with\nsurprise. I believed her to be then, what I knew her to be afterwards, as\npure a creature as ever walked the earth. And yet, of the natural and\nbecoming confusion, of the little inevitable feminine changes of color\nwhich I had expected to see, not so much as a vestige appeared--and this,\nremember, in the case of a person of unusually sensitive and impulsive\nnature: quick, on the most trifling occasions, to feel and to express its\nfeeling in no ordinary degree.\n\nWhat did it mean?\n\nIt meant that here was one strange side shown to me of the terrible\naffliction that darkened her life. It meant that modesty is essentially\nthe growth of our own consciousness of the eyes of others judging us--and\nthat blindness is never bashful, for the one simple reason that blindness\ncannot see. The most modest girl in existence is bolder with her lover in\nthe dark than in the light. The female model who \"sits\" for the first\ntime in a drawing academy, and who shrinks from the ordeal, is persuaded,\nin the last resort, to enter the students' room by having a bandage bound\nover her eyes. My poor Lucilla had always the bandage over her eyes. My\npoor Lucilla was never to meet her lover in the light. She had grown up\nwith the passions of a woman--and yet, she had never advanced beyond the\nfearless and primitive innocence of a child. Ah, if ever there was a\nsacred charge confided to any mortal creature, here surely was a sacred\ncharge confided to Me! I could not endure to see the poor pretty blind\nface turned so insensibly towards mine, after such words as I had just\nsaid to her. She was standing within my reach. I took her by the arm, and\nmade her sit on my knee. \"My dear!\" I said, very earnestly, \"you must not\ngo to him again to-day.\"\n\n\"I have got so much to say to him,\" she answered impatiently, \"I want to\ntell him how deeply I feel for him, and how anxious I am to make his life\na happier one if I can.\"\n\n\"My dear Lucilla! you can't say this to a young man. It is as good as\ntelling him, in plain words, that you are fond of him!\"\n\n\"I _am_ fond of him.\"\n\n\"Hush! hush! Keep it to yourself, until you are sure that _he_ is fond of\n_you._ It is the man's place, my love--not the woman's--to own the truth\nfirst in matters of this sort.\"\n\n\"That is very hard on the women. If they feel it first, they ought to own\nit first.\" She paused for a moment, considering with herself--and\nabruptly got off my knee. \"I _must_ speak to him!\" she burst out. \"I\n_must_ tell him that I have heard his story, and that I think all the\nbetter of him after it, instead of the worse!\"\n\nShe was again on her way to get her hat. My only chance of stopping her\nwas to invent a compromise.\n\n\"Write him a note,\" I said--and then suddenly remembered that she was\nblind. \"You shall dictate,\" I added; \"and I will hold the pen. Be content\nwith that for to-day. For my sake, Lucilla!\"\n\nShe yielded--not very willingly, poor thing. But she jealously declined\nto let me hold the pen.\n\n\"My first note to him must be all written by me,\" she said. \"I can\nwrite--in my own roundabout way. It's long and tiresome; but still I can\ndo it. Come and see.\"\n\nShe led the way to a writing-table in a corner of the room, and sat for\nawhile with the pen in her hand, thinking. Her irresistible smile broke\nsuddenly like a glow of light over her \"Ah!\" she exclaimed, \"I know how\nto tell him what I think.\"\n\nGuiding the pen in her right hand with the fingers of her left she wrote\nslowly, in large childish characters, these words:--\"DEAR MR. OSCAR,--I\nhave heard all about you. Please send the little gold vase.--Your friend,\nLUCILLA.\"\n\nShe enclosed and directed the letter, and clapped her hands for joy. \"He\nwill know what _that_ means!\" she said gaily.\n\nIt was useless to attempt making a second remonstrance. I rang the bell,\nunder protest (imagine her receiving a present from a gentleman to whom\nshe had spoken for the first time that morning!)--and the groom was sent\noff to Browndown with the letter. In making this concession, I privately\nsaid to myself, \"I shall keep a tight hand over Oscar; he is the\nmanageable person of the two!\"\n\nThe interval before the return of the groom was not an easy interval to\nfill up. I proposed some music. Lucilla was still too full of her new\ninterest to be able to give her attention to anything else. She suddenly\nremembered that her father and her step-mother ought both to be informed\nthat Mr. Dubourg was a perfectly presentable person at the rectory: she\ndecided on writing to her father.\n\nOn this occasion, she made no difficulty about permitting me to hold the\npen, while she told me what to write. We produced between us rather a\nflighty, enthusiastic, high-flown sort of letter. I felt by no means sure\nthat we should raise a favorable impression of our new neighbor in the\nmind of Reverend Finch. That was, however, not my affair. I appeared to\nexcellent advantage in the matter, as the judicious foreign lady who had\ninsisted on making inquiries. For the rest, it was a point of honor with\nme--writing for a person who was blind--not to change a single word in\nthe sentences which Lucilla dictated to me. The letter completed, I wrote\nthe address of the house in Brighton at which Mr. Finch then happened to\nbe staying; and I was next about to close the envelope in due\ncourse--when Lucilla stopped me.\n\n\"Wait a little,\" she said. \"Don't close the letter yet.\"\n\nI wondered why the envelope was to be left open, and why Lucilla looked a\nlittle confused when she forbade me to close it. Another unexpected\nrevelation of the influence of their affliction on the natures of the\nblind, was waiting to enlighten me on those two points.\n\nAfter consultation between us, it had been decided, at Lucilla's express\nrequest, that I should inform Mrs. Finch that the mystery at Browndown\nwas now cleared up. Lucilla openly owned to having no great relish for\nthe society of her step-mother, or for the duty invariably devolving on\nanybody who was long in the company of that fertile lady, of either\nfinding her handkerchief or holding her baby. A duplicate key of the door\nof communication between the two sides of the house was given to me; and\nI left the room.\n\nBefore performing my errand, I went for a minute into my bedchamber to\nput away my hat and parasol. Returning into the corridor, and passing the\ndoor of the sitting-room, I found that it had been left ajar by some one\nwho had entered after I had left; and I heard Lucilla's voice say, \"Take\nthat letter out of the envelope, and read it to me.\"\n\nI pursued my way along the passage--very slowly, I own--and I heard the\nfirst sentences of the letter which I had written under Lucilla's\ndictation, read aloud to her in the old nurse's voice. The incurable\nsuspicion of the blind--always abandoned to the same melancholy distrust\nof the persons about them; always doubting whether some deceit is not\nbeing practiced on them by the happy people who can see--had urged\nLucilla, even in the trifling matter of the letter, to put me to the\ntest, behind my back. She was using Zillah's eyes to make sure that I had\nreally written all that she had dictated to me--exactly as, on many an\nafter occasion, she used my eyes to make sure of Zillah's complete\nperformance of tasks allotted to her in the house. No experience of the\nfaithful devotion of those who live with them ever thoroughly satisfies\nthe blind. Ah, poor things, always in the dark! always in the dark!\n\nIn opening the door of communication, it appeared as if I had also opened\nall the doors of all the bedchambers in the rectory. The moment I stepped\ninto the passage, out popped the children from one room after another,\nlike rabbits out of their burrows.\n\n\"Where is your mamma?\" I asked.\n\nThe rabbits answered by one universal shriek, and popped back again into\ntheir burrows.\n\nI went down the stairs to try my luck on the ground floor. The window on\nthe landing had a view over the front garden. I looked out, and saw the\nirrepressible Arab of the family, our small chubby Jicks, wandering in\nthe garden, all by herself; evidently on the watch for her next\nopportunity of escaping from the house. This curious little creature\ncared nothing for the society of the other children. Indoors, she sat\ngravely retired in corners, taking her meals (whenever she could) on the\nfloor. Out of doors, she roamed till she could walk no longer, and then\nlay down anywhere, like a little animal, to sleep. She happened to look\nup as I stood at the window. Seeing me, she waved her hand indicatively\nin the direction of the rectory gate. \"What is it?\" I asked. The Arab\nanswered, \"Jicks wants to get out.\"\n\nAt the same moment, the screaming of a baby below, informed me that I was\nin the near neighborhood of Mrs. Finch.\n\nI advanced towards the noise, and found myself standing before the open\ndoor of a large store-room at the extreme end of the passage. In the\nmiddle of the room (issuing household commodities to the cook) sat Mrs.\nFinch. She was robed this time in a petticoat and a shawl; and she had\nthe baby and the novel laid together flat on their backs in her lap.\n\n\"Eight pounds of soap? Where does it all go to I wonder!\" groaned Mrs.\nFinch to the accompaniment of the baby's screams. \"Five pounds of soda\nfor the laundry? One would think we did the washing for the whole\nvillage. Six pounds of candles? You must eat candles, like the Russians:\nwho ever heard of burning six pounds of candles in a week? Ten pounds of\nsugar? Who gets it all? I never taste sugar from one year's end to\nanother. Waste, nothing but waste.\" Here Mrs. Finch looked my way, and\nsaw me at the door. \"Oh? Madame Pratolungo? How d'ye do? Don't go\naway--I've just done. A bottle of blacking? My shoes are a disgrace to\nthe house. Five pounds of rice? If I had Indian servants, five pounds of\nrice would last them for a year. There! take the things away into the\nkitchen. Excuse my dress, Madame Pratolungo. How _am_ I to dress, with\nall I have got to do? What do you say? My time must indeed be fully\noccupied? Ah, that's just where it is! When you have lost half an hour in\nthe morning, and can't pick it up again--to say nothing of having the\nstore-room on your mind, and the children's dinner late, and the baby\nfractious--one slips on a petticoat and a shawl, and gives it up in\ndespair. What _can_ I have done with my handkerchief? Would you mind\nlooking among those bottles behind you? Oh, here it is, under the baby.\nMight I trouble you to hold my book for one moment? I think the baby will\nbe quieter if I put him the other way.\" Here Mrs. Finch turned the baby\nover on his stomach, and patted him briskly on the back. At this change\nin his circumstances, the unappeasable infant only roared louder than\never. His mother appeared to be perfectly unaffected by the noise. This\nresigned domestic martyr looked placidly up at me, as I stood before her,\nbewildered, with the novel in my hand. \"Ah, that's a very interesting\nstory,\" she went on. \"Plenty of love in it, you know. You have come for\nit, haven't you? I remember I promised to lend it to you yesterday.\"\nBefore I could answer the cook appeared again, in search of more\nhousehold commodities. Mrs. Finch repeated the woman's demands, one by\none as she made them, in tones of despair. \"Another bottle of vinegar? I\nbelieve you water the garden with vinegar! More starch? The Queen's\nwashing, I'm firmly persuaded, doesn't come to so much as ours.\nSandpaper? Sandpaper means wastepaper in this profligate house. I shall\ntell your master. I really _can_ NOT make the housekeeping money last at\nthis rate. Don't go, Madame Pratolungo! I shall have done directly. What!\nYou must go! Oh, then, put the book back on my lap, please--and look\nbehind that sack of flour. The first volume slipped down there this\nmorning, and I haven't had time to pick it up since. (Sandpaper! Do you\nthink I'm made of sandpaper!) Have you found the first volume? Ah, that's\nit. All over flour! there's a hole in the sack I suppose. Twelve sheets\nof sandpaper used in a week! What for? I defy any of you to tell me what\nfor. Waste! waste! shameful sinful waste!\" At this point in Mrs. Finch's\nlamentations, I made my escape with the book, and left the subject of\nOscar Dubourg to be introduced at a fitter opportunity. The last words I\nheard, through the screams of the baby, as I ascended the stairs, were\nwords still relating to the week's prodigal consumption of sandpaper. Let\nus drop a tear, if you please, over the woes of Mrs. Finch, and leave the\nBritish matron apostrophizing domestic economy in the odorous seclusion\nof her own storeroom.\n\nI had just related to Lucilla the failure of my expedition to the other\nside of the house, when the groom returned, bringing with him the gold\nvase, and a letter.\n\nOscar's answer was judiciously modeled to imitate the brevity of\nLucilla's note. \"You have made me a happy man again. When may I follow\nthe vase?\" There, in two sentences, was the whole letter.\n\nI had another discussion with Lucilla, relating to the propriety of our\nreceiving Oscar in Reverend Finch's absence. It was only possible to\npersuade her to wait until she had at least heard from her father, by\nconsenting to take another walk towards Browndown the next morning. This\nnew concession satisfied her. She had received his present; she had\nexchanged letters with him--that was enough to content her for the time.\n\n\"Do you think he is getting fond of me?\" she asked, the last thing at\nnight; taking her gold vase to bed with her, poor dear--exactly as she\nmight have taken a new toy to bed with her when she was a child. \"Give\nhim time, my love,\" I answered. \"It isn't everybody who can travel at\nyour pace in such a serious matter as this.\" My banter had no effect upon\nher. \"Go away with your candle,\" she said. \"The darkness makes no\ndifference to _me._ I can see him in my thoughts.\" She nestled her head\ncomfortably on the pillows, and tapped me saucily on the cheek, as I bent\nover her. \"Own the advantage I have over you now,\" she said. \"_You_ can't\nsee at night without your candle. _I_ could go all over the house, at\nthis moment, without making a false step anywhere.\"\n\nWhen I left her that night, I sincerely believe \"poor Miss Finch\" was the\nhappiest woman in England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TWELFTH\n\nMr. Finch smells Money\n\nA DOMESTIC alarm deferred for some hours our proposed walk to Browndown.\n\nThe old nurse, Zillah, was taken ill in the night. She was so little\nrelieved by such remedies as we were able to apply, that it became\nnecessary to summon the doctor in the morning. He lived at some distance\nfrom Dimchurch; and he had to send back to his own house for the\nmedicines required. As a necessary result of these delays, it was close\non one o'clock in the afternoon before the medical remedies had their\neffect, and the nurse was sufficiently recovered to permit of our leaving\nher in the servant's care.\n\nWe had dressed for our walk (Lucilla being ready long before I was), and\nhad got as far as the garden gate on our way to Browndown--when we heard,\non the other side of the wall, a man's voice, pitched in superbly deep\nbass tones, pronouncing these words:\n\n\"Believe me, my dear sir, there is not the least difficulty. I have only\nto send the cheque to my bankers at Brighton.\"\n\nLucilla started, and caught hold of me by the arm.\n\n\"My father!\" she exclaimed in the utmost astonishment. \"Who is he talking\nto?\"\n\nThe key of the gate was in my possession. \"What a grand voice your father\nhas got!\" I said, as I took the key out of my pocket. I opened the gate.\nThere, confronting us on the threshold, arm in arm, as if they had known\neach other from childhood, stood Lucilla's father, and--Oscar Dubourg!\n\nReverend Finch opened the proceedings by folding his daughter\naffectionately in his arms.\n\n\"My dear child!\" he said, \"I received your letter--your most interesting\nletter--this morning. The moment I read it I felt that I owed a duty to\nMr. Dubourg. As pastor of Dimchurch, it was clearly incumbent on me to\ncomfort a brother in affliction. I really felt, so to speak, a longing to\nhold out the right hand of friendship to this sorely-tried man. I\nborrowed my friend's carriage, and drove straight to Browndown. We have\nhad a long and cordial talk. I have brought Mr. Dubourg home with me. He\nmust be one of us. My dear child, Mr. Dubourg must be one of us. Let me\nintroduce you. My eldest daughter--Mr. Dubourg.\"\n\nHe performed the ceremony of presentation, with the most impenetrable\ngravity, as if he really believed that Oscar and his daughter now met\neach other for the first time!\n\nNever had I set my eyes on a meaner-looking man than this rector. In\nheight he barely reached up to my shoulder. In substance, he was so\nmiserably lean that he looked the living picture of starvation. He would\nhave made his fortune in the streets of London, if he had only gone out\nand shown himself to the public in ragged clothes. His face was deeply\npitted with the small-pox. His short grisly hair stood up stiff and\nstraight on his head like hair fixed in a broom. His small whitish-grey\neyes had a restless, inquisitive, hungry look in them, indescribably\nirritating and uncomfortable to see. The one personal distinction he\npossessed consisted in his magnificent bass voice--a voice which had no\nsort of right to exist in the person who used it. Until one became\naccustomed to the contrast, there was something perfectly unbearable in\nhearing those superb big tones come out of that contemptible little body.\nThe famous Latin phrase conveys, after all, the best description I can\ngive of Reverend Finch. He was in very truth--Voice, and nothing else.\n\n\"Madame Pratolungo, no doubt?\" he went on, turning to me. \"Delighted to\nmake the acquaintance of my daughter's judicious companion and friend.\nYou must be one of us--like Mr. Dubourg. Let me introduce you. Madame\nPratolungo--Mr. Dubourg. This is the old side of the rectory, my dear\nsir. We had it put in repair--let me see: how long since?--we had it put\nin repair just after Mrs. Finch's last confinement but one.\" (I soon\ndiscovered that Mr. Finch reckoned time by his wife's confinements.) \"You\nwill find it very curious and interesting inside. Lucilla, my child! (It\nhas pleased Providence, Mr. Dubourg, to afflict my daughter with\nblindness. Inscrutable Providence!) Lucilla, this is your side of the\nhouse. Take Mr. Dubourg's arm, and lead the way. Do the honors, my child.\nMadame Pratolungo, let me offer you my arm. I regret that I was not\npresent, when you arrived, to welcome you at the rectory. Consider\nyourself--do pray consider yourself--one of us.\" He stopped, and lowered\nhis prodigious voice to a confidential growl. \"Delightful person, Mr.\nDubourg. I can't tell you how pleased I am with him. And what a sad\nstory! Cultivate Mr. Dubourg, my dear madam. As a favor to Me--cultivate\nMr. Dubourg!\"\n\nHe said this with an appearance of the deepest anxiety--and more, he\nemphasized it by affectionately squeezing my hand.\n\nI have met with a great many audacious people in my time. But the\naudacity of Reverend Finch--persisting to our faces in the assumption\nthat he had been the first to discover our neighbor, and that Lucilla and\nI were perfectly incapable of understanding and appreciating Oscar,\nunassisted by him--was entirely without a parallel in my experience. I\nasked myself what his conduct in this matter--so entirely unexpected by\nLucilla, as well as by me--could possibly mean. My knowledge of his\ncharacter, obtained through his daughter, and my memory of what we heard\nhim say on the other side of the wall, suggested that his conduct might\nmean--Money.\n\nWe assembled in the sitting-room.\n\nThe only person among us who was quite at his ease was Mr. Finch. He\nnever let his daughter and his guest alone for a single moment. \"My\nchild, show Mr. Dubourg this; show Mr. Dubourg that. Mr. Dubourg, my\ndaughter possesses this; my daughter possesses that.\" So he went on, all\nround the room. Oscar appeared to feel a little daunted by the\noverwhelming attentions of his new friend. Lucilla was, as I could see,\nsecretly irritated at finding herself authorized by her father to pay\nthose attentions to Oscar which she would have preferred offering to him\nof her own accord. As for me, I was already beginning to weary of the\npatronizing politeness of the little priest with the big voice. It was a\nrelief to us all, when a message on domestic affairs arrived in the midst\nof the proceedings from Mrs. Finch, requesting to see her husband\nimmediately on the rectory side of the house.\n\nForced to leave us, Reverend Finch made his farewell speech; taking\nOscar's hand into a kind of paternal custody in both his own hands. He\nspoke with such sonorous cordiality, that the china and glass ornaments\non Lucilla's chiffonier actually jingled an accompaniment to his booming\nbass notes.\n\n\"Come to tea, my dear sir. Without ceremony. To-night at six. We must\nkeep up your spirits, Mr. Dubourg. Cheerful society, and a little music.\nLucilla, my dear child, you will play for Mr. Dubourg, won't you? Madame\nPratolungo will do the same--at My request--I am sure. We shall make even\ndull Dimchurch agreeable to our new neighbor before we have done. What\ndoes the poet say? 'Fixed to no spot is happiness sincere; 'tis nowhere\nto be found, or everywhere.' How cheering! how true! Good day; good day.\"\n\nThe glasses left off jingling. Mr. Finch's wizen little legs took him out\nof the room.\n\nThe moment his back was turned, we both assailed Oscar with the same\nquestion. What had passed at the interview between the rector and\nhimself? Men are all alike incompetent to satisfy women, when the\nquestion between the sexes is a question of small details. A woman, in\nOscar's position, would have been able to relate to us, not only the\nwhole conversation with the rector, but every little trifling incident\nwhich had noticeably illustrated it. As things were, we could only\nextract from our unsatisfactory man the barest outline of the interview.\nThe coloring and the filling-in we were left to do for ourselves.\n\nOscar had, on his own confession, acknowledged his visitor's kindness, by\nopening his whole heart to the sympathizing rector, and placing that wary\npriest and excellent man of business in possession of the completest\nknowledge of all his affairs. In return, Reverend Finch had spoken in the\nfrankest manner, on his side. He had drawn a sad picture of the\npoverty-stricken condition of Dimchurch, viewed as an ecclesiastical\nendowment; and he had spoken in such feeling terms of the neglected\ncondition of the ancient and interesting church, that poor simple Oscar,\nsmitten with pity, had produced his cheque-book, and had subscribed on\nthe spot towards the Fund for repairing the ancient round tower. They had\nbeen still occupied with the subject of the tower and the subscription,\nwhen we had opened the garden gate and had let them in. Hearing this, I\nnow understood the motives under which our reverend friend was acting as\nwell as if they had been my own. It was plain to my mind that the rector\nhad taken his financial measure of Oscar, and had privately satisfied\nhimself, that if he encouraged the two young people in cultivating each\nother's society, money (to use his own phrase) might come of it. He had,\nas I believed, put forward \"the round tower,\" in the first instance, as a\nfeeler; and he would follow it up, in due time, by an appeal of a more\npersonal nature to Oscar's well-filled purse. Brief, he was, in my\nopinion, quite sharp enough (after having studied his young friend's\ncharacter) to foresee an addition to his income, rather than a\nsubtraction from it, if the relations between Oscar and his daughter\nended in a marriage.\n\nWhether Lucilla arrived, on her side, at the same conclusion as mine, is\nwhat I cannot venture positively to declare. I can only relate that she\nlooked ill at ease as the facts came out; and that she took the first\nopportunity of extinguishing her father, viewed as a topic of\nconversation.\n\nAs for Oscar, it was enough for him that he had already secured his place\nas friend of the house. He took leave of us in the highest spirits. I had\nmy eye on them when he and Lucilla said good-bye. She squeezed his hand.\nI saw her do it. At the rate at which things were now going on, I began\nto ask myself whether Reverend Finch would not appear at tea-time in his\nrobes of office, and celebrate the marriage of his \"sorely-tried\" young\nfriend between the first cup and the second.\n\nAt our little social assembly in the evening, nothing passed worthy of\nmuch remark.\n\nLucilla and I (I cannot resist recording this) were both beautifully\ndressed, in honor of the occasion; Mrs. Finch serving us to perfection,\nby way of contrast. She had made an immense effort--she was half dressed.\nHer evening costume was an ancient green silk skirt (with traces of past\nbabies visible on it to an experienced eye), topped by the everlasting\nblue merino jacket. \"I lose everything belonging to me,\" Mrs. Finch\nwhispered in my ear. \"I have got a body to this dress, and it can't be\nfound anywhere.\" The rector's prodigious voice was never silent: the\npompous and plausible little man talked, talked, talked, in deeper and\ndeeper bass, until the very teacups on the table shuddered under the\ninfluence of him. The elder children, admitted to the family festival,\nate till they could eat no more; stared till they could stare no more;\nyawned till they could yawn no more--and then went to bed. Oscar got on\nwell with everybody. Mrs. Finch was naturally interested in him as one of\ntwins--though she was also surprised and disappointed at hearing that his\nmother had begun and ended with his brother and himself. As for Lucilla,\nshe sat in silent happiness, absorbed in the inexhaustible delight of\nhearing Oscar's voice. She found as many varieties of expression in\nlistening to her beloved tones, as the rest of us find in looking at our\nbeloved face. We had music later in the evening--and I then heard, for\nthe first time, how charmingly Lucilla played. She was a born musician,\nwith a delicacy and subtlety of touch such as few even of the greatest\n_virtuosi_ possess. Oscar was enchanted. In a word, the evening was a\nsuccess.\n\nI contrived, when our guest took his departure, to say my contemplated\nword to him in private, on the subject of his solitary position at\nBrowndown.\n\nThose doubts of Oscar's security in his lonely house, which I have\ndescribed as having been suggested to me by the discovery of the two\nruffians lurking under the wall, still maintained their place in my mind;\nand still urged me to warn him to take precautions of some sort, before\nthe precious metals which he had sent to London to be melted, came back\nto him again. He gave me the opportunity I wanted, by looking at his\nwatch, and apologizing for protracting his visit to a terribly late hour,\nfor the country--the hour of midnight.\n\n\"Is your servant sitting up for you?\" I asked, assuming to be ignorant of\nhis domestic arrangements.\n\nHe pulled out of his pocket a great clumsy key.\n\n\"This is my only servant at Browndown,\" he said. \"By four or five in the\nafternoon, the people at the inn have done all for me that I want. After\nthat time, there is nobody in the house but myself.\"\n\nHe shook hands with us. The rector escorted him as far as the front door.\nI slipped out while they were saying their last words, and joined Oscar,\nwhen he advanced alone into the garden.\n\n\"I want a breath of fresh air,\" I said. \"I'll go with you as far as the\ngate.\"\n\nHe began to talk of Lucilla directly. I surprised him by returning\nabruptly to the subject of his position at Browndown.\n\n\"Do you think it's wise,\" I asked, \"to be all by yourself at night in\nsuch a lonely house as yours? Why don't you have a manservant?\"\n\n\"I detest strange servants,\" he answered. \"I infinitely prefer being by\nmyself.\"\n\n\"When do you expect your gold and silver plates to be returned to you?\"\n\n\"In about a week.\"\n\n\"What would be the value of them, in money--at a rough guess?\"\n\n\"At a rough guess--about seventy or eighty pounds.\"\n\n\"In a week's time then,\" I said, \"you will have seventy or eighty pounds'\nworth of property at Browndown. Property which a thief need only put into\nthe melting-pot, to have no fear of its being traced into his hands.\"\n\nOscar stopped, and looked at me.\n\n\"What _can_ you be thinking of!\" he asked. \"There are no thieves in this\nprimitive place.\"\n\n\"There are thieves in other places,\" I answered. \"And they may come here.\nHave you forgotten those two men whom we caught hanging about Browndown\nyesterday?\"\n\nHe smiled. I had recalled to him a humourous association--nothing more.\n\n\"It was not we who caught them,\" he said. \"It was that strange child.\nWhat do you say to my having Jicks to sleep in the house and take care of\nme?\"\n\n\"I am not joking,\" I rejoined. \"I never met with two more ill-looking\nvillains in my life. The window was open when you were telling me about\nthe necessity for melting the plates again. They may know as well as we\ndo, that your gold and silver will be returned to you after a time.\"\n\n\"What an imagination you have got!\" he exclaimed. \"You see a couple of\nshabby excursionists from Brighton, who have wandered to Dimchurch--and\nyou instantly transform them into a pair of housebreakers in a conspiracy\nto rob and murder me! You and my brother Nugent would just suit each\nother. His imagination runs away with him, exactly like yours.\"\n\n\"Take my advice,\" I answered gravely. \"Don't persist in sleeping at\nBrowndown without a living creature in the house with you.\"\n\nHe was in wild good spirits. He kissed my hand, and thanked me in his\nvoluble exaggerated way for the interest that I took in him. \"All right!\"\nhe said, as he opened the gate. \"I'll have a living creature in the house\nwith me. I'll get a dog.\"\n\nWe parted. I had told him what was on my mind. I could do no more. After\nall, it might be quite possible that his view was the right one, and mine\nthe wrong.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRTEENTH\n\nSecond Appearance of Jicks\n\nFIVE more days passed.\n\nDuring that interval, we saw our new neighbor constantly. Either Oscar\ncame to the rectory, or we went to Browndown. Reverend Finch waited, with\na masterly assumption of suspecting nothing, until the relations between\nthe two young people were ripe enough to develop into relations of\nacknowledged love. They were already (under Lucilla's influence)\nadvancing rapidly to that point. You are not to blame my poor blind girl,\nif you please, for frankly encouraging the man she loved. He was the most\nbackward man--viewed as a suitor--whom I ever met with. The fonder he\ngrew of her, the more timid and self-distrustful he became. I own I don't\nlike a modest man; and I cannot honestly say that Mr. Oscar Dubourg, on\ncloser acquaintance, advanced himself much in my estimation. However,\nLucilla understood him, and that was enough. She was determined to have\nthe completest possible image of him in her mind. Everybody in the house\nwho had seen him (the children included) she examined and cross-examined\non the subject of his personal appearance, as she had already examined\nand cross-examined me. His features and his color, his height and his\nbreadth; his ornaments and his clothes--on all these points she collected\nevidence, in every direction and in the smallest detail. It was an\nespecial relief and delight to her to hear, on all sides, that his\ncomplexion was fair. There was no reasoning with her against her blind\nhorror of dark shades of color, whether seen in men, women, or things.\nShe was quite unable to account for it; she could only declare it.\n\n\"I have the strangest instincts of my own about some things,\" she said to\nme one day. \"For instance, I knew that Oscar was bright and fair--I mean\nI felt it in myself--on that delightful evening when I first heard the\nsound of his voice. It went straight from my ear to my heart; and it\ndescribed him, just as the rest of you have described him to me since.\nMrs. Finch tells me his complexion is lighter than mine. Do you think so\ntoo? I am so glad to hear that he is fairer than I am! Did you ever meet\nbefore with a person like me? I have the oddest ideas in this blind head\nof mine. I associate life and beauty with light colors, and death and\ncrime with dark colors. If I married a man with a dark complexion, and if\nI recovered my sight afterwards, I should run away from him.\"\n\nThis singular prejudice of hers against dark people was a little annoying\nto me on personal grounds. It was a sort of reflection on my own taste.\nBetween ourselves, the late Doctor Pratolungo was of a fine mahogany\nbrown all over.\n\nAs for affairs in general at Dimchurch, my chronicle of the five days\nfinds little to dwell on that is worth recording.\n\nWe were not startled by any second appearance of the two ruffians at\nBrowndown--neither was any change made by Oscar in his domestic\nestablishment. He was favored with more than one visit from our little\nwandering Jicks. On each occasion, the child gravely reminded him of his\nrash promise to appeal to the police, and visit with corporal punishment\nthe two ugly strangers who had laughed at her. When were the men to be\nbeaten? and when was Jicks to see it? Such were the serious questions\nwith which this young lady regularly opened the proceedings, on each\noccasion when she favored Oscar with a morning call.\n\nOn the sixth day, the gold and silver plates were returned to Browndown\nfrom the manufactory in London.\n\nThe next morning a note arrived for me from Oscar. It ran thus:--\n\n\"DEAR MADAME PRATOLUNGO,--I regret to inform you that nothing happened to\nme last night. My locks and bolts are in their usual good order; my gold\nand silver plates are safe in the workshop: and I myself am now eating my\nbreakfast with an uncut throat--Yours ever,\n\n\"OSCAR.\"\n\nAfter this, there was no more to be said. Jicks might persist in\nremembering the two ill-looking strangers. Older and wiser people\ndismissed them from all further consideration.\n\nSaturday came--making the tenth day since the memorable morning when I\nhad forced Oscar to disclose himself to me in the little side-room at\nBrowndown.\n\nIn the forenoon we had a visit from him at the rectory. In the afternoon\nwe went to Browndown, to see him begin a new piece of chasing in gold--a\ncasket for holding gloves--destined to take its place on Lucilla's\ntoilet-table when it was done. We left him industriously at work;\ndetermined to go on as long as the daylight lasted.\n\nEarly in the evening, Lucilla sat down at her pianoforte; and I paid a\nvisit by appointment to the rectory side of the house.\n\nUnhappy Mrs. Finch had determined to institute a complete reform of her\nwardrobe. She had entreated me to give her the benefit of \"my French\ntaste,\" in the capacity of confidential critic and adviser. \"I can't\nafford to buy any new things,\" said the poor lady. \"But a deal might be\ndone in altering what I have got by me, if a clever person took the\nmatter up.\" Who could resist that piteous appeal? I resigned myself to\nthe baby, the novel, and the children in general; and (Reverend Finch\nbeing out of the way, writing his sermon) I presented myself in Mrs.\nFinch's parlor, full of ideas, with my scissors and my pattern-paper\nready in my hand.\n\nWe had only begun our operations, when one of the elder children arrived\nwith a message from the nursery.\n\nIt was tea-time; and, as usual, Jicks was missing. She was searched for,\nfirst in the lower regions of the house; secondly in the garden. Not a\ntrace of her was to be discovered in either quarter. Nobody was surprised\nor alarmed. We said, \"Oh, dear, she has gone to Browndown again!\"--and\nimmersed ourselves once more in the shabby recesses of Mrs. Finch's\nwardrobe.\n\nI had just decided that the blue merino jacket was an article of wearing\napparel which had done its duty, and earned its right to final retirement\nfrom the scene--when a plaintive cry reached my ear, through the open\ndoor which led into the back garden.\n\nI stopped, and looked at Mrs. Finch.\n\nThe cry was repeated, louder and nearer: recognizable this time as a cry\nin a child's voice. The door of the room had been left ajar, when we sent\nthe messenger back to the nursery. I threw it open, and found myself face\nto face with Jicks in the passage.\n\nI felt every nerve in my body shudder at the sight of the child.\n\nThe poor little thing was white and wild with terror. She was incapable\nof uttering a word. When I knelt down to fondle and soothe her, she\ncaught convulsively at my hand, and attempted to raise me. I got on my\nfeet again. She repeated her dumb cry more loudly--and tried to drag me\nout of the house. She was so weak that she staggered under the effort. I\ntook her up in my arms. One of my hands, as I embraced her, touched the\ntop of her frock, just below the back of her neck. I felt something on my\nfingers. I looked at them. Gracious God! I was stained with blood!\n\nI turned the child round. My own blood froze. Her mother, standing behind\nme, screamed with horror.\n\nThe dear little thing's white frock was spotted and splashed with wet\nblood. Not her own blood. There was not a scratch on her. I looked closer\nat the horrid marks. They had been drawn purposely on her--drawn, as it\nseemed, with a finger. I took her out into the light. It was writing! A\nword had been feebly traced on the back of her frock. I made out\nsomething like the letter \"H.\" Then a letter which it was impossible to\nread.\n\nThen another next to it, which might have been \"L,\" or might have been\n\"J.\" Then a last letter, which I guessed to be \"P.\"\n\nWas the word--\"Help\"?\n\nYes!--traced on the back of the child's frock, with a finger dipped in\nblood--\"HELP.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FOURTEENTH\n\nDiscoveries at Browndown\n\nIT is needless to tell you at what conclusion I arrived, as soon as I was\nsufficiently myself to think at all.\n\nThanks to my adventurous past life, I have got the habit of deciding\nquickly in serious emergencies of all sorts. In the present emergency--as\nI saw it--there were two things to be done. One, to go instantly with\nhelp to Browndown: the other, to keep the knowledge of what had happened\nfrom Lucilla until I could get back again, and prepare her for the\ndiscovery.\n\nI looked at Mrs. Finch. She had dropped helplessly into a chair. \"Rouse\nyourself!\" I said--and shook her. It was no time for sympathizing with\nswoons and hysterics. The child was still in my arms; fast yielding, poor\nlittle thing, to the exhaustion of fatigue and terror. I could do nothing\nuntil I had relieved myself of the charge of her. Mrs. Finch looked up at\nme, trembling and sobbing. I put the child in her lap. Jicks feebly\nresisted being parted from me; but soon gave up, and dropped her weary\nlittle head on her mother's bosom. \"Can you take off her frock?\" I asked,\nwith another shake--a good one, this time. The prospect of a domestic\noccupation (of any sort) appeared to rouse Mrs. Finch. She looked at the\nbaby, in its cradle in one corner of the room, and at the novel, reposing\non a chair in another corner of the room. The presence of these two\nfamiliar objects appeared to encourage her. She shivered, she swallowed a\nsob, she recovered her breath, she began to undo the frock.\n\n\"Put it away carefully,\" I said; \"and say nothing to anybody of what has\nhappened, until I come back. You can see for yourself that the child is\nnot hurt. Soothe her, and wait here. Is Mr. Finch in the study?\"\n\nMrs. Finch swallowed another sob, and said, \"Yes.\" The child made a last\neffort. \"Jicks will go with you,\" said the indomitable little Arab\nfaintly. I ran out of the room, and left the three babies--big, little,\nand least--together.\n\nAfter knocking at the study door without getting any reply, I opened it\nand went in. Reverend Finch, comfortably prostrate in a large arm-chair\n(with his sermon-paper spread out in fair white sheets by his side),\nstarted up, and confronted me in the character of a clergyman that moment\nawakened from a sound sleep.\n\nThe rector of Dimchurch instantly recovered his dignity.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, Madame Pratolungo, I was deep in thought. Please\nstate your business briefly.\" Saying those words, he waved his hand\nmagnificently over his empty sheets of paper, and added in his deepest\nbass: \"Sermon-day.\"\n\nI told him in the plainest words what I had seen on his child's frock,\nand what I feared had happened at Browndown. He turned deadly pale. If I\never yet set my two eyes on a man thoroughly frightened, Reverend Finch\nwas that man.\n\n\"Do you anticipate danger?\" he inquired. \"Is it your opinion that\ncriminal persons are in, or near, the house?\"\n\n\"It is my opinion that there is not a moment to be lost,\" I answered. \"We\nmust go to Browndown; and we must get what help we can on the way.\"\n\nI opened the door, and waited for him to come out with me. Mr. Finch\n(still apparently pre-occupied with the question of the criminal persons)\nlooked as if he wished himself a hundred miles from his own rectory at\nthat particular moment. But he was the master of the house; he was the\nprincipal man in the place--he had no other alternative, as matters now\nstood, than to take his hat and go.\n\nWe went out together into the village. My reverend companion was silent\nfor the first time in my limited experience of him. We inquired for the\none policeman who patrolled the district. He was away on his rounds. We\nasked if anybody had seen the doctor. No: it was not the doctor's day for\nvisiting Dimchurch. I had heard the landlord of the Gross Hands described\nas a capable and respectable man; and I suggested stopping at the inn,\nand taking him with us. Mr. Finch instantly brightened at that proposal.\nHis sense of his own importance rose again, like the mercury in a\nthermometer when you put it into a warm bath.\n\n\"Exactly what I was about to suggest,\" he said. \"Gootheridge of the Gross\nHands is a very worthy person--for his station in life. Let us have\nGootheridge, by all means. Don't be alarmed, Madame Pratolungo. We are\nall in the hands of Providence. It is most fortunate for you that I was\nat home. What would you have done without me? Now don't, pray don't, be\nalarmed. In case of criminal persons--I have my stick, as you see. I am\nnot tall; but I possess immense physical strength. I am, so to speak, all\nmuscle. Feel!\"\n\nHe held out one of his wizen little arms. It was about half the size of\nmy arm. If I had not been far too anxious to think of playing tricks, I\nshould certainly have declared that it was needless, with such a tower of\nstrength by my side, to disturb the landlord. I dare not assert that Mr.\nFinch actually detected the turn my thoughts were taking--I can only\ndeclare that he did certainly shout for Gootheridge in a violent hurry,\nthe moment we were in sight of the inn.\n\nThe landlord came out; and, hearing what our errand was, instantly\nconsented to join us.\n\n\"Take your gun,\" said Mr. Finch.\n\nGootheridge took his gun. We hastened on to the house.\n\n\"Were Mrs. Gootheridge or your daughter at Browndown today?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am--they were both at Browndown. They finished up their work as\nusual--and left the house more than an hour since.\"\n\n\"Did anything out of the common happen while they were there?\"\n\n\"Nothing that I heard of, ma'am.\"\n\nI considered with myself for a minute, and ventured on putting a few more\nquestions to Mr. Gootheridge.\n\n\"Have any strangers been seen here this evening?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am. Nearly an hour ago two strangers drove by my house in a\nchaise.\"\n\n\"In what direction?\"\n\n\"Coming from Brighton way, and going towards Browndown.\"\n\n\"Did you notice the men?\"\n\n\"Not particularly, ma'am. I was busy at the time.\"\n\nA sickening suspicion that the two strangers in the chaise might be the\ntwo men whom I had seen lurking under the wall, forced its way into my\nmind. I said no more until we reached the house.\n\nAll was quiet. The one sign of anything unusual was in the plain traces\nof the passage of wheels over the turf in front of Browndown. The\nlandlord was the first to see them. \"The chaise must have stopped at the\nhouse, sir,\" he said, addressing himself to the rector.\n\nReverend Finch was suffering under a second suspension of speech. All he\ncould say as we approached the door of the silent and solitary\nbuilding--and he said that with extreme difficulty--was, \"Pray let us be\ncareful!\"\n\nThe landlord was the first to reach the door. I was behind him. The\nrector--at some little distance--acted as rear-guard, with the South\nDowns behind him to retreat upon. Gootheridge rapped smartly on the door,\nand called out, \"Mr. Dubourg!\" There was no answer. There was only a\ndreadful silence. The suspense was more than I could endure. I pushed by\nthe landlord, and turned the handle of the unlocked door.\n\n\"Let me go first, ma'am,\" said Gootheridge.\n\nHe pushed by me, in his turn. I followed him close. We entered the house,\nand called again. Again there was no answer. We looked into the little\nsitting-room on one side of the passage, and into the dining-room on the\nother. Both were empty. We went on to the back of the house, where the\nroom was situated which Oscar called his workshop. When we tried the door\nof the workshop it was locked.\n\nWe knocked, and called again. The horrid silence was all that\nfollowed--as before.\n\nI tried the keyhole with my finger. The key was not in the lock. I knelt\ndown, and looked through the keyhole. The next instant, I was up again on\nmy feet, wild and giddy with horror.\n\n\"Burst open the door!\" I screamed. \"I can just see his hand lying on the\nfloor!\"\n\nThe landlord, like the rector, was a little man; and the door, like\neverything else at Browndown, was of the clumsiest and heaviest\nconstruction. Unaided by instruments, we should all three together have\nbeen too weak to burst it open. In this difficulty, Reverend Finch proved\nto be--for the first time, and also for the last--of some use.\n\n\"Stay!\" he said. \"My friends, if the back garden gate is open, we can get\nin by the window.\"\n\nNeither the landlord nor I had thought of the window. We ran round to the\nback of the house; seeing the marks of the chaise-wheels leading in the\nsame direction. The gate in the wall was wide open. We crossed the little\ngarden. The window of the workshop--opening to the ground--gave us\nadmission as the rector had foretold. We entered the room.\n\nThere he lay--poor harmless, unlucky Oscar--senseless, in a pool of his\nown blood. A blow on the left side of his head had, to all appearance,\nfelled him on the spot. The wound had split the scalp. Whether it had\nalso split the skull was more than I was surgeon enough to be able to\nsay. I had gathered some experience of how to deal with wounded men, when\nI served the sacred cause of Freedom with my glorious Pratolungo. Cold\nwater, vinegar, and linen for bandages--these were all in the house; and\nthese I called for. Gootheridge found the key of the door flung aside in\na corner of the room. He got the water and the vinegar, while I ran\nup-stairs to Oscar's bedroom, and provided myself with some of his\nhandkerchiefs. In a few minutes, I had a cold water bandage over the\nwound, and was bathing his face in vinegar and water. He was still\ninsensible; but he lived. Reverend Finch--not of the slightest help to\nanybody--assumed the duty of feeling Oscar's pulse. He did it as if,\nunder the circumstances, this was the one meritorious action that could\nbe performed. He looked as if nobody could feel a pulse but himself.\n\"Most fortunate,\" he said, counting the slow, faint throbbing at the poor\nfellow's wrist--\"most fortunate that I was at home. What would you have\ndone without me?\"\n\nThe next necessity was, of course, to send for the doctor, and to get\nhelp, in the meantime, to carry Oscar up-stairs to his bed.\n\nGootheridge volunteered to borrow a horse, and to ride off for the\ndoctor. We arranged that he was to send his wife and his wife's brother\nto help me. This settled, the one last embarrassment left to deal with,\nwas the embarrassment of Mr. Finch. Now that we were free from all fear\nof encountering bad characters in the house, the _boom-boom_ of the\nlittle man's big voice went on unintermittingly, like a machine at work\nin the neighborhood. I had another of my inspirations--sitting on the\nfloor with Oscar's head on my lap. I gave my reverend companion something\nto do. \"Look about the room!\" I said. \"See if the packing-case with the\ngold and silver plates is here or not.\"\n\nMr. Finch did not quite relish being treated like an ordinary mortal, and\nbeing told what he was to do.\n\n\"Compose yourself, Madame Pratolungo,\" he said. \"No hysterical activity,\nif you please. This business is in My hands. Quite needless, ma'am, to\ntell Me to look for the packing-case.\"\n\n\"Quite needless,\" I agreed. \"I know beforehand the packing-case is gone.\"\n\nThat answer instantly set him fussing about the room. Not a sign of the\ncase was to be seen.\n\nAll doubt in my mind was at an end now. The two ruffians lounging against\nthe wall had justified, horribly justified, my worst suspicions of them.\n\nOn the arrival of Mrs. Gootheridge and her brother, we carried him up to\nhis room. We laid him on the bed, with his neck-tie off, and his throat\nfree, and the air blowing over him from the open window. He showed no\nsign yet of coming to his senses. But still the pulse went faintly on. No\nchange was discernible for the worse.\n\nIt was useless to hope for the doctor's arrival, before another hour at\nleast. I felt the necessity of getting back at once to the rectory, so as\nto be able to tell Lucilla (with all needful preparation) the melancholy\ntruth. Otherwise, the news of what had happened would get abroad in the\nvillage, and might come to her ears, in the worst possible way, through\none of the servants. To my infinite relief, Mr. Finch, when I rose to go,\nexcused himself from accompanying me. He had discovered that it was his\nduty, as rector, to give the earliest information of the outrage at\nBrowndown to the legal authorities. He went his way to the nearest\nmagistrate. And I went mine--leaving Oscar under the care of Mrs.\nGootheridge and her brother--back to the house. Mr. Finch's last words at\nparting reminded me, once more, that we had one thing at least to be\nthankful for under the circumstances--sad as they otherwise were.\n\n\"Most fortunate, Madame Pratolungo, that I was at home. What would you\nhave done without me?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FIFTEENTH\n\nEvents at the Bedside\n\nI AM, if you will be so good as to remember, constitutionally\nFrench--and, therefore, constitutionally averse to distressing myself, if\nI can possibly help it. For this reason, I really cannot summon courage\nto describe what passed between my blind Lucilla and me when I returned\nto our pretty sitting-room. She made me cry at the time; and she would\nmake me (and perhaps you) cry again now, if I wrote the little melancholy\nstory of what this tender young creature suffered when I told her my\nmiserable news. I won't write it; I am dead against tears. They affect\nthe nose; and my nose is my best feature. Let us use our eyes, my fair\nfriends, to conquer, not to cry.\n\nBe it enough to say, that when I went back to Browndown, Lucilla went\nwith me.\n\nI now observed her, for the first time, to be jealous of the eyes of us\nhappy people who could see. The instant she entered, she insisted on\nbeing near enough to the bed, to hear us, or to touch us, as we waited on\nthe injured man. This was at once followed by her taking the place\noccupied by Mrs. Gootheridge at the bed-head, and herself bathing Oscar's\nface and forehead. She was even jealous of _me,_ when she discovered that\nI was moistening the bandages on the wound. I irritated her into boldly\nkissing the poor insensible face in our presence! The landlady of the\nCross Hands was one of my sort: she took cheerful views of things. \"Sweet\non him--eh, ma'am?\" she whispered in my ear; \"we shall have a wedding in\nDimchurch.\" In presence of these kissings and whisperings, Mrs.\nGootheridge's brother, as the only man present, began to look very\nuncomfortable. This worthy creature belonged to that large and\nrespectable order of Englishmen, who don't know what to do with their\nhands, or how to get out of a room. I took pity on him--he was, I assure\nyou, a fine man. \"Smoke your pipe, sir, in the garden,\" I said. \"We will\ncall to you from the window, if we want you up here.\" Mrs. Gootheridge's\nbrother cast on me one look of unutterable gratitude--and escaped, as if\nhe had been let out of a trap.\n\nAt last, the doctor came.\n\nHis first words were an indescribable relief to us. The skull of our poor\nOscar was not injured. There was concussion of the brain, and there was a\nscalp-wound--inflicted evidently with a blunt instrument. As to the\nwound, I had done all that was necessary in the doctor's absence. As to\nthe injury to the brain, time and care would put everything right again.\n\"Make your minds easy, ladies,\" said this angel of a man. \"There is no\nreason for feeling the slightest alarm about him.\"\n\nHe came to his senses--that is to say, he opened his eyes and looked\nvacantly about him--between four and five hours after the time when we\nhad found him on the floor of the workshop.\n\nHis mind, poor fellow, was still all astray. He recognized nobody. He\nimitated the action of writing with his finger; and said very earnestly,\nover and over again, \"Go home, Jicks; go home, go home!\" fancying himself\n(as I suppose), lying helpless on the floor, and sending the child back\nto us to give the alarm. Later in the night he fell asleep. All through\nthe next day, he still wandered in his mind when he spoke. It was not\ntill the day after, that he began feebly to recover his reason. The first\nperson he recognized was Lucilla. She was engaged at the moment in\nbrushing his beautiful chestnut hair. To her unutterable joy, he patted\nher hand, and murmured her name.\n\nShe bent over him; and, under cover of the hair-brush, whispered\nsomething in his ear which made the young fellow's pale face flush, and\nhis dull eyes brighten with pleasure. A day or two afterwards, she owned\nto me that she had said, \"Get well, for my sake.\" She was not in the\nleast ashamed of having spoken to that plain purpose. On the contrary,\nshe triumphed in it. \"Leave him to me,\" said Lucilla, in the most\npositive manner. \"I mean first to cure him. And then I mean to be his\nwife.\"\n\nIn a week more, he was in complete possession of his faculties--but still\nwretchedly weak, and only gaining ground very slowly after the shock that\nhe had suffered.\n\nHe was now able to tell us, by a little at a time, of what had happened\nin the workshop.\n\nAfter Mrs. Gootheridge and her daughter had quitted the house at their\nusual hour, he had gone up to his room; had remained there some little\ntime; and had then gone downstairs again. On approaching the workshop, he\nheard voices talking in whispers in the room. The idea instantly occurred\nto him that something was wrong. He softly tried the door, and found it\nlocked--the robbers having no doubt taken that precaution, to prevent\ntheir being surprised at their thieving work by any person in the house.\nThe one other way of getting into the room, was the way that we had\ntried. He went round to the back garden, and found an empty chaise drawn\nup outside the door. This circumstance thoroughly puzzled him. But for\nthe mysterious locking of the workshop door, it would have suggested to\nhim nothing more alarming than the arrival of some unexpected visitors.\nEager to solve the mystery, he crossed the garden; and, entering the\nroom, found himself face to face with the same two men whom Jicks had\ndiscovered ten days previously lounging against the wall.\n\nAs he approached the window, they were both busily engaged, with their\nbacks towards him, in cording up the packing-case which contained the\nmetal plates.\n\nThey rose and faced him as he stepped into the room. The act of robbery\nwhich he found them coolly perpetrating in broad daylight, instantly set\nhis irritable temper in a flame. He rushed at the younger of the two\nmen--being the one nearest to him. The ruffian sprang aside out of his\nreach; snatched up from the table on which it was lying ready, a short\nloaded staff of leather called \"a life-preserver;\" and struck him with it\non the head, before he had recovered himself, and could face his man once\nmore.\n\nFrom that moment, he remembered nothing, until he had regained his\nconsciousness after the first shock of the blow.\n\nHe found himself lying, giddy and bleeding, on the floor; and he saw the\nchild (who must have strayed into the room while he was senseless)\nstanding petrified with fear, looking at him. The idea of making use of\nher--as the only living being near--to give the alarm, came to him\ninstinctively the moment he recognized her. He coaxed the little creature\nto venture within reach of his hand; and, dipping his finger in the blood\nthat was flowing from him, sent us the terrible message which I had spelt\nout on the back of her frock. That done, he exerted his last remains of\nstrength to push her gently towards the open window, and direct her to go\nhome. He fainted from loss of blood, while he was still repeating the\nwords, \"Go home! go home!\"--and still seeing, or fancying that he saw,\nthe child stopping obstinately in the room, stupefied with terror. Of the\ntime at which she found the courage and the sense to run home, and of all\nthat had happened after that, he was necessarily ignorant. His next\nconscious impression was the impression, already recorded, of seeing\nLucilla sitting by his bedside.\n\nThe account of the matter thus given by Oscar, was followed by a\nsupplementary statement provided by the police.\n\nThe machinery of the law was put in action; and the village was kept in a\nfever of excitement for days together. Never was there a more complete\ninvestigation--and never was a poorer result achieved. Substantially,\nnothing was discovered beyond what I had already found out for myself.\nThe robbery was declared to have been (as I had supposed) a planned\nthing. Though we had none of us noticed them at the rectory, it was\nascertained that the thieves had been at Dimchurch on the day when the\nunlucky plates were first delivered at Browndown. Having taken their time\nto examine the house, and to make themselves acquainted with the domestic\nhabits of the persons in it, the rogues had paid their second visit to\nthe village--no doubt to commit the robbery--on the occasion when we had\ndiscovered them. Foiled by the unexpected return of the gold and silver\nto London, they had waited again, had followed the plates back to\nBrowndown, and had effected their object--thanks to the lonely situation\nof the house, and to the murderous blow which had stretched Oscar\ninsensible on the floor.\n\nMore than one witness had met them on the road back to Brighton, with the\npacking-case in the chaise. But when they returned to the livery-stables\nfrom which they had hired the vehicle, the case was not to be seen.\nAccomplices in Brighton had, in all probability, assisted them in getting\nrid of it, and in shifting the plates into ordinary articles of luggage,\nwhich would attract no special attention at the railway station. This was\nthe explanation given by the police. Right or wrong, the one fact remains\nthat the villains were not caught, and that the assault and robbery at\nOscar's house may be added to the long list of crimes cleverly enough\ncommitted to defy the vengeance of the law.\n\nFor ourselves, we all agreed--led by Lucilla--to indulge in no useless\nlamentations, and to be grateful that Oscar had escaped without serious\ninjury. The mischief was done; and there was an end of it.\n\nIn this philosophical spirit, we looked at the affair while our invalid\nwas recovering. We all plumed ourselves on our excellent good sense--and\n(ah, poor stupid human wretches!) we were all fatally wrong. So far from\nthe mischief being at an end, the mischief had only begun. The true\nresults of the robbery at Browndown were yet to show themselves, and were\nyet to be felt in the strangest and the saddest way by every member of\nthe little circle assembled at Dimchurch.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SIXTEENTH\n\nFirst Result of the Robbery\n\nBETWEEN five and six weeks passed. Oscar was out of his bed-room, and was\nwell of his wound.\n\nDuring this lapse of time, Lucilla steadily pursued that process of her\nown of curing him, which was to end in marrying him. Never had I seen\nsuch nursing before--never do I expect to see such nursing again. From\nmorning to night, she interested him, and kept him in good spirits. The\ncharming creature actually made her blindness a means of lightening the\nweary hours of the man she loved.\n\nSometimes, she would sit before Oscar's looking-glass, and imitate all\nthe innumerable tricks, artifices, and vanities of a coquette arraying\nherself for conquest--with such wonderful truth and humour of mimicry,\nthat you would have sworn she possessed the use of her eyes. Sometimes,\nshe would show him her extraordinary power of calculating by the sound of\na person's voice, the exact position which that person occupied towards\nher in a room. Selecting me as the victim, she would first provide\nherself with one of the nosegays always placed by her own hands at\nOscar's bedside; and would then tell me to take up my position\nnoiselessly in any part of the room that I pleased, and to say \"Lucilla.\"\nThe instant the words were out of my mouth, the nosegay flew from her\nhand, and hit me on the face. She never once missed her aim, on any one\nof the occasions when this experiment was tried--and she never once\nflagged in her childish enjoyment of the exhibition of her own skill.\n\nNobody was allowed to pour out Oscar's medicine but herself. She knew\nwhen the spoon into which it was to be measured was full, by the sound\nwhich the liquid made in falling into it. When he was able to sit up in\nhis bed, and when she was standing at the pillow-side, she could tell him\nhow near his head was to hers, by the change which he produced, when he\nbent forward or when he drew back, in the action of the air on her face.\nIn the same way, she knew as well as he knew, when the sun was out and\nwhen it was behind a cloud--judging by the differing effect of the air,\nat such times, on her forehead and on her cheeks.\n\nAll the litter of little objects accumulating in a sick-room, she kept in\nperfect order on a system of her own. She delighted in putting the room\ntidy late in the evening, when we helpless people who could see were\nbeginning to think of lighting the candles. The time when we could just\ndiscern her, flitting to and fro in the dusk, in her bright summer\ndress--now visible as she passed the window, now lost in the shadows at\nthe end of the room--was the time when she began to clear the tables of\nthe things that had been wanted in the day, and to replace them by the\nthings which would be wanted at night. We were only allowed to light the\ncandles when they showed us the room magically put in order during the\ndarkness as if the fairies had done it. She laughed scornfully at our\nsurprise, and said she sincerely pitied the poor useless people who could\nonly see!\n\nThe same pleasure which she had in arranging the room in the dark she\nalso felt in wandering all over the house in the dark, and in making\nherself thoroughly acquainted with every inch of it from top to bottom.\nAs soon as Oscar was well enough to go down-stairs, she insisted on\nleading him.\n\n\"You have been so long up in your bedroom,\" she said, \"that you must have\nforgotten the rest of the house. Take my arm--and come along. Now we are\nout in the passage. Mind! there is a step down, just at this place. And\nnow a step up again. Here is a sharp corner to turn at the top of the\nstaircase. And there is a rod out of the stair-carpet, and an awkward\nfold in it that might throw you down.\" So she took him into his own\ndrawing-room, as if it was he that was blind, and she who had the use of\nher eyes. Who could resist such a nurse as this? Is it wonderful that I\nheard a sound suspiciously like the sound of a kiss, on that first day of\nconvalescence, when I happened for a moment to be out of the room? I\nstrongly suspected her of leading the way in that also. She was so\nwonderfully composed when I came back--and he was so wonderfully\nflurried.\n\nIn a week from his convalescence, Lucilla completed the cure of the\npatient. In other words, she received from Oscar an offer of marriage. I\nhave not the slightest doubt, in my own mind, that he required assistance\nin bringing this delicate matter to a climax--and that Lucilla helped\nhim.\n\nI may be right or I may be wrong about this. But I can at least certify\nthat Lucilla was in such mad high spirits when she told me the news out\nin the garden, on a lovely autumn morning, that she actually danced for\njoy--and, more improper still, she made me, at my discreet time of life,\ndance too. She took me round the waist, and we waltzed on the grass--Mrs.\nFinch standing by in the condemned blue merino jacket (with the baby in\none hand and the novel in the other), and warning us both that if we lost\nhalf an hour out of our day, in whirling each other round the lawn, we\nshould never succeed in picking it up again in that house. We went on\nwhirling, for all that, until we were both out of breath. Nothing short\nof downright exhaustion could tame Lucilla. As for me, I am, I sincerely\nbelieve, the rashest person of my age now in existence. (What is my age?\nAh, I am always discreet about that; it is the one exception.) Set down\nmy rashness to my French nationality, my easy conscience, and my\nexcellent stomach--and let us go on with our story.\n\nThere was a private interview at Browndown, later on that day, between\nOscar and Reverend Finch.\n\nOf what passed on that occasion, I was not informed. The rector came back\namong us with his head high in the air, strutting magnificently on his\nwizen little legs. He embraced his daughter in pathetic silence, and gave\nme his hand with a serene smile of condescension worthy of the greatest\nhumbug (say Louis the Fourteenth) that ever sat on a throne. When he got\nthe better of his paternal emotion, and began to speak, his voice was so\nbig that I really thought it must have burst him. The vapor of words in\nwhich he enveloped himself (condensed on paper) amounted to these two\nstatements. First, that he hailed in Oscar (not having, I suppose,\nchildren enough already of his own) the advent of another son. Secondly,\nthat he saw the finger of Providence in everything that had happened.\nAlas, for me! My irreverent French nature saw nothing but the finger of\nFinch--in Oscar's pocket.\n\nThe wedding-day was not then actually fixed. It was only generally\narranged that the marriage should take place in about six weeks.\n\nThis interval was intended to serve a double purpose. It was to give the\nlawyers time to prepare the marriage settlements, and to give Oscar time\nto completely recover his health. Some anxiety was felt by all of us on\nthis latter subject. His wound was well, and his mind was itself again.\nBut still there was something wrong with him, for all that.\n\nThose curious contradictions in his character which I have already\nmentioned, showed themselves more strangely than ever. The man who had\nfound the courage (when his blood was up) to measure himself alone and\nunarmed against two robbers, was now unable to enter the room in which\nthe struggle had taken place, without trembling from head to foot. He,\nwho had laughed at me when I begged him not to sleep in the house by\nhimself, now had two men (a gardener and an indoor servant) domiciled at\nBrowndown to protect him--and felt no sense of security even in that. He\nwas constantly dreaming that the ruffian with the \"life-preserver\" was\nattacking him again, or that he was lying bleeding on the floor and\ncoaxing Jicks to venture within reach of his hand. If any of us hinted at\nhis occupying himself once more with his favorite art, he stopped his\nears, and entreated us not to renew his horrible associations with the\npast. He would not even look at his box of chasing tools. The\ndoctor--summoned to say what was the matter with him--told us that his\nnervous system had been shaken, and frankly acknowledged that there was\nnothing to be done but to wait until time set it right again.\n\nI am afraid I must confess that I myself took no very indulgent view of\nthe patient's case.\n\nIt was his duty to exert himself--as I thought. He appeared to me to be\ntoo indolent to make a proper effort to better his own condition. Lucilla\nand I had more than one animated discussion about him. On a certain\nevening when we were at the piano gossiping, and playing in the\nintervals, she was downright angry with me for not sympathizing with her\ndarling as unreservedly as she did. \"I have noticed one thing, Madame\nPratolungo,\" she said to me, with a flushed face and a heightened tone.\n\"You have never done Oscar justice from the first.\"\n\n(Mark those trifling words. The time is coming when you will hear of them\nagain.)\n\nThe preparations for the contemplated marriage went on. The lawyers\nproduced their sketch of the settlement; and Oscar wrote (to an address\nin New York, given to him by Nugent) to tell his brother of the\napproaching change in his life, and of the circumstances which had\nbrought it about.\n\nThe marriage settlement was not shown to me; but, from certain signs and\ntokens, I guessed that Oscar's perfect disinterestedness on the question\nof money had been turned to profitable account by Oscar's future\nfather-in-law. Reverend Finch was reported to have shed tears when he\nfirst read the document. And Lucilla came out of the study, after an\ninterview with her father, more thoroughly and vehemently indignant than\nI had ever seen her yet. \"Don't ask what is the matter!\" she said to me\nbetween her teeth. \"I am ashamed to tell you.\" When Oscar came in, a\nlittle later, she fell on her knees--literally on her knees--before him.\nSome overmastering agitation was in possession of her whole being, which\nmade her, for the moment, reckless of what she said or did. \"I worship\nyou!\" she burst out hysterically, kissing his hand. \"You are the noblest\nof living men. I can never, never be worthy of you!\" The interpretation\nof these high-flown sayings and doings was, to my mind, briefly this:\nOscar's money in the rector's pocket, and the rector's daughter used as\nthe means.\n\nThe interval expired; the weeks succeeded each other. All had been long\nsince ready for the marriage--and still the marriage did not take place.\n\nFar from becoming himself again, with time to help him--as the doctor had\nforetold--Oscar steadily grew worse. All the nervous symptoms (to use the\nmedical phrase) which I have already described, strengthened instead of\nloosening their hold on him. He grew thinner and thinner, and paler and\npaler. Early in the month of November, we sent for the doctor again. The\nquestion to be put to him this time, was the question (suggested by\nLucilla) of trying as a last remedy change of air.\n\nSomething--I forget what--delayed the arrival of our medical man. Oscar\nhad given up all idea of seeing him that day, and had come to us at the\nrectory--when the doctor drove into Dimchurch. He was stopped before he\nwent on to Browndown; and he and his patient saw each other alone in\nLucilla's sitting-room.\n\nThey were a long time together. Lucilla, waiting with me in my\nbed-chamber, grew impatient. She begged me to knock at the sitting-room\ndoor, and inquire when she might be permitted to assist at the\nconsultation.\n\nI found doctor and patient standing together at the window, talking\nquietly. Evidently, nothing had passed to excite either of them in the\nsmallest degree. Oscar looked a little pale and weary--but he, like his\nmedical adviser, was perfectly composed.\n\n\"There is a young lady in the next room,\" I said, \"who is getting anxious\nto hear what your consultation has ended in.\"\n\nThe doctor looked at Oscar, and smiled.\n\n\"There is really nothing to tell Miss Finch,\" he said. \"Mr. Dubourg and I\nhave gone all over the case again--and nothing new has come of it. His\nnervous system has not recovered its balance so soon as I expected. I am\nsorry--but I am not in the least alarmed. At his age, things are sure to\ncome right in the end. He must be patient, and the young lady must be\npatient. I can say no more.\"\n\n\"Do you see any objection to his trying change of air?\" I inquired.\n\n\"None, whatever! Let him go where he likes, and amuse himself as he\nlikes. You are all of you a little disposed to take Mr. Dubourg's case\ntoo seriously. Except the nervous derangement (unpleasant enough in\nitself, I grant), there is really nothing the matter with him. He has not\na trace of organic disease anywhere. The pulse,\" continued the doctor,\nlaying his fingers lightly on Oscar's wrist, \"is perfectly satisfactory.\nI never felt a quieter pulse in my life.\"\n\nAs the words passed his lips, a frightful contortion fastened itself on\nOscar's face.\n\nHis eyes turned up hideously.\n\nFrom head to foot his whole body was wrenched round, as if giant hands\nhad twisted it, towards the right.\n\nBefore I could speak, he was in convulsions on the floor at his doctor's\nfeet.\n\n\"Good God, what is this!\" I cried out.\n\nThe doctor loosened his cravat, and moved away the furniture that was\nnear him. That done, he waited--looking at the writhing figure on the\nfloor.\n\n\"Can you do nothing more?\" I asked.\n\nHe shook his head gravely. \"Nothing more.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"An epileptic fit.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE SEVENTEENTH\n\nThe Doctor's Opinion\n\nBEFORE another word had been exchanged between us, Lucilla entered the\nroom. We looked at each other. If we could have spoken at that moment, I\nbelieve we should both have said, \"Thank God, she is blind!\"\n\n\"Have you all forgotten me?\" she asked. \"Oscar! where are you? What does\nthe doctor say?\"\n\nShe advanced into the room. In a moment more, she would have stumbled\nagainst the prostrate man still writhing on the floor. I laid my hand on\nher arm, and stopped her.\n\nShe suddenly caught my hand in hers. \"Why did you tremble,\" she asked,\n\"when you took me by the arm? Why are you trembling now?\" Her delicate\nsense of touch was not to be deceived. I vainly denied that anything had\nhappened: my hand had betrayed me. \"There is something wrong!\" she\nexclaimed, \"Oscar has not answered me.\"\n\nThe doctor came to my assistance.\n\n\"There is nothing to be alarmed about,\" he said. \"Mr. Dubourg is not very\nwell to-day.\"\n\nShe turned on the doctor, with a sudden burst of anger.\n\n\"You are deceiving me!\" she cried. \"Something serious has happened to\nhim. The truth! tell me the truth! Oh! it's shameful, it's heartless of\nboth of you to deceive a wretched blind creature like me!\"\n\nThe doctor still hesitated. I told her the truth.\n\n\"Where is he?\" she asked, seizing me by the two shoulders, and shaking me\nin the violence of her agitation.\n\nI entreated her to wait a little; I tried to place her in a chair. She\npushed me contemptuously away, and went down on the floor on her hands\nand knees. \"I shall find him,\" she said to herself; \"I shall find him in\nspite of them!\" She began to crawl over the floor, feeling the empty\nspace before her with her hand. It was horrible. I followed her, and\nraised her again, by main force.\n\n\"Don't struggle with her,\" said the doctor. \"Let her come here. He is\nquiet now.\"\n\nI looked at Oscar. The worst of it was over. He was exhausted--he was\nquite still now. The doctor's voice guided her to the place. She sat down\nby Oscar on the floor, and laid his head on her lap. The moment she\ntouched him, the same effect was produced on her which would be produced\n(if our eyes were bandaged) on you or me when the bandage was taken off.\nAn instant sense of relief diffused itself through her whole being. She\nbecame her gentler and sweeter self again. \"I am sorry I lost my temper,\"\nshe said with the simplicity of a child. \"But you don't know how hard it\nis to be deceived when you are blind.\" She stooped as she said those\nwords, and passed her handkerchief lightly over his forehead. \"Doctor,\"\nshe asked, \"will this happen again?\"\n\n\"I hope not.\"\n\n\"Are you sure not?\"\n\n\"I can't say that.\"\n\n\"What has brought it on?\"\n\n\"I am afraid the blow he received on the head has brought it on.\"\n\nShe asked no more questions; her eager face passed suddenly into a state\nof repose. Something seemed to have come into her mind--after the\ndoctor's answer to her own question--which absorbed her in herself. When\nOscar recovered his consciousness, she left it to me to answer the first\nnatural questions which he put. When he personally addressed her she\nspoke to him kindly, but briefly. Something in her, at that moment,\nseemed to keep her apart, even from _him._ When the doctor proposed\ntaking him back to Browndown, she did not insist, as I had anticipated,\non going with them. She took leave of him tenderly--but still she let him\ngo. While he yet lingered near the door, looking back at her, she moved\naway slowly to the further end of the room; self-withdrawn into her own\ndark world--shut up in her thoughts from him and from us.\n\nThe doctor tried to rouse her.\n\n\"You must not think too seriously of this,\" he said, following her to the\nwindow at which she stood, and dropping his voice so that Oscar could not\nhear him. \"He has himself told you that he feels lighter and better than\nhe felt before the fit. It has relieved instead of injuring him. There is\nno danger. I assure you, on my honor, there is nothing to fear.\"\n\n\"Can you assure me, on your honor, of one other thing,\" she asked,\nlowering her voice on her side. \"Can you honestly tell me that this is\nnot the first of other fits that are to come?\"\n\nThe doctor parried the question.\n\n\"We will have another medical opinion,\" he answered, \"before we decide.\nThe next time I go to see him, a physician from Brighton shall go with\nme.\"\n\nOscar, who had thus far waited, wondering at the change in her, now\nopened the door. The doctor returned to him. They left us.\n\nShe sat down on the window-seat, with her elbows on her knees and her\nhands grasping her forehead. A long moaning cry burst from her. She said\nto herself bitterly the one word--\"Farewell!\"\n\nI approached her; feeling the necessity of reminding her that I was in\nthe room.\n\n\"Farewell to what?\" I asked, taking my place by her side.\n\n\"To his happiness and to mine,\" she answered, without lifting her head\nfrom her hands. \"The dark days are coming for Oscar and for me.\"\n\n\"Why should you think that? You heard what the doctor said.\"\n\n\"The doctor doesn't know what I know.\"\n\n\"What do you know?\"\n\nShe paused before she answered me. \"Do you believe in fate?\" she said,\nsuddenly breaking the silence.\n\n\"I believe in nothing which encourages people to despair of themselves,\"\nI replied.\n\nShe went on without heeding me.\n\n\"What caused the fit which seized him in this room? The blow that struck\nhim on the head. How did he receive the blow? In trying to defend what\nwas his and what was mine. What had he been doing on the day when the\nthieves entered the house? He had been working on the casket which was\nmeant for me. Do you see those events linked together in one chain? I\nbelieve the fit will be followed by some next event springing out of it.\nSomething else is coming to darken his life and to darken mine. There is\nno wedding-day near for us. The obstacles are rising in front of him and\nin front of me. The next misfortune is very near us. You will see! you\nwill see!\" She shivered as she said those words; and, shrinking away from\nme, huddled herself up in a corner of the window-seat.\n\nIt was useless to dispute with her; and worse than useless to sit there,\nand encourage her to say more. I got up on my feet.\n\n\"There is one thing I believe in,\" I said cheerfully. \"I believe in the\nbreeze on the hills. Come for a walk!\"\n\nShe shrank closer into her corner and shook her head.\n\n\"Let me be!\" she broke out impatiently. \"Leave me by myself!\" She rose,\nrepenting the words the moment they were uttered--she put her arm round\nmy neck, and kissed me. \"I didn't mean to speak so harshly,\" said the\ngentle affectionate creature. \"Sister! my heart is heavy. My life to come\nnever looked so dark to my blind eyes as it looks now.\" A tear dropped\nfrom those poor sightless eyes on my cheek. She turned her head aside\nabruptly. \"Forgive me,\" she murmured, \"and let me go.\" Before I could\nanswer, she hurried away to hide herself in her room. The sweet girl! How\nyou would have pitied her--how you would have loved her!\n\nI went out alone for my walk. She had not infected me with her\nsuperstitious foreboding of ill things to come. But there was one sad\nword that she had said, in which I could not but agree. After what I had\nwitnessed in that room, the wedding-day did indeed look further off than\never.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE EIGHTEENTH\n\nFamily Troubles\n\nIN four or five days more, Lucilla's melancholy doubts about Oscar were\nconfirmed. He was attacked by a second fit.\n\nThe promised consultation with the physician from Brighton took place.\nOur new doctor did not encourage us to hope. The second fit following so\nclose on the first was, in his opinion, a bad sign. He gave general\ndirections for the treatment of Oscar; and left him to decide for himself\nwhether he would or would not try change of scene. No change, the\nphysician appeared to think, would exert any immediate influence on the\nrecurrence of the epileptic attacks. The patient's general health might\nbe benefited, and that was all. As for the question of the marriage, he\ndeclared without hesitation that we must for the present dismiss all\nconsideration of it from our minds.\n\nLucilla received the account of what passed at the visit of the doctors\nwith a stubborn resignation which it distressed me to see. \"Remember what\nI told you when the first attack seized him,\" she said. \"Our summer-time\nis ended; our winter is come.\"\n\nHer manner, while she spoke, was the manner of a person who is waiting\nwithout hope--who feels deliberately that calamity is near. She only\nroused herself when Oscar came in. He was, naturally enough, in miserable\nspirits, under the sudden alteration in all his prospects. Lucilla did\nher best to cheer him, and succeeded. On my side, I tried vainly to\npersuade him to leave Browndown and amuse himself in some gayer place. He\nshrank from new faces and new scenes. Between these two unelastic young\npeople, I felt even my native good spirits beginning to sink. If we had\nbeen all three down in the bottom of a dry well in a wilderness, we could\nhardly have surveyed a more dismal prospect than the prospect we were\ncontemplating now. By good luck, Oscar, like Lucilla, was passionately\nfond of music. We turned to the piano as our best resource in those days\nof our adversity. Lucilla and I took it in turns to play, and Oscar\nlistened. I have to report that we got through a great deal of music. I\nhave also to acknowledge that we were very dull.\n\n\n\nAs for Reverend Finch, he talked his way through his share of the\ntroubles that were trying us now, at the full compass of his voice.\n\nIf you had heard the little priest in those days, you would have supposed\nthat nobody could feel our domestic misfortunes as _he_ felt them, and\ngrieve over them as _he_ grieved. He was a sight to see, on the day of\nthe medical consultation; strutting up and down his wife's sitting-room,\nand haranguing his audience--composed of his wife and myself. Mrs. Finch\nsat in one corner, with the baby and the novel, and the petticoat and the\nshawl. I occupied the other corner; summoned to \"consult with the\nrector.\" In plain words, summoned to hear Mr. Finch declare that he was\nthe person principally overshadowed by the cloud which hung on the\nhousehold.\n\n\"I despair, Madame Pratolungo--I assure you, I despair--of conveying any\nidea of how _I_ feel under this most melancholy state of things. You have\nbeen very good; you have shown the sympathy of a true friend. But you\ncannot possibly understand how this blow has fallen on Me. I am crushed.\nMadame Pratolungo!\" (he appealed to me, in my corner); \"Mrs. Finch!\" (he\nappealed to his wife, in _her_ corner)--\"I am crushed. There is no other\nword to express it but the word I have used. Crushed.\" He stopped in the\nmiddle of the room. He looked expectantly at me--he looked expectantly at\nhis wife. His face and manner said plainly, \"If both these women faint, I\nshall consider it a natural and becoming proceeding on their parts, after\nwhat I have just told them.\" I waited for the lead of the lady of the\nhouse. Mrs. Finch did not roll prostrate, with the baby and the novel, on\nthe floor. Thus encouraged, I presumed to keep my seat. The rector still\nwaited for us. I looked as miserable as I could. Mrs. Finch cast her eyes\nup reverentially at her husband, as if she thought him the noblest of\ncreated beings, and silently put her handkerchief to her eyes. Mr. Finch\nwas satisfied; Mr. Finch went on. \"My health has suffered--I assure you,\nMadame Pratolungo, MY health has suffered. Since this sad occurrence, my\nstomach has given way. My balance is lost--my usual regularity is gone. I\nam subject--entirely through this miserable business--to fits of morbid\nappetite. I want things at wrong times--breakfast in the middle of the\nnight; dinner at four in the morning. I want something now!\" Mr. Finch\nstopped, horror-struck at his condition; pondering with his eyebrows\nfiercely knit, and his hand pressed convulsively on the lower buttons of\nhis rusty black waistcoat. Mrs. Finch's watery blue eyes looked across\nthe room at me, in a moist melancholy of conjugal distress. The rector,\nsuddenly enlightened after his consultation with his stomach, strutted to\nthe door, flung it wide open, and called down the kitchen stairs with a\nvoice of thunder, \"Poach me an egg!\" He came back into the room--held\nanother consultation, keeping his eyes severely fixed on me--strutted\nback in a furious hurry to the door--and bellowed a counter-order down\nthe kitchen-stairs, \"No egg! Do me a red herring!\" He came back for the\nsecond time, with his eyes closed and his hand laid distractedly on his\nhead. He appealed alternately to Mrs. Finch and to me. \"See for\nyourselves--Mrs. Finch! Madame Pratolungo!--see for yourselves what a\nstate I am in. It's simply pitiable. I hesitate about the most trifling\nthings. First, I think I want a poached egg--then, I think I want a red\nherring--now I don't know what I want. Upon my word of honor as a\nclergyman and a gentleman, I don't know what I want! Morbid appetite all\nday; morbid wakefulness all night--what a condition! I can't rest. I\ndisturb my wife at night. Mrs. Finch! I disturb you at night. How many\ntimes--since this misfortune fell upon us--do I turn in bed before I fall\noff to sleep? Eight times? Are you certain of it? Don't exaggerate! Are\nyou certain you counted! Very well: good creature! I never remember--I\nassure you, Madame Pratolungo, I never remember--such a complete upset as\nthis before. The nearest approach to it was some years since, at my\nwife's last confinement but four. Mrs. Finch! was it at your last\nconfinement but four? or your last but five? Your last but four? Are you\nsure. Are you certain you are not misleading our friend here? Very well:\ngood creature! Pecuniary difficulties, Madame Pratolungo, were at the\nbottom of it on that last occasion. I got over the pecuniary\ndifficulties. How am I to get over this? My plans for Oscar and Lucilla\nwere completely arranged. My relations with my wedded children were\npleasantly laid out. I saw my own future; I saw the future of my family.\nWhat do I see now? All, so to speak, annihilated at a blow. Inscrutable\nProvidence!\" He paused, and lifted his eyes and hands devotionally to the\nceiling. The cook appeared with the red herring. \"Inscrutable\nProvidence\"--proceeded Mr. Finch, a tone lower. \"Eat it, dear,\" said Mrs.\nFinch, \"while it's hot.\" The rector paused again. His unresting tongue\nurged him to proceed; his undisciplined stomach clamored for the herring.\nThe cook uncovered the dish. Mr. Finch's nose instantly sided with Mr.\nFinch's stomach. He stopped at \"Inscrutable Providence\"--and peppered his\nherring.\n\nHaving reported how the rector spoke, in the presence of the disaster\nwhich had fallen on the family, I have only to complete the picture by\nstating next what he did. He borrowed two hundred pounds of Oscar; and\nleft off commanding red herrings in the day and disturbing Mrs. Finch at\nnight, immediately afterwards.\n\n\n\nThe dull autumn days ended, and the long nights of winter began.\n\nNo change for the better appeared in our prospects. The doctors did their\nbest for Oscar--without avail. The horrible fits came back, again and\nagain. Day after day, our dull lives went monotonously on. I almost began\nnow to believe, with Lucilla, that a crisis of some sort must be at hand.\n\"This cannot last,\" I used to say to myself--generally when I was very\nhungry. \"Something will happen before the year comes to an end.\"\n\nThe month of December began; and something happened at last. The family\ntroubles at the rectory were matched by family troubles of my own. A\nletter arrived for me from one of my younger sisters at Paris. It\ncontained alarming news of a person very dear to me--already mentioned in\nthe first of these pages as my good Papa.\n\nWas the venerable author of my being dangerously ill of a mortal disease?\nAlas! he was not exactly that--but the next worst thing to it. He was\ndangerously in love with a disreputable young woman. At what age? At the\nage of seventy-five! What can we say of my surviving parent? We can only\nsay, This is a vigorous nature; Papa has an evergreen heart.\n\nI am grieved to trouble you with my family concerns. But they mix\nthemselves up intimately, as you will see in due time, with the concerns\nof Oscar and Lucilla. It is my unhappy destiny that I cannot possibly\ntake you through the present narrative, without sooner or later\ndisclosing the one weakness (amiable weakness) of the gayest and\nbrightest and best-preserved man of his time.\n\nAh, I am now treading on egg-shells, I know! The English specter called\nPropriety springs up rampant on my writing-table, and whispers furiously\nin my ear, \"Madame Pratolungo, raise a blush on the cheek of Innocence,\nand it is all over from that moment with you and your story.\" Oh,\ninflammable Cheek of Innocence, be good-natured for once, and I will rack\nmy brains to try if I can put it to you without offense! May I picture\ngood Papa as an elder in the Temple of Venus, burning incense\ninexhaustibly on the altar of love? No: Temple of Venus is Pagan; altar\nof love is not proper--take them out. Let me only say of my evergreen\nparent that his life from youth to age had been one unintermitting\nrecognition of the charms of the sex, and that my sisters and I (being of\nthe sex) could not find it in our hearts to abandon him on that account.\nSo handsome, so affectionate, so sweet-tempered; with only one fault--and\nthat a compliment to the women, who naturally adored him in return! We\naccepted our destiny. For years past (since the death of Mamma), we\naccustomed ourselves to live in perpetual dread of his marrying some one\nof the hundreds of unscrupulous hussies who took possession of him: and,\nworse if possible than that, of his fighting duels about them with men\nyoung enough to be his grandsons. Papa was so susceptible! Papa was so\nbrave! Over and over again, I had been summoned to interfere, as the\ndaughter who had the strongest influence over him. I had succeeded in\neffecting his rescue, now by one means, and now by another; ending\nalways, however, in the same sad way, by the sacrifice of money for\ndamages--on which damages, when the woman is shameless enough to claim\nthem, my verdict is, \"Serve her right!\"\n\nOn the present occasion, it was the old story over again. My sisters had\ndone their best to stop it, and had failed. I had no choice but to appear\non the scene--to begin, perhaps, by boxing her ears: to end, certainly,\nby filling her pockets.\n\nMy absence at this time was something more than an annoyance--it was a\ndownright grief to my blind Lucilla. On the morning of my departure, she\nclung to me as if she was determined not to let me go.\n\n\"What shall I do without you?\" she said. \"It is hard, in these dreary\ndays, to lose the comfort of hearing your voice. I shall feel all my\nsecurity gone, when I feel you no longer near me. How many days shall you\nbe away?\"\n\n\"A day to get to Paris,\" I answered; \"and a day to get back--two. Five\ndays (if I can do it in the time) to thunder-strike the hussy, and to\nrescue Papa--seven. Let us say, if possible, a week.\"\n\n\"You must be back, no matter what happen, before the new year.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I have my yearly visit to pay to my aunt. It has been twice put off. I\nmust absolutely go to London on the last day of the old year, and stay\nthere my allotted three months in Miss Batchford's house. I had hoped to\nbe Oscar's wife before the time came round again----\" she waited a moment\nto steady her voice. \"That is all over now. We must be parted. If I can't\nleave you here to console him and to take care of him, come what may of\nit--I shall stay at Dimchurch.\"\n\nHer staying at Dimchurch, while she was still unmarried, meant (under the\nterms of her uncle's will) sacrificing her fortune. If Reverend Finch had\nheard her, he would not even have been able to say \"Inscrutable\nProvidence\"--he would have lost his senses on the spot.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" I said; \"I shall be back, Lucilla, before you go.\nBesides, Oscar may get better. He may be able to follow you to London,\nand visit you at your aunt's.\"\n\nShe shook her head, with such a sad, sad doubt of it, that the tears came\ninto my eyes. I gave her a last kiss--and hurried away.\n\nMy route was to Newhaven, and then across the Channel to Dieppe. I don't\nthink I really knew how fond I had grown of Lucilla, until I lost sight\nof the rectory at the turn in the road to Brighton. My natural firmness\ndeserted me; I felt torturing presentiments that some great misfortune\nwould happen in my absence; I astonished myself--I, the widow of the\nSpartan Pratolungo!--by having a good cry, like any other woman.\n\nSooner or later, we susceptible people pay with the heartache for the\nprivilege of loving. No matter: heartache or not, one must have something\nto love in this world as long as one lives in it. I have lived in\nit--never mind how many years--and I have got Lucilla. Before Lucilla I\nhad the Doctor. Before the Doctor--ah, my friends, we won't look back\nbeyond the Doctor!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE NINETEENTH\n\nSecond Result of the Robbery\n\nTHE history of my proceedings in Paris can be dismissed in a very few\nwords. It is only necessary to dwell in detail on one among the many\nparticulars which connect themselves in my memory with the rescue of good\nPapa.\n\nThe affair, this time, assumed the gravest possible aspect. The venerable\nvictim had gone the length of renewing his youth, in respect of his\nteeth, his hair, his complexion, and his figure (this last involving the\npurchase of a pair of stays). I declare I hardly knew him again, he was\nso outrageously and unnaturally young. The utmost stretch of my influence\nwas exerted over him in vain. He embraced me with the most touching\nfervour; he expressed the noblest sentiments--but in the matter of his\ncontemplated marriage, he was immovable. Life was only tolerable to him\non one condition. The beloved object, or death--such was the programme of\nthis volcanic old man.\n\nTo make the prospect more hopeless still, the beloved object proved, on\nthis occasion, to be a bold enough woman to play her trump card at\nstarting.\n\nI give the jade her due. She assumed a perfectly unassailable attitude:\nwe had her full permission to break off the match--if we could. \"I refer\nyou to your father. Pray understand that I don't wish to marry him, if\nhis daughters object to it. He has only to say, 'Release me.' From that\nmoment he is free.\" There was no contending against such a system of\ndefence as this. We knew as well as she did that our fascinated parent\nwould not say the word. Our one chance was to spend money in\ninvestigating the antecedent indiscretions of the lady's life, and to\nproduce against her proof so indisputable that not even an old man's\ninfatuation could say, This is a lie.\n\nWe disbursed; we investigated; we secured our proof. It took a fortnight.\nAt the end of that time, we had the necessary materials in hand for\nopening the eyes of good Papa.\n\nIn the course of the inquiry I was brought into contact with many strange\npeople--among others, with a man who startled me, at our first interview,\nby presenting a personal deformity, which, with all my experience of the\nworld, I now saw oddly enough for the first time.\n\nThe man's face, instead of exhibiting any of the usual shades of\ncomplexion, was hideously distinguished by a superhuman--I had almost\nsaid a devilish--colouring of livid blackish _blue!_ He proved to be a\nmost kind, intelligent, and serviceable person. But when we first\nconfronted each other, his horrible color so startled me, that I could\nnot repress a cry of alarm. He not only passed over my involuntary act of\nrudeness in the most indulgent manner--he explained to me the cause which\nhad produced his peculiarity of complexion; so as to put me at my ease\nbefore we entered on the delicate private inquiry which had brought us\ntogether.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said this unfortunate man, \"for not having warned\nyou of my disfigurement, before I entered the room. There are hundreds of\npeople discolored as I am, in the various parts of the civilized world;\nand I supposed that you had met, in the course of your experience, with\nother examples of my case. The blue tinge in my complexion is produced by\nthe effect on the blood of Nitrate of Silver--taken internally. It is the\nonly medicine which relieves sufferers like me from an otherwise\nincurable malady. We have no alternative but to accept the consequences\nfor the sake of the cure.\"\n\nHe did not mention what his malady had been; and I abstained, it is\nneedless to say, from questioning him further. I got used to his\ndisfigurement in the course of my relations with him; and I should no\ndoubt have forgotten my blue man in attending to more absorbing matters\nof interest, if the effects of Nitrate of Silver as a medicine had not\nbeen once more unexpectedly forced on my attention, in another quarter,\nand under circumstances which surprised me in no ordinary degree.\n\nHaving saved Papa on the brink of--let us say, his twentieth precipice,\nit was next necessary to stay a few days longer and reconcile him to the\nhardship of being rescued in spite of himself. You would have been\ngreatly shocked, if you had seen how he suffered. He gnashed his\nexpensive teeth; he tore his beautifully manufactured hair. In the\nfervour of his emotions, I have no doubt he would have burst his new\nstays--if I had not taken them away, and sold them half-price, and made\n(to that small extent) a profit out of our calamity to set against the\nloss. Do what one may in the detestable system of modern society, the\npivot on which it all turns is Money. Money, when you are saving Freedom!\nMoney, when you are saving Papa! Is there no remedy for this? A word in\nyour ear. Wait till the next revolution!\n\nDuring the time of my absence, I had of course corresponded with Lucilla.\n\nHer letters to me--very sad and very short--reported a melancholy state\nof things at Dimchurch. While I had been away, the dreadful epileptic\nseizures had attacked Oscar with increasing frequency and increasing\nseverity. The moment I could see my way to getting back to England, I\nwrote to Lucilla to cheer her with the intimation of my return. Two days\nonly before my departure from Paris, I received another letter from her.\nI was weak enough to be almost afraid to open it. Her writing to me\nagain, when she knew that we should be re-united at such an early date,\nsuggested that she must have some very startling news to communicate. My\nmind misgave me that it would prove to be news of the worst sort.\n\nI summoned courage to open the envelope. Ah, what fools we are! For once\nthat our presentments come right, they prove a hundred times to be wrong.\nInstead of distressing me, the letter delighted me. Our gloomy prospect\nwas brightening at last.\n\nThus--feeling her way over the paper, in her large childish\ncharacters--Lucilla wrote:\n\n\"DEAREST FRIEND AND SISTER,--I cannot wait until we meet, to tell you my\ngood news. The Brighton doctor has been dismissed; and a doctor from\nLondon has been tried instead. My dear! for intellect there is nothing\nlike London. The new man sees, thinks, and makes up his mind on the spot.\nHe has a way of his own of treating Oscar's case; and he answers for\ncuring him of the horrible fits. There is news for you! Come back, and\nlet us jump for joy together. How wrong I was to doubt the future! Never,\nnever, never will I doubt it again. This is the longest letter I have\never written.\n\n\"Your affectionate,\n\n\"LUCILLA.\"\n\nTo this, a postscript was added, in Oscar's handwriting, as follows:--\n\n\"Lucilla has told you that there is some hope for me at last. What I\nwrite in this place is written without her knowledge--for your private\near only. Take the first opportunity you can find of coming to see me at\nBrowndown, without allowing Lucilla to hear of it. I have a great favor\nto ask of you. My happiness depends on your granting it. You shall know\nwhat it is, when we meet.\n\n\"OSCAR.\"\n\nThis postscript puzzled me.\n\nIt was not in harmony with the implicit confidence which I had observed\nOscar to place habitually in Lucilla. It jarred on my experience of his\ncharacter, which presented him to me as the reverse of a reserved\nsecretive man. His concealment of his identity, when he first came among\nus, had been a forced concealment--due entirely to his horror of being\nidentified with the hero of the trial. In all the ordinary relations of\nlife, he was open and unreserved to a fault. That he could have a secret\nto keep from Lucilla, and to confide to me, was something perfectly\nunintelligible to my mind. It highly excited my curiosity; it gave me a\nnew reason for longing to get back.\n\nI was able to make all my arrangements, and to bid adieu to my father and\nmy sisters on the evening of the twenty-third. Early on the morning of\nthe twenty-fourth, I left Paris, and reached Dimchurch in time for the\nfinal festivities in celebration of Christmas Eve.\n\nThe first hour of Christmas Day had struck on the clock in our own pretty\nsitting-room, before I could prevail upon Lucilla to let me rest, after\nmy journey, in bed. She was now once more the joyous light-hearted\ncreature of our happier time; and she had so much to say to me, that not\neven her father himself (on this occasion) could have talked her down.\nThe next morning she paid the penalty of exciting herself over-night.\nWhen I went into her room, she was suffering from a nervous head-ache,\nand was not able to rise at her usual hour. She proposed of her own\naccord that I should go alone to Browndown to see Oscar on my return. It\nis only doing common justice to myself to say that this was a relief to\nme. If she had had the use of her eyes, my conscience would have been\neasy enough--but I shrank from deceiving my dear blind girl, even in the\nslightest things.\n\nSo, with Lucilla's knowledge and approval, I went to Oscar alone.\n\nI found him fretful and anxious--ready to flame out into one of his\nsudden passions, on the smallest provocation. Not the slightest\nreflection of Lucilla's recovered cheerfulness appeared in Lucilla's\nlover.\n\n\"Has she said anything to you about the new doctor?\" were the first words\nhe addressed to me.\n\n\"She has told me that she feels the greatest faith in him,\" I answered.\n\"She firmly believes that he speaks the truth in saying he can cure you.\"\n\n\"Did she show any curiosity to know _how_ he is curing me?\"\n\n\"Not the slightest curiosity that I could see. It is enough for her that\nyou _are_ to be cured. The rest she leaves to the doctor.\"\n\nMy last answer appeared to relieve him. He sighed, and leaned back in his\nchair. \"That's right!\" he said to himself. \"I'm glad to hear that.\"\n\n\"Is the doctor's treatment of you a secret?\" I asked.\n\n\"It must be a secret from Lucilla,\" he said, speaking very earnestly. \"If\nshe attempts to find it out, she must be kept--for the present, at\nleast--from all knowledge of it. Nobody has any influence over her but\nyou. I look to you to help me.\"\n\n\"Is this the favor you had to ask me?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Am I to know the secret of the medical treatment?\"\n\n\"Certainly! How can I expect you to help me unless you know what a\nserious reason there is for keeping Lucilla in the dark.\"\n\nHe laid a strong emphasis on the two words \"serious reason.\" I began to\nfeel a little uneasy. I had never yet taken the slightest advantage of my\npoor Lucilla's blindness. And here was her promised husband--of all the\npeople in the world--proposing to me to keep her in the dark.\n\n\"Is the new doctor's treatment dangerous?\" I inquired.\n\n\"Not in the least.\"\n\n\"Is it not so certain as he has led Lucilla to believe?\"\n\n\"It is quite certain.\n\n\"Did the other doctors know of it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why did they not try it?\"\n\n\"They were afraid.\"\n\n\"Afraid? What _is_ the treatment?\"\n\n\"Medicine.\"\n\n\"Many medicines? or one?\"\n\n\"Only one.\"\n\n\"What is the name of it?\"\n\n\"Nitrate of Silver.\"\n\nI started to my feet, looked at him, and dropped back into my chair.\n\nMy mind reverted, the instant I recovered myself, to the effect produced\non me when the blue man in Paris first entered my presence. In informing\nme of the effect of the medicine, he had (you will remember) concealed\nfrom me the malady for which he had taken it. It had been left to Oscar,\nof all the people in the world, to enlighten me--and that by a reference\nto his own case! I was so shocked that I sat speechless.\n\nWith his quick sensibilities, there was no need for me to express myself\nin words. My face revealed to him what was passing in my mind.\n\n\"You have seen a person who has taken Nitrate of Silver!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Have _you?_\" I asked.\n\n\"I know the price I pay for being cured,\" he answered quietly.\n\nHis composure staggered me. \"How long have you been taking this horrible\ndrug?\" I inquired.\n\n\"A little more than a week.\"\n\n\"I see no change in you yet.\"\n\n\"The doctor tells me there will be no visible change for weeks and weeks\nto come.\"\n\nThose words roused a momentary hope in me. \"There is time to alter your\nmind,\" I said. \"For heaven's sake reconsider your resolution before it is\ntoo late!\"\n\nHe smiled bitterly. \"Weak as I am,\" he answered, \"for once, my mind is\nmade up.\"\n\nI suppose I took a woman's view of the matter. I lost my temper when I\nlooked at his beautiful complexion and thought of the future.\n\n\"Are you in your right senses?\" I burst out. \"Do you mean to tell me that\nyou are deliberately bent on making yourself an object of horror to\neverybody who sees you?\"\n\n\"The one person whose opinion I care for,\" he replied, \"will never see\nme.\"\n\nI understood him at last. _That_ was the consideration which had\nreconciled him to it!\n\nLucilla's horror of dark people and dark shades of color, of all kinds,\nwas, it is needless to say, recalled to my memory by the turn the\nconversation was taking now. Had she confessed it to him, as she had\nconfessed it to me? No! I remembered that she had expressly warned me not\nto admit him into our confidence in this matter. At an early period of\ntheir acquaintance, she had asked him which of his parents he resembled.\nThis led him into telling her that his father had been a dark man.\nLucilla's delicacy had at once taken the alarm. \"He speaks very tenderly\nof his dead father,\" she said to me. \"It may hurt him if he finds out the\nantipathy I have to dark people. Let us keep it to ourselves.\" As things\nnow were, it was on the tip of my tongue to remind him, that Lucilla\nwould hear of his disfigurement from other people; and then to warn him\nof the unpleasant result that might follow. On reflection, however, I\nthought it wiser to wait a little and sound his motives first.\n\n\"Before you tell me how I can help you,\" I said, \"I want to know one\nthing more. Have you decided in this serious matter entirely by yourself?\nHave you taken no advice?\"\n\n\"I don't want advice,\" he answered sharply. \"My case admits of no choice.\nEven such a nervous undecided creature as I am, can judge for himself\nwhere there is no alternative.\"\n\n\"Did the doctors tell you there was no alternative?\" I asked.\n\n\"The doctors were afraid to tell me. I had to force it out of them. I\nsaid, 'I appeal to your honor to answer a plain question plainly. Is\nthere any certain prospect of my getting the better of the fits?' They\nonly said, 'At your time of life, we may reasonably hope so.' I pressed\nthem closer:--'Can you fix a date to which I may look forward as the date\nof my deliverance?' They could neither of them do it. All they could say\nwas, 'Our experience justifies us in believing that you will grow out of\nit; but it does _not_ justify us in saying when.' 'Then, I may be years\ngrowing out of it?' They were obliged to own that it might be so. 'Or I\nmay never grow out of it, at all?' They tried to turn the conversation. I\nwouldn't have it. I said, 'Tell me honestly, is that one of the\npossibilities, in my case?' The Dimchurch doctor looked at the London\ndoctor. The London man said, 'If you will have it, it is one of the\npossibilities.' Just consider the prospect which his answer placed before\nme! Day after day, week after week, month after month, always in danger,\ngo where I may, of falling down in a fit--is that a miserable position?\nor is it not?\"\n\nHow could I answer him? What could I say?\n\nHe went on:--\n\n\"Add to that wretched state of things that I am engaged to be married.\nThe hardest disappointment which can fall on a man, falls on me. The\nhappiness of my life is within my reach--and I am forbidden to enjoy it.\nIt is not only my health that is broken up, my prospects in life are\nruined as well. The woman I love is a woman forbidden to me while I\nsuffer as I suffer now. Realize that--and then fancy you see a man\nsitting at this table here, with pen, ink, and paper before him, who has\nonly to scribble a line or two, and to begin the cure of you from that\nmoment. Deliverance in a few months from the horror of the fits; marriage\nin a few months to the woman you love. That heavenly prospect in exchange\nfor the hellish existence that you are enduring now. And the one price to\npay for it, a discolored face for the rest of your life--which the one\nperson who is dearest to you will never see? Would you have hesitated?\nWhen the doctor took up the pen to write the prescription--tell me, if\nyou had been in my place, would you have said, No?\"\n\nI still sat silent. My obstinacy--women are such mules!--declined to give\nway, even when my conscience told me that he was right.\n\nHe sprang to his feet, in the same fever of excitement which I remembered\nso well, when I had irritated him at Browndown into telling me who he\nreally was.\n\n\"Would you have said, No?\" he reiterated, stooping over me, flushed and\nheated, as he had stooped on that first occasion, when he had whispered\nhis name in my ear. \"Would you?\" he repeated, louder and louder--\"would\nyou?\"\n\nAt the third reiteration of the words, the frightful contortion that I\nknew so well, seized on his face. The wrench to the right twisted his\nbody. He dropped at my feet. Good God! who could have declared that he\nwas wrong, with such an argument in his favor as I saw at that moment?\nWho would not have said that any disfigurement would be welcome as a\nrefuge from this?\n\nThe servant ran in, and helped me to move the furniture to a safe\ndistance from him, \"There won't be much more of it, ma'am,\" said the man,\nnoticing my agitation, and trying to compose me. \"In a month or two, the\ndoctor says the medicine will get hold of him.\" I could say nothing on my\nside--I could only reproach myself bitterly for disputing with him and\nexciting him, and leading perhaps to the hideous seizure which had\nattacked him in my presence for the second time.\n\nThe fit on this occasion was a short one. Perhaps the drug was already\nbeginning to have some influence over him? In twenty minutes, he was able\nto resume his chair, and to go on talking to me.\n\n\"You think I shall horrify you when my face has turned blue,\" he said\nwith a faint smile. \"Don't I horrify you now when you see me in\nconvulsions on the floor?\"\n\nI entreated him to dwell on it no more.\n\n\"God knows,\" I said, \"you have convinced me--obstinate as I am. Let us\ntry to think of nothing now but of the prospect of your being cured. What\ndo you wish me to do?\"\n\n\"You have great influence over Lucilla,\" he said. \"If she expresses any\ncuriosity, in future conversations with you, about the effect of the\nmedicine, check her at once. Keep her as ignorant of it as she is now!\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Why! If she knows what you know, how will she feel? Shocked and\nhorrified, as you felt. What will she do? She will come straight here,\nand try, as you have tried, to persuade me to give it up. Is that true or\nnot?\"\n\n(Impossible to deny that it was true.)\n\n\"I am so fond of her,\" he went on, \"that I can refuse her nothing. She\nwould end in making me give it up. The instant her back was turned, I\nshould repent my own weakness, and return to the medicine. Here is a\nperpetual struggle in prospect, for a man who is already worn out. Is it\ndesirable, after what you have just seen, to expose me to that?\"\n\nIt would have been useless cruelty to expose him to it. How could I do\notherwise than consent to make his sacrifice of himself--his _necessary_\nsacrifice--as easy as I could? At the same time, I implored him to\nremember one thing.\n\n\"Mind,\" I said, \"we can never hope to keep her in ignorance of the change\nin you, when the change comes. Sooner or later, some one will let the\nsecret out.\"\n\n\"I only want it to be concealed from her while the disfigurement of me is\nin progress,\" he answered. \"When nothing she can say or do will alter\nit--I will tell her myself. She is so happy in the hope of my recovery!\nWhat good can be gained by telling her beforehand of the penalty that I\npay for my deliverance? My ugly color will never terrify my poor darling.\nAs for other persons, I shall not force myself on the view of the world.\nIt is my one wish to live out of the world. The few people about me will\nsoon get reconciled to my face. Lucilla will set them the example. She\nwon't trouble herself long about a change in me that she can neither feel\nnor see.\"\n\nOught I to have warned him here of Lucilla's inveterate prejudice, and of\nthe difficulty there might be in reconciling her to the change in him\nwhen she heard of it? I dare say I ought, I daresay I was to blame in\nshrinking from inflicting new anxieties and new distresses on a man who\nhad already suffered so much. The simple truth is--I could not do it.\nWould you have done it? Ah, if you would, I hope I may never come in\ncontact with you. What a horrid wretch you must be! The end of it was\nthat I left the house--pledged to keep Lucilla in ignorance of the cost\nat which Oscar had determined to purchase his cure, until Oscar thought\nfit to enlighten her himself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TWENTIETH\n\nGood Papa again!\n\nTHE promise I had given did not expose me to the annoyance of being kept\nlong on the watch against accidents. If we could pass safely over the\nnext five days, we might feel pretty sure of the future. On the last day\nof the old year, Lucilla was bound by the terms of the will to go to\nLondon, and live her allotted three months under the roof of her aunt.\n\nIn the brief interval that elapsed before her departure, she twice\napproached the dangerous subject.\n\nOn the first occasion, she asked me if I knew what medicine Oscar was\ntaking. I pleaded ignorance, and passed at once to other matters. On the\nsecond occasion, she advanced still further on the way to discovery of\nthe truth. She now inquired if I had heard how the physic worked the\ncure. Having been already informed that the fits proceeded from a certain\ndisordered condition of the brain, she was anxious to know whether the\nmedical treatment was likely to affect the patient's head. This question\n(which I was of course unable to answer) she put to both the doctors.\nAlready warned by Oscar, they quieted her by declaring that the process\nof cure acted by general means, and did not attack the head. From that\nmoment, her curiosity was satisfied. Her mind had other objects of\ninterest to dwell on, before she left Dimchurch. She touched on the\nperilous topic no more.\n\nIt was arranged that I was to accompany Lucilla to London. Oscar was to\nfollow us, when the state of his health permitted him to take the\njourney. As betrothed husband of Lucilla, he had his right of entry,\nduring her residence in her aunt's house. As for me, I was admitted at\nLucilla's intercession. She declined to be separated from me for three\nmonths.\n\nMiss Batchford wrote, most politely, to offer me a hospitable welcome\nduring the day. She had no second spare-room at her disposal--so we\nsettled that I was to sleep at a lodging-house in the neighborhood. In\nthis same house, Oscar was also to be accommodated, when the doctors\nsanctioned his removal to London. It was now thought likely--if all went\nwell--that the marriage might be celebrated at the end of the three\nmonths, from Miss Batchford's residence in town.\n\nThree days before the date of Lucilla's departure, these plans--so far as\nI was concerned in them--were all over-thrown.\n\nA letter from Paris reached me, with more bad news. My absence had\nproduced the worst possible effect on good Papa.\n\nThe moment my influence had been removed, he had become perfectly\nunmanageable. My sisters assured me that the abominable woman from whom I\nhad rescued him, would most certainly end in marrying him after all,\nunless I reappeared immediately on the scene. What was to be done?\nNothing was to be done, but to fly into a rage--to grind my teeth, and\nthrow down all my things, in the solitude of my own room--and then to go\nback to Paris.\n\nLucilla behaved charmingly. When she saw how angry and how distressed I\nwas, she suppressed all exhibition of disappointment on her side, with\nthe truest and kindest consideration for my feelings. \"Write to me\noften,\" said the charming creature, \"and come back to me as soon as you\ncan.\" Her father took her to London. Two days before they left, I said\ngood-bye at the rectory and at Browndown; and started--once more by the\nNewhaven and Dieppe route--for Paris.\n\nI was in no humour (as your English saying is) to mince matters, in\ncontrolling this new outbreak on the part of my evergreen parent. I\ninsisted on instantly removing him from Paris, and taking him on a\ncontinental tour. I was proof against his paternal embraces; I was deaf\nto his noble sentiments. He declared he should die on the road. When I\nlook back at it now, I am amazed at my own cruelty. I said, \"En route,\nPapa!\"--and packed him up, and took him to Italy.\n\nHe became enamored, at intervals, now of one fair traveler and now of\nanother, all through the journey from Paris to Rome. (Wonderful old man!)\nArrived at Rome--that hotbed of the enemies of mankind--I saw my way to\nputting a moral extinguisher on the author of my being. The Eternal City\ncontains three hundred and sixty-five churches, and (say) three million\nand sixty-five pictures. I insisted on his seeing them all--at the\nadvanced age of seventy-five years! The sedative result followed, exactly\nas I had anticipated. I stupefied good Papa with churches and\npictures--and then I tried him with a marble woman to begin with. He fell\nasleep before the Venus of the Capitol. When I saw that, I said to\nmyself, Now he will do; Don Juan is reformed at last.\n\nLucilla's correspondence with me--at first cheerful--gradually assumed a\ndesponding tone.\n\nSix weeks had passed since her departure from Dimchurch; and still\nOscar's letters held out no hope of his being able to join her in London.\nHis recovery was advancing, but not so rapidly as his medical adviser had\nanticipated. It was possible--to look the worst in the face boldly--that\nhe might not get the doctor's permission to leave Browndown before the\ntime arrived for Lucilla's return to the rectory. In this event, he could\nonly entreat her to be patient, and to remember that though he was\ngaining ground but slowly, he was still getting on. Under these\ncircumstances, Lucilla was naturally vexed and dejected. She had never\n(she wrote), from her girlhood upward, spent such a miserable time with\nher aunt as she was spending now.\n\nOn reading this letter, I instantly smelt something wrong.\n\nI corresponded with Oscar almost as frequently as with Lucilla. His last\nletter to me flatly contradicted his last letter to his promised wife. In\nwriting to my address, he declared himself to be rapidly advancing\ntowards recovery. Under the new treatment, the fits succeeded each other\nat longer and longer intervals, and endured a shorter and shorter time.\nHere then was plainly a depressing report sent to Lucilla, and an\nencouraging report sent to me.\n\nWhat did it mean?\n\nOscar's next letter to me answered the question.\n\n\"I told you in my last\" (he wrote), \"that the discoloration of my skin\nhad begun. The complexion which you were once so good as to admire, has\ndisappeared for ever. I am now of a livid ashen color--so like death,\nthat I sometimes startle myself when I look in the glass. In about six\nweeks more, as the doctor calculates, this will deepen to a blackish\nblue; and then, 'the saturation' (as he calls it) will be complete.\n\n\"So far from feeling any useless regrets at having taken the medicine\nwhich is producing these ugly effects, I am more grateful to my Nitrate\nof Silver than words can say. If you ask for the secret of this\nextraordinary exhibition of philosophy on my part, I can give it in one\nline. For the last ten days, I have not had a fit. In other words, for\nthe last ten days, I have lived in Paradise. I declare I would have\ncheerfully lost an arm or a leg to gain the blessed peace of mind, the\nintoxicating confidence in the future--it is nothing less--that I feel\nnow.\n\n\"Still there is a drawback which prevents me from enjoying perfect\ntranquillity even yet. When was there ever a pleasure in this world,\nwithout a lurking possibility of pain hidden away in it somewhere?\n\n\"I have lately discovered a peculiarity in Lucilla which is new to me,\nand which has produced a very unpleasant impression on my mind. My\nproposed avowal to her of the change in my personal appearance, has now\nbecome a matter of far more serious difficulty than I had anticipated\nwhen the question was discussed between you and me at Browndown.\n\n\"Have you ever found out that the strongest antipathy she has, is her\npurely imaginary antipathy to dark people and to dark shades of color of\nall kinds? This strange prejudice is the result, as I suppose, of some\nmorbid growth of her blindness, quite as inexplicable to herself as to\nother people. Explicable, or not, there it is in her. Read the extract\nthat follows from one of her letters to her father, which her father\nshowed to me--and you will not be surprised to hear that I tremble for\nmyself when the time comes for telling her what I have done.\n\n\"Thus she writes to Mr. Finch:--\n\n\"'I am sorry to say, I have had a little quarrel with my aunt. It is all\nmade up now, but it has hardly left us such good friends as we were\nbefore. Last week, there was a dinner-party here; and, among the guests,\nwas a Hindoo gentleman (converted to Christianity) to whom my aunt has\ntaken a great fancy. While the maid was dressing me, I unluckily inquired\nif she had seen the Hindoo--and, hearing that she had, I still more\nunfortunately asked her to tell me what he was like. She described him as\nbeing very tall and lean, with a dark brown complexion and glittering\nblack eyes. My mischievous fancy instantly set to work on this horrid\ncombination of darknesses. Try as I might to resist it, my mind drew a\ndreadful picture of the Hindoo, as a kind of monster in human form. I\nwould have given worlds to have been excused from going down into the\ndrawing-room. At the last moment I was sent for, and the Hindoo was\nintroduced to me. The instant I felt him approaching, my darkness was\npeopled with brown demons. He took my hand. I tried hard to control\nmyself--but I really could not help shuddering and starting back when he\ntouched me. To make matters worse, he sat next to me at dinner. In five\nminutes I had long, lean, black-eyed beings all round me; perpetually\ngrowing in numbers, and pressing closer and closer on me as they grew. It\nended in my being obliged to leave the table. When the guests were all\ngone, my aunt was furious. I admitted my conduct was unreasonable in the\nlast degree. At the same time, I begged her to make allowances for me. I\nreminded her that I was blind at a year old, and that I had really no\nidea of what any person was like, except by drawing pictures of them in\nmy imagination, from description, and from my own knowledge obtained by\ntouch. I appealed to her to remember that, situated as I am, my fancy is\npeculiarly liable to play me tricks, and that I have no sight to see\nwith, and to show me--as other people's eyes show _them_--when they have\ntaken a false view of persons and things. It was all in vain. My aunt\nwould admit of no excuse for me. I was so irritated by her injustice,\nthat I reminded her of an antipathy of her own, quite as ridiculous as\nmine--an antipathy to cats. She, who can see that cats are harmless,\nshudders and turns pale, for all that, if a cat is in the same room with\nher. Set my senseless horror of dark people against her senseless horror\nof cats--and say which of us has the right to be angry with the other?'\"\n\nSuch was the quotation from Lucilla's letter to her father. At the end of\nit, Oscar resumed, as follows:--\n\n\"I wonder whether you will now understand me, if I own to you that I have\nmade the worst of my case in writing to Lucilla? It is the only excuse I\ncan produce for not joining her in London. Weary as I am of our long\nseparation, I cannot prevail on myself to run the risk of meeting her in\nthe presence of strangers, who would instantly notice my frightful color,\nand betray it to her. Think of her shuddering and starting back from my\nhand when it took hers! No! no! I must choose my own opportunity, in this\nquiet place, of telling her what (I suppose) must be told--with time\nbefore me to prepare her mind for the disclosure (if it must come), and\nwith nobody but you near to see the first mortifying effect of the shock\nwhich I shall inflict on her.\n\n\"I have only to add, before I release you, that I write these lines in\nthe strictest confidence. You have promised not to mention my\ndisfigurement to Lucilla, unless I first give you leave. I now, more than\never, hold you to that promise. The few people about me here, are all\npledged to secrecy as you are. If it is really inevitable that she should\nknow the truth--I alone must tell it; in my own way, and at my own time.\"\n\n\n\n\"If it must come,\" \"if it is really inevitable\"--these phrases in Oscar's\nletter satisfied me that he was already beginning to comfort himself with\nan insanely delusive idea--the idea that it might be possible permanently\nto conceal the ugly personal change in him from Lucilla's knowledge.\n\nIf I had been at Dimchurch, I have no doubt I should have begun to feel\nseriously uneasy at the turn which things appeared to be taking now.\n\nBut distance has a very strange effect in altering one's customary way of\nthinking of affairs at home. Being in Italy instead of in England, I\ndismissed Lucilla's antipathies and Oscar's scruples, as both alike\nunworthy of serious consideration. Sooner or later, time (I considered)\nwould bring these two troublesome young people to their senses. Their\nmarriage would follow, and there would be an end of it! In the meanwhile,\nI continued to feast good Papa on Holy Families and churches. Ah, poor\ndear, how he yawned over Caraccis and cupolas! and how fervently he\npromised never to fall in love again, if I would only take him back to\nParis!\n\nWe set our faces homeward a day or two after the receipt of Oscar's\nletter. I left my reformed father, resting his aching old bones in his\nown easy-chair; capable perhaps, even yet, of contracting a Platonic\nattachment to a lady of his own time of life--but capable (as I firmly\nbelieved) of nothing more. \"Oh, my child, let me rest!\" he said, when I\nwished him good-bye. \"And never show me a church or a picture again as\nlong as I live!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIRST\n\nMadame Pratolungo Returns to Dimchurch\n\nI REACHED London in the last week of Lucilla's residence under her aunt's\nroof, and waited in town until it was time to take her back to Dimchurch.\n\nAs soon as it had become obviously too late for Oscar to risk the dreaded\nmeeting with Lucilla before strangers, his correspondence had, as a\nmatter of course, assumed a brighter tone. She was in high spirits once\nmore, poor thing, when we met--and full of delight at having me near her\nagain. We thoroughly enjoyed our few days in London--and took our fill of\nmusic at operas and concerts. I got on excellently well with the aunt\nuntil the last day, when something happened which betrayed me into an\navowal of my political convictions.\n\nThe old lady's consternation, when she discovered that I looked hopefully\nforward to a coming extermination of kings and priests, and a general\nre-distribution of property all over the civilized globe, is unutterable\nin words. On that occasion, I made one more aristocrat tremble. I also\nclosed Miss Batchford's door on me for the rest of my life. No matter!\nThe day is coming when the Batchford branch of humanity will not possess\na door to close. All Europe is drifting nearer and nearer to the\nPratolungo programme. Cheer up, my brothers without land, and my sisters\nwithout money in the Funds! We will have it out with the infamous rich\nyet. Long live the Republic!\n\nEarly in the month of April, Lucilla and I took leave of the Metropolis,\nand went back to Dimchurch.\n\nAs we drew nearer and nearer to the rectory, as Lucilla began to flush\nand fidget in eager anticipation of her re-union with Oscar, that\nuneasiness of mind which I had so readily dismissed while I was in Italy,\nbegan to find its way back to me again. My imagination now set to work at\ndrawing pictures--startling pictures of Oscar as a changed being, as a\nMedusa's head too terrible to be contemplated by mortal eyes. Where would\nhe meet us? At the entrance to the village? No. At the rectory gate? No.\nIn the quieter part of the garden which was at the back of the house?\nYes! There he stood waiting for us--alone!\n\nLucilla flew into his arms with a cry of delight. I stood behind and\nlooked at them.\n\nAh, how vividly I remember--at the moment when she embraced him--the\nfirst shock of seeing the two faces together! The drug had done its work.\nI saw her fair cheek laid innocently against the livid blackish blue of\n_his_ discolored skin. Heavens, how cruelly that first embrace marked the\ncontrast between what he had been when I left him, and what he had\nchanged to when I saw him now! His eyes turned from her face to mine, in\nsilent appeal to me while he held her in his arms. Their look told me the\nthought in him, as eloquently as if he had put it into words. \"You, who\nlove her, say--can we ever be cruel enough to tell her of _this?_\"\n\nI approached to take his hand. At the same moment, Lucilla suddenly drew\nback from him, laid her left hand on his shoulder, and passed her right\nhand rapidly over his face.\n\nFor an instant I felt my heart stand still. Her miraculous sensitiveness\nof touch had detected the dark color of my dress, on the day when we\nfirst met. Would it serve her, this time, as truly as it had served her\nthen?\n\nShe paused, after the first passage of her fingers over his face, with\nthe breathless attention to what she was about, which, in my own case, I\nremembered so well. A second time, she passed her hand over\nhim--considered again--and turned my way next.\n\n\"What does his face tell _you?_\" she asked. \"It tells _me_ that he has\nsomething on his mind. What is it?\"\n\nWe were safe--so far! The hateful medicine, in altering the color, had\nnot affected the texture, of his skin. As her touch had left it on her\ndeparture, so her touch found it again, on her return.\n\nBefore I could reply to Lucilla, Oscar answered for himself.\n\n\"Nothing is wrong, my darling,\" he said. \"My nerves are a little out of\norder to-day; and the joy of seeing you again has overcome me for the\nmoment--that is all.\"\n\nShe shook her head impatiently.\n\n\"No,\" she said, \"it's not all.\" She touched his heart. \"Why is it beating\nso fast?\" She took his hand in hers. \"Why has it turned so cold? I must\nknow. I _will_ know! Come indoors.\"\n\nAt that awkward moment, the most wearisome of living men suddenly proved\nhimself to be the most welcome of living men. The rector appeared in the\ngarden, to receive his daughter on her return. Enfolded in Reverend\nFinch's paternal embraces; harangued by Reverend Finch's prodigious\nvoice, Lucilla was effectually silenced--the subject was inevitably\nchanged. Oscar drew me aside out of hearing, while her attention was\ndiverted from him.\n\n\"I saw you,\" he said. \"_You_ were horrified at the first sight of me.\n_You_ were relieved when you found that her touch told her nothing. Help\nme to keep her from suspecting it, for two months more--and you will be\nthe best friend that ever man had.\"\n\n\"Two months?\" I repeated.\n\n\"Yes. If there is no return of the fits in two months, the doctor will\nconsider my recovery complete. Lucilla and I may be married at the end of\nthe time.\"\n\n\"My friend Oscar, are you contemplating a fraud on Lucilla?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Come! come! you know what I mean! Is it honorable first to entrap her\ninto marrying you--and then to confess to her the color of your face?\"\n\nHe sighed bitterly.\n\n\"I shall fill her with horror of me, if I confess it. Look at me! look at\nme!\" he said, lifting his ghastly hands in despair to his blue face.\n\nI was determined not to give way--even to that.\n\n\"Be a man!\" I said. \"Own it boldly. What is she going to marry you for?\nFor your face that she can never see? No! For your heart that is one with\nher own. Trust to her natural good sense--and, better than that, to the\ndevoted love that you have inspired in her. She will see her stupid\nprejudice in its true light, when she feels it trying to part her from\n_you._\"\n\n\"No! no! no! Remember her letter to her father. I shall lose her for\never, if I tell her now!\"\n\nI took his arm, and endeavored to lead him to Lucilla. She as already\ntrying to escape from her father; she was already longing to hear the\nsound of Oscar's voice again.\n\nHe obstinately shrank back. I began to feel angry with him. In another\nmoment, I should have said or done something that I might have repented\nof afterwards--if a new interruption had not happened before I could open\nmy lips.\n\nAnother person appeared in the garden--the man-servant from Browndown;\nwith a letter for his master in his hand.\n\n\"This has just come, sir,\" said the man, \"by the afternoon post. It is\nmarked 'Immediate.' I thought I had better bring it to you here.\"\n\nOscar took the letter, and looked at the address. \"My brother's writing!\"\nhe exclaimed. \"A letter from Nugent!\"\n\nHe opened the letter--and burst out with a cry of joy which brought\nLucilla instantly to his side.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked eagerly.\n\n\"Nugent is coming back! Nugent will be here in a week! Oh, Lucilla! my\nbrother is coming to stay with me at Browndown!\"\n\nHe caught her in his arms, and kissed her, in the first rapture of\nreceiving that welcome news. She forced herself away from him without\nanswering a word. She turned her poor blind face round and round, in the\nsearch for me.\n\n\"Here I am!\" I said.\n\nShe roughly and angrily put her arm in mine. I saw the jealous misery in\nher face as she dragged me away with here to the house. Never yet had\nOscar's voice, in _her_ experience of him, sounded the note of happiness\nthat she heard in it now! Never yet had she felt Oscar's heart on Oscar's\nlips, as she felt it when he kissed her in the first joy of anticipating\nNugent's return!\n\n\"Can he hear me?\" she whispered, when we had left the lawn, and she felt\nthe gravel under her feet.\n\n\"No. What is it?\"\n\n\"I hate his brother!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-SECOND\n\nThe Twin-Brother's Letter\n\nLITTLE thinking what a storm he had raised, poor innocent\nOscar--paternally escorted by the rector--followed us into the house,\nwith his open letter in his hand.\n\nJudging by certain signs visible in my reverend friend, I concluded that\nthe announcement of Nugent Dubourg's coming visit to Dimchurch--regarded\nby the rest of us as heralding the appearance of a twin-brother--was\nregarded by Mr. Finch as promising the arrival of a twin-fortune. Oscar\nand Nugent shared the comfortable paternal inheritance. Finch smelt\nmoney.\n\n\"Compose yourself,\" I whispered to Lucilla as the two gentlemen followed\nus into the sitting-room. \"Your jealousy of his brother is a childish\njealousy. There is room enough in his heart for his brother as well as\nfor you.\"\n\nShe only repeated obstinately, with a vicious pinch on my arm, \"I hate\nhis brother!\"\n\n\"Come and sit down by me,\" said Oscar, approaching her on the other side.\n\"I want to run over Nugent's letter. It's so interesting! There is a\nmessage in it to you.\" Too deeply absorbed in his subject to notice the\nsullen submission with which she listened to him, he placed her on a\nchair, and began reading. \"The first lines,\" he explained, \"relate to\nNugent's return to England, and to his delightful idea of coming to stay\nwith me at Browndown. Then he goes on: 'I found all your letters waiting\nfor me on my return to New York. Need I tell you, my dearest brother----'\"\n\nLucilla stopped him at those words by rising abruptly from her seat.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't like this chair!\"\n\nOscar got her another--an easy-chair this time--and returned to the\nletter.\n\n\"'Need I tell you, my dearest brother, how deeply you have interested me\nby the announcement of your contemplated marriage? Your happiness is my\nhappiness. I feel with you; I congratulate you; I long to see my future\nsister-in-law----'\"\n\nLucilla got up again. Oscar, in astonishment, asked what was wrong now?\n\n\"I am not comfortable at this end of the room.\"\n\nShe walked to the other end of the room. Patient Oscar walked after her,\nwith his precious letter in his hand. He offered her a third chair. She\npetulantly declined to take it, and selected another chair for herself.\nOscar returned to the letter:--\n\n\"'How melancholy, and yet how interesting it is, to hear that she is\nblind! My sketches of American scenery happened to be lying about in the\nroom when I read your letter. The first thought that came to me, on\nhearing of Miss Finch's affliction, was suggested by my sketches. I said\nto myself, \"Sad! sad! my sister-in-law will never see my Works.\" The true\nartist, Oscar, is always thinking of his Works. I shall bring back, let\nme tell you, some very remarkable studies for future pictures. They will\nnot be so numerous, perhaps, as you may expect. I prefer to trust to my\nintellectual perception of beauty, rather than to mere laborious\ntranscripts from Nature. In certain moods of mine (speaking as an artist)\nNature puts me out.'\" There Oscar paused, and appealed to me. \"What\nwriting!--eh? I always told you, Madame Pratolungo, that Nugent was a\ngenius. You see it now. Don't get up, Lucilla. I am going on. There is a\nmessage to you in this part of the letter. So neatly expressed!\"\n\nLucilla persisted in getting up; the announcement of the neatly-expressed\nmessage to be read next, produced no effect on her. She walked to the\nwindow, and trifled impatiently with the flowers placed in it. Oscar\nlooked in mild astonishment, first at me--then at the rector. Reverend\nFinch--listening thus far with the complimentary attention due to the\ncorrespondence of one young man of fortune with another young man of\nfortune--interfered in Oscar's interests, to secure him a patient\nhearing.\n\n\"My dear Lucilla, endeavor to control your restlessness. You interfere\nwith our enjoyment of this interesting letter. I could wish to see fewer\nchanges of place, my child, and a more undivided attention to what Oscar\nis reading to you.\"\n\n\"I am not interested in what he is reading to me.\" In the nervous\nirritation which produced this ungracious answer, she overthrew one of\nthe flower-pots. Oscar set it up again for her with undiminished\ngood-temper.\n\n\"Not interested!\" he exclaimed. \"Wait a little. You haven't heard\nNugent's message yet. Listen to this! 'Present my best and kindest\nregards to the future Mrs. Oscar' (dear fellow!); 'and say that she has\ngiven me a new interest in hastening my return to England.' There! Isn't\nthat prettily put? Come Lucilla! own that Nugent is worth listening to\nwhen he writes about _you!_\"\n\nShe turned towards him for the first time. The charm of the tone in which\nhe spoke those words subdued her, in spite of herself.\n\n\"I am much obliged to your brother,\" she answered gently, \"and very much\nashamed of myself for what I said just now.\" She stole her hand into his,\nand whispered, \"You are so fond of Nugent--I begin to be almost afraid\nthere will be no love left for me.\"\n\nOscar was enchanted. \"Wait till you see him, and you will be as fond of\nhim as I am,\" he said. \"Nugent is not like me. He fascinates people the\nmoment they come in contact with him. Nobody can resist Nugent.\"\n\nShe still held his hand, with a perplexed and saddened face. The\nadmirable absence of any jealousy on his side--his large and generous\nconfidence in _her_ love for _him_--was just the rebuke to her that she\ncould feel; just the rebuke also (in my opinion) that she had deserved.\n\n\"Go on, Oscar,\" said the rector, in his deepest notes of encouragement.\n\"What next, dear boy? what next?\"\n\n\"Another interesting bit, of quite a new kind,\" Oscar replied. \"There is\na little mystery to stir us up on the last page of the letter. Nugent\nsays:--'I have become acquainted (here, in New York) with a very\nremarkable man, a German who has made a great deal of money in the United\nStates. He proposes visiting England early in the present year; and he\nwill write and let me know when he has arrived. I shall feel particular\npleasure in presenting him to you and your future wife. It is quite\npossible that you may have special reason to congratulate yourselves on\nmaking his acquaintance. For the present, no more of my new friend until\nwe meet at Browndown.'--'Special reason to congratulate ourselves on\nmaking his acquaintance.'\" repeated Oscar, folding up the letter.\n\"Nugent never writes in that way without a reason for it. Who can the\nGerman gentleman be?\"\n\nMr. Finch suddenly lifted his head, and looked at Oscar with a certain\nappearance of alarm.\n\n\"Your brother mentions that he has made his fortune in America,\" said the\nReverend gentleman. \"I hope he is not connected with the money-market. He\nmight infect Mr. Nugent with the spirit of reckless speculation which is,\nso to speak, the national sin of the United States. Your brother, having\nno doubt the same generous disposition as yours----\"\n\n\"A far finer disposition than mine, Mr. Finch,\" interposed Oscar.\n\n\"Possessed, like you, of the gifts of fortune,\" proceeded the rector,\nwith mounting enthusiasm.\n\n\"Once possessed of them,\" said Oscar. \"Far from being overburdened with\nthe gifts of fortune, now!\"\n\n\"What!!!\" cried Mr. Finch, with a start of consternation.\n\n\"Nugent has run through his fortune,\" proceeded Oscar, quite composedly.\n\"I lent him the money to go to America. My brother is a genius, Mr.\nFinch. When did you ever hear of a genius who could keep within limits?\nNugent is not content to live in my humble way. He has the tastes of a\nprince--money is nothing to him. It doesn't matter. He will make a new\nfortune Out of his pictures; and, in the meantime, you know, I can always\nlend him something to go on with.\"\n\nMr. Finch rose from his seat, with the air of a man whose just\nanticipations have not been realized--whose innocent confidence has been\nscandalously betrayed. Here was a prospect! Another person in perpetual\nwant of money, going to settle under the shadow of the rectory! Another\nman likely to borrow of Oscar--and that man his brother!\n\n\"I fail to take your light view of your brother's extravagance,\" said the\nrector, addressing Oscar with his loftiest severity of manner, at the\ndoor. \"I deplore and reprehend Mr. Nugent's misuse of the bounty bestowed\non him by an all-wise Providence. You will do well to consider, before\nyou encourage your brother's extravagance by lending him money. What does\nthe great poet of humanity say of lenders? The Bard of Avon tells us,\nthat 'loan oft loses both itself and friend.' Lay that noble line to\nheart, Oscar! Lucilla, be on your guard against that restlessness which I\nhave already had occasion to reprove. I find I must leave you, Madame\nPratolungo. I had forgotten my parish duties. My parish duties are\nwaiting for me. Good day! good day!\"\n\nHe looked round on us all three, in turn, with a very sour face, and\nwalked out. \"Surely,\" I thought to myself, \"this brother of Oscar's is\nnot beginning well! First, the daughter takes offense at him, and now the\nfather follows her example. Even on the other side of the Atlantic, Mr.\nNugent Dubourg exercises a malignant influence, and disturbs the family\ntranquillity before he has shown his nose in the house!\"\n\n\n\nNothing more that is worth recording happened on that day. We had a very\ndull evening. Lucilla was out of spirits. As for me, I had not yet had\ntime to accustom myself to the shocking spectacle of Oscar's discolored\nface. I was serious and silent. You would never have guessed me to be a\nFrenchwoman, if you had seen me for the first time on the occasion of my\nreturn to the rectory.\n\nThe next day a small domestic event happened, which must be chronicled in\nthis place.\n\nOur Dimchurch doctor, always dissatisfied with his position in an obscure\ncountry place, had obtained an appointment in India which offered great\nprofessional advantages to an ambitious man. He called to take leave of\nus on his departure. I found an opportunity of speaking to him about\nOscar. He entirely agreed with me that the attempt to keep the change\nproduced in his former patient by the Nitrate of Silver from Lucilla's\nknowledge, was simply absurd. The truth would reach her, he said, before\nmany days were over our heads. With that prediction, addressed to my\nprivate ear, he left us. The removal of him from the scene was, you will\nplease to bear in mind, the removal of an important local witness to the\nmedical treatment of Oscar, and was, as such, an incident with a bearing\nof its own on the future, which claims a place for it in the present\nnarrative.\n\nTwo more days passed, and nothing happened. On the morning of the third\nday, the doctor's prophecy was all but fulfilled, through the medium of\nthe wandering Arab of the family, our funny little Jicks.\n\nWhile Lucilla and I were strolling about the garden with Oscar, the child\nsuddenly darted out on us from behind a tree, and, seizing Oscar round\nthe legs, hailed him affectionately at the top of her voice as \"The Blue\nMan!\" Lucilla instantly stopped, and said, \"Who do you call 'The Blue\nMan'?\" Jicks answered boldly, \"Oscar.\" Lucilla caught the child up in her\narms. \"Why do you call Oscar 'The Blue Man'?\" she asked. Jicks pointed to\nOscar's face, and then, remembering Lucilla's blindness, appealed to me.\n\"You tell her!\" said Jicks, in high glee. Oscar seized my hand, and\nlooked at me imploringly. I determined not to interfere. It was bad\nenough to remain passive, and to let her be kept in the dark. Actively, I\nwas resolved to take no part in deceiving her. Her color rose; she put\nJicks down on the ground. \"Are you both dumb?\" she asked. \"Oscar! I\ninsist on knowing it--how have you got the nick-name of 'The Blue Man'?\"\nLeft helpless, Oscar (to my disgust) took refuge in a lie--and, worse\nstill, a clumsy lie. He declared that he had got his nick-name in the\nnursery, at the time of Lucilla's absence in London, by one day painting\nhis face in the character of Bluebeard to amuse the children! If Lucilla\nhad felt the faintest suspicion of the truth, blind as she was, she must\nnow have discovered it. As things were, Oscar annoyed and irritated her.\nI could see that it cost her a struggle to suppress something like a\nfeeling of contempt for him. \"Amuse the children, the next time, in some\nother way,\" she said. \"Though I can't see you, still I don't like to hear\nof your disfiguring your face by painting it blue.\" With that answer, she\nwalked away a little by herself, evidently disappointed in her betrothed\nhusband for the first time in her experience of him.\n\nHe cast another imploring look at me. \"Did you hear what she said about\nmy face?\" he whispered.\n\n\"You have lost an excellent opportunity of speaking out,\" I answered. \"I\nbelieve you will bitterly regret the folly and the cruelty of deceiving\nher.\"\n\nHe shook his head, with the immovable obstinacy of a weak man.\n\n\"Nugent doesn't think as you do,\" he said, handing me the letter. \"Read\nthat bit there--now Lucilla is out of hearing.\"\n\nI paused for a moment before I could read. The resemblance between the\ntwins extended even to their handwritings! If I had picked Nugent's\nletter up, I should have handed it to Oscar as a letter of Oscar's own\nwriting.\n\nThe paragraph to which he pointed, only contained these lines:--\"Your\nlast relieves my anxiety about your health. I entirely agree with you\nthat any personal sacrifice which cures you of those horrible attacks is\na sacrifice wisely made. As to your keeping the change a secret from the\nyoung lady, I can only say that I suppose you know best how to act in\nthis emergency. I will abstain from forming any opinion of my own until\nwe meet.\"\n\nI handed Oscar back the letter.\n\n\"There is no very warm approval there of the course you are taking,\" I\nsaid. \"The only difference between your brother and me is, that he\nsuspends his opinion, and that I express mine.\"\n\n\"I have no fear of my brother,\" Oscar answered. \"Nugent will feel for me,\nand understand me, when he comes to Browndown. In the meantime, this\nshall not happen again.\"\n\nHe stooped over Jicks. The child, while we were talking, had laid herself\ndown luxuriously on the grass, and was singing to herself little snatches\nof a nursery song. Oscar pulled her up on her legs rather roughly. He was\nout of temper with her, as well as with himself.\n\n\"What are you going to do?\" I asked.\n\n\"I am going to see Mr. Finch,\" he answered, \"and to have Jicks kept for\nthe future out of Lucilla's garden.\"\n\n\"Does Mr. Finch approve of your silence?\"\n\n\"Mr. Finch, Madame Pratolungo, leaves me to decide on a matter which\nconcerns nobody but Lucilla and myself.\"\n\nAfter that reply, there was an end of all further remonstrance from me,\nas a matter of course.\n\nOscar walked off with his prisoner to the house. Jicks trotted along by\nhis side, unconscious of the mischief she had done, singing another verse\nof the nursery song. I rejoined Lucilla, with my mind made up as to the\nline of conduct I should adopt in the future. If Oscar did succeed in\nkeeping the truth concealed from her, I was positively resolved, come\nwhat might of it, to enlighten her before they were married, with my own\nlips. What! after pledging myself to keep the secret? Yes. Perish the\npromise which makes me false to a person whom I love! I despise such\npromises from the bottom of my heart.\n\nTwo days more slipped by--and then a telegram found its way to Browndown.\nOscar came running to us, at the rectory, with his news. Nugent had\nlanded at Liverpool. Oscar was to expect him at Dimchurch on the next\nday.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-THIRD\n\nHe sets us All Right\n\nI HAVE thus far quite inadvertently omitted to mention one of the\nprominent virtues of Reverend Finch. He was an accomplished master of\nthat particular form of human persecution which is called reading aloud;\nand he inflicted his accomplishment on his family circle at every\navailable opportunity. Of what we suffered on these occasions, I shall\nsay nothing. Let it be enough to mention that the rector thoroughly\nenjoyed the pleasure of hearing his own magnificent voice.\n\nThere was no escaping Mr. Finch when the rage for \"reading\" seized on\nhim. Now on one pretense, and now on another, he descended on us\nunfortunate women, book in hand; seated us at one end of the room; placed\nhimself at the other; opened his dreadful mouth; and fired words at us,\nlike shots at a target, by the hour together. Sometimes he gave us\npoetical readings from Shakespeare or Milton; and sometimes Parliamentary\nspeeches by Burke or Sheridan. Read what he might, he made such a noise\nand such a fuss over it; he put his own individuality so prominently in\nthe foremost place, and he kept the poets or the orators whom he was\nsupposed to be interpreting so far in the back ground, that they lost\nevery trace of character of their own, and became one and all perfectly\nintolerable reflections of Mr. Finch. I date my first unhappy doubts of\nthe supreme excellence of Shakespeare's poetry from the rector's\nreadings; and I attribute to the same exasperating cause my implacable\nhostility (on every question of the time) to the policy of Mr. Burke. On\nthe evening when Nugent Dubourg was expected at Browndown--and when we\nparticularly wanted to be left alone to dress ourselves, and to gossip by\nanticipation about the expected visitor--Mr. Finch was seized with one of\nhis periodical rages for firing off words at his family, after tea. He\nselected _Hamlet_ as the medium for exhibiting his voice, on this\noccasion; and he declared, as the principal motive for taking his\nelocutionary exercise, that the object he especially had in view was the\nbenefit of poor Me!\n\n\"My good creature, I accidentally heard you reading to Lucilla, the other\nday. It was very nice, as far as it went--very nice indeed. But you will\nallow me--as a person, Madame Pratolungo, possessing considerable\npractice in the art of reading aloud--to observe that you might be\nbenefited by a hint or two. I will give you a few ideas. (Mrs. Finch! I\npropose giving Madame Pratolungo a few ideas.) Pay particular attention,\nif you please, to the Pauses, and to the management of the Voice at the\nend of the lines. Lucilla, my child, you are interested in this. The\nperfecting of Madame Pratolungo is a matter of considerable importance to\n_you._ Don't go away.\"\n\nLucilla and I happened, on that evening, to be guests at the rectory\ntable. It was one of the regular occasions on which we left our own side\nof the house, and joined the family at (what Mr. Finch called) \"the\npastor's evening meal.\" He had got his wife; he had got his eldest\ndaughter; he had got your humble servant. A horrid smile of enjoyment\noverspread the reverend gentleman's face, as he surveyed us from the\nopposite end of the room, and opened his vocal fire on his audience of\nthree.\n\n\"_Hamlet:_ Act the First; Scene the First. Elsinore. A Platform before\nthe Castle. Francisco on his post\" (Mr. Finch). \"Enter to him Bernardo\"\n(Mr. Finch). \"Who's there?\" \"Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.\"\n(Mrs. Finch unfolds herself--she suckles the baby, and tries to look as\nif she was having an intellectual treat.) \"Francisco and Bernardo\nconverse in bass--Boom-boom-boom. Enter Horatio and Marcellus\" (Mr. Finch\nand Mr. Finch.) \"Stand! Who's there?\" \"Friends to this ground.\" \"And\nliegemen to the Dane.\" (Madame Pratolungo begins to feel the elocutionary\nexposition of Shakespeare, where she always feels it, in her legs. She\ntries to sit still on her chair. Useless! She is suffering under the\nmalady known to her by bitter experience of Mr. Finch, as the\nHamlet-Fidgets.) Bernardo and Franciso, Horatio and Marcellus,\nconverse--Boom-boom-boom. \"Enter Ghost of Hamlet's Father.\" Mr. Finch\nmakes an awful pause. In the supernatural silence, we can hear the baby\nsucking. Mrs. Finch enjoys her intellectual treat. Madame Pratolungo\nfidgets. Lucilla catches the infection, and fidgets too. Marcellus-Finch\ngoes on. \"Thou art a scholar, speak to it, Horatio.\" Bernardo-Finch backs\nhim: \"Looks it not like the King? Mark it, Horatio.\" Lucilla-Finch\ninserts herself in the dialogue: \"Papa, I am very sorry; I have had a\nnervous headache all day; please excuse me if I take a turn in the\ngarden.\" The rector makes another awful pause, and glares at his\ndaughter. (Exit Lucilla.) Horatio looks at the Ghost, and takes up the\ndialogue: \"Most like; it harrows me \"--Boom-boom-boom. The baby is\nsatiated. Mrs. Finch wants her handkerchief. Madame Pratolungo seizes the\nopportunity of moving her distracted legs, and finds the handkerchief.\nMr. Finch pauses--glares---goes on again--reaches the second scene.\n\"Enter the King, Queen, Hamlet, Polonius, Laertes, Voltimand, Cornelius,\nand Lords Attendant.\" All Mr. Finch! oh, my legs! my legs! all Mr. Finch,\nand Boom-boom-boom. Third scene. \"Enter Laertes and Ophelia.\" (Both\nRectors of Dimchurch; both with deep bass voices; both about five feet\nhigh, pitted with the small-pox, and adorned round the neck with dingy\nwhite cravats.) Mr. Finch goes on and on and on. Mrs. Finch and the baby\nsimultaneously close their eyes in slumber. Madame Pratolungo suffers\nsuch tortures of restlessness in her lower limbs, that she longs for a\nskilled surgeon to take out his knife and deliver her from her own legs.\nMr. Finch advances in deeper and deeper bass, in keener and keener\nenjoyment, to the Fourth Scene. (\"Enter Hamlet, Horatio, and Marcellus.\")\nMercy! what do I hear? Is relief approaching to us from the world\noutside? Are there footsteps in the hall? Yes! Mrs. Finch opens her eyes;\nMrs. Finch hears the footsteps, and rejoices in them as I do. Reverend\nHamlet hears nothing but his own voice. He begins the scene: \"The air\nbites shrewdly. It is very cold.\" The door opens. The rector feels a gust\nof air, dramatically appropriate, just at the right moment. He looks\nround. If it is a servant, let that domestic person tremble! No--not a\nservant. Guests--heavens be praised, guests. Welcome, gentlemen--welcome!\nNo more Hamlet, tonight, thanks to You. Enter two Characters who must be\ninstantly attended to:--Mr. Oscar Dubourg; introducing his twin-brother\nfrom America, Mr. Nugent Dubourg.\n\n\n\nAstonishment at the extraordinary resemblance between them, was the one\nimpression felt by all three of us, as the brothers entered the room.\n\nExactly alike in their height, in their walk, in their features, and in\ntheir voices. Both with the same colored hair and the same beardless\nfaces. Oscar's smile exactly reflected on Nugent's lips. Oscar's odd\nlittle semi-foreign tricks of gesticulation with his hands, exactly\nreproduced in the hands of Nugent. And, to crown it all, there was the\ncomplexion which Oscar had lost for ever (just a shade darker perhaps)\nfound again on Nugent's cheeks! The one difference which made it possible\nto distinguish between them, at the moment when they first appeared\ntogether in the room, was also the one difference which Lucilla was\nphysically incapable of detecting--the terrible contrast of color between\nthe brother who bore the blue disfigurement of the drug, and the brother\nwho was left as Nature had made him.\n\n\"Delighted to make your acquaintance, Mrs. Finch--I have long wished for\nthis pleasure. Thank you, Mr. Finch, for all your kindness to my brother.\nMadame Pratolungo, I presume? Permit me to shake hands. It is needless to\nsay, I have heard of your illustrious husband. Aha! here's a baby. Yours,\nMrs. Finch? Girl or boy, ma'am? A fine child--if a bachelor may be\nallowed to pronounce an opinion. _Tweet--tweet--tweet!_\"\n\nHe chirruped to the baby, as if he had been a family man, and snapped his\nfingers gaily. Poor Oscar's blue face turned in silent triumph towards\nme. \"What did I tell you?\" his look asked. \"Did I not say Nugent\nfascinated everybody at first sight?\" Most true. An irresistible man. So\nutterly different in his manner from Oscar--except when he was in\nrepose--and yet so like Oscar in other respects, I can only describe him\nas his brother completed. He had the pleasant lively flow of spirits, the\neasy winning gentleman-like confidence in himself, which Oscar wanted.\nAnd, then, what excellent taste he possessed. He liked children! he\nrespected the memory of my glorious Pratolungo!--In half a minute from\nthe time when he entered the room, Nugent Dubourg had won Mrs. Finch's\nheart and mine.\n\nHe turned from the baby to Mr. Finch, and pointed to the open Shakespeare\non the table.\n\n\"You were reading to the ladies?\" he said. \"I am afraid we have\ninterrupted you.\"\n\n\n\"Don't mention it,\" said the rector, with his lofty politeness. \"Another\ntime will do. It is a habit of mine, Mr. Nugent, to read aloud in my\nfamily circle. As a clergyman and a lover of poetry (in both capacities)\nI have long cultivated the art of elocution----\"\n\n\"My dear sir, excuse me, you have cultivated it all wrong!\"\n\nMr. Finch paused, thunderstruck. A man in his presence presuming to have\nan opinion of his own! a man in the rectory parlor capable of\ninterrupting the rector in the middle of a sentence! guilty of the insane\naudacity of telling him, as a reader--with Shakespeare open before\nthem--that he read wrong!\n\n\"Oh, we heard you as we came in!\" proceeded Nugent, with the most\nundiminished confidence, expressed in the most gentlemanlike manner. \"You\nread it like this.\" He took up _Hamlet_ and read the opening line of the\nFourth Scene, (\"The air bites shrewdly. It is very cold\") with an\nirresistibly-accurate imitation of Mr. Finch. \"That's nor the way Hamlet\nwould speak. No man in his position would remark that it was very cold in\nthat bow-wow manner. What is Shakespeare before all things? True to\nnature; always true to nature. What condition is Hamlet in when he is\nexpecting to see the Ghost? He is nervous, and he feels the cold. Let him\nshow it naturally; let him speak as any other man would speak, under the\ncircumstances. Look here! Quick and quiet--like this. 'The air bites\nshrewdly'--there Hamlet stops and shivers--pur-rer-rer! 'it is very\ncold.' That's the way to read Shakespeare!\"\n\nMr. Finch lifted his head into the air as high as it could possibly go,\nand brought the flat of his hand down with a solemn and sounding smack on\nthe open book.\n\n\"Allow me to say, sir----!\" he began.\n\nNugent stopped him again, more good-humouredly than ever.\n\n\"You don't agree with me? All right! Quite useless to dispute about it. I\ndon't know what you may be--I am the most opinionated man in existence.\nSheer waste of time, my dear sir, to attempt convincing Me. Now, just\nlook at that child!\" Here Mr. Nugent Dubourg's attention was suddenly\nattracted by the baby. He twisted round on his heel, and addressed Mrs.\nFinch. \"I take the liberty of saying, ma'am, that a more senseless dress\ndoesn't exist, than the dress that is put, in this country, on infants of\ntender years. What are the three main functions which that child--that\ncharming child of yours-performs? He sucks; he sleeps; and he grows. At\nthe present moment, he isn't sucking, he isn't sleeping--he is growing\nwith all his might. Under those interesting circumstances, what does he\nwant to do? To move his limbs freely in every direction. You let him\nswing his arms to his heart's content--and you deny him freedom to kick\nhis legs. You clothe him in a dress three times as long as himself. He\ntries to throw his legs up in the air as he throws his arms, and he can't\ndo it. There is his senseless long dress entangling itself in his toes,\nand making an effort of what Nature intended to be a luxury. Can anything\nbe more absurd? What are mothers about? Why don't they think for\nthemselves? Take my advice--short petticoats, Mrs. Finch. Liberty,\nglorious liberty, for my young friend's legs! Room, heaps of room, for\nthat infant martyr's toes!\"\n\nMrs. Finch listened helplessly--lifted the baby's long petticoats, and\nlooked at them--stared piteously at Nugent Dubourg--opened her lips to\nspeak--and, thinking better of it, turned her watery eyes on her husband,\nappealing to _him_ to take the matter up. Mr. Finch made another attempt\nto assert his dignity--a ponderously satirical attempt, this time.\n\n\"In offering your advice to my wife, Mr. Nugent,\" said the rector, \"you\nmust permit me to remark that it would have had more practical force if\nit had been the advice of a married man. I beg to remind you----\"\n\n\"You beg to remind me that it is the advice of a bachelor? Oh, come! that\nreally won't do at this time of day. Doctor Johnson settled that argument\nat once and for ever, a century since. 'Sir!' (he said to somebody of\nyour way of thinking) 'you may scold your carpenter, when he has made a\nbad table, though you can't make a table yourself.' I say to you--'Mr.\nFinch, you may point out a defect in a baby's petticoats, though you\nhaven't got a baby yourself!' Doesn't that satisfy you? All right! Take\nanother illustration. Look at your room here. I can see in the twinkling\nof an eye, that it's badly lit. You have only got one window--you ought\nto have two. Is it necessary to be a practical builder to discover that?\nAbsurd! Are you satisfied now? No! Take another illustration. What's this\nprinted paper, here, on the chimney-piece? Assessed Taxes. Ha! Assessed\nTaxes will do. You're not in the House of Commons; you're not Chancellor\nof the Exchequer--but haven't you an opinion of your own about taxation,\nin spite of that? Must you and I be in Parliament before we can presume\nto see that the feeble old British Constitution is at its last gasp----?\"\n\n\"And the vigorous young Republic drawing its first breath of life!\" I\nburst in; introducing the Pratolungo programme (as my way is) at every\navailable opportunity.\n\nNugent Dubourg instantly wheeled round in my direction; and set me right\non my subject, just as he had set the rector right on reading _Hamlet,_\nand Mrs. Finch right on clothing babies.\n\n\"Not a bit of it!\" he pronounced positively. \"The 'young Republic' is the\nricketty child of the political family. Give him up, ma'am. You will\nnever make a man of him.\"\n\nI tried to assert myself as the rector had tried before me--with\nprecisely the same result. I appealed indignantly to the authority of my\nillustrious husband.\n\n\"Doctor Pratolungo--\" I began.\n\n\"Was an honest man,\" interposed Nugent Dubourg. \"I am an advanced Liberal\nmyself--I respect him. But he was quite wrong. All sincere republicans\nmake the same mistake. They believe in the existence of public spirit in\nEurope. Amiable delusion! Public spirit is dead in Europe. Public spirit\nis the generous emotion of young nations, of new peoples. In selfish old\nEurope, private interest has taken its place. When your husband preached\nthe republic, on what ground did he put it? On the ground that the\nrepublic was going to elevate the nation. Pooh! Ask me to accept the\nrepublic, on the ground that I elevate Myself--and, supposing you can\nprove it, I will listen to you. If you are ever to set republican\ninstitutions going, in the Old World--_there_ is the only motive power\nthat will do it!\"\n\nI was indignant at such sentiments. \"My glorious husband--\" I began\nagain.\n\n\"Would have died rather than appeal to the meanest instincts of his\nfellow-creatures. Just so! There was his mistake. That's why he never\ncould make anything of the republic. That's why the republic is the\nricketty child of the political family. _Quod erat demonstrandum,_\" said\nNugent Dubourg, finishing me off with a pleasant smile, and an easy\nindicative gesture of the hand which said, \"Now I have settled these\nthree people in succession, I am equally well satisfied with myself and\nwith them!\"\n\nHis smile was irresistible. Bent as I was on disputing the degrading\nconclusions at which he had arrived, I really had not fire enough in me,\nat the moment, to feed my own indignation. As to Reverend Finch, he sat\nsilently swelling in a corner; digesting, as he best might, the discovery\nthat there was another man in the world, besides the Rector of Dimchurch,\nwith an excellent opinion of himself, and with perfectly unassailable\nconfidence and fluency in expressing it. In the momentary silence that\nnow followed, Oscar got his first opportunity of speaking. He had, thus\nfar, been quite content to admire his clever brother. He now advanced to\nme, and asked what had become of Lucilla.\n\n\"The servant told me she was here,\" he said. \"I am so anxious to\nintroduce her to Nugent.\"\n\nNugent put his arm affectionately round his brother's neck, and gave him\na hug. \"Dear old boy! I am just as anxious as you are.\"\n\n\"Lucilla went out a little while since,\" I said, \"to take a turn in the\ngarden.\"\n\n\"I'll go and find her,\" said Oscar. \"Wait here, Nugent. I'll bring her\nin.\"\n\nHe left the room. Before he could close the door one of the servants\nappeared, to claim Mrs. Finch's private ear, on some mysterious domestic\nemergency. Nugent facetiously entreated her, as she passed him, to clear\nher mind of prejudice, and consider the question of infant petticoats on\nits own merits. Mr. Finch took offense at this second reference to the\nsubject. He rose to follow his wife.\n\n\"When you are a married man, Mr. Dubourg,\" said the rector severely, \"you\nwill learn to leave the management of an infant in its mother's hands.\"\n\n\"There's another mistake!\" remarked Nugent, following him with unabated\ngood humour, to the door. \"A married man's idea of another man as a\nhusband, always begins and ends with his idea of himself.\" He turned to\nme, as the door closed on Mr. Finch. \"Now we are alone, Madame\nPratolungo,\" he said, \"I want to speak to you about Miss Finch. There is\nan opportunity, before she comes in. Oscar's letter only told me that she\nwas blind. I am naturally interested in everything that relates to my\nbrother's future wife. I am particularly interested about this affliction\nof hers. May I ask how long she has been blind?\"\n\n\"Since she was a year old,\" I replied.\n\n\"Through an accident?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"After a fever? or a disease of any other sort?\"\n\nI began to feel a little surprised at his entering into these medical\ndetails.\n\n\"I never heard that it was through a fever, or other illness,\" I said.\n\"So far as I know, the blindness came on unexpectedly, from some cause\nthat did not express itself to the people about her, at the time.\"\n\nHe drew his chair confidentially nearer to mine. \"How old is she?\" he\nasked.\n\nI began to feel more than a little surprised; and I showed it, I suppose,\non telling him Lucilla's age.\n\n\"As things are now,\" he explained, \"there are reasons which make me\nhesitate to enter on the question of Miss Finch's blindness either with\nmy brother, or with any members of the family. I must wait to speak about\nit to _them,_ until I can speak to good practical purpose. There is no\nharm in my starting the subject with _you._ When she first lost her\nsight, no means of restoring it were left untried, of course?\"\n\n\"I should suppose not,\" I replied. \"It's so long since, I have never\nasked.\"\n\n\"So long since,\" he repeated--and then considered for a moment.\n\nHis reflections ended in a last question.\n\n\"She is resigned, I suppose--and everybody about her is resigned--to the\nidea of her being hopelessly blind for life.\"\n\nInstead of answering him, I put a question on my side. My heart was\nbeginning to beat rapidly--without my knowing why.\n\n\"Mr. Nugent Dubourg,\" I said, \"what have you got in your mind about\nLucilla?\"\n\n\"Madame Pratolungo,\" he replied, \"I have got something in my mind which\nwas put into it by a friend of mine whom I met in America.\"\n\n\"The friend you mentioned in your letter to your brother?\"\n\n\"The same.\"\n\n\"The German gentleman whom you propose to introduce to Oscar and\nLucilla?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"May I ask who he is?\"\n\nNugent Dubourg looked at me attentively; considered with himself for the\nsecond time; and answered in these words:\n\n\"He is the greatest living authority, and the greatest living operator,\nin diseases of the eye.\"\n\nThe idea in his mind burst its way into my mind in a moment.\n\n\"Gracious God!\" I exclaimed, \"are you mad enough to suppose that\nLucilla's sight can be restored, after a blindness of one-and-twenty\nyears?\"\n\nHe suddenly held up his hand, in sign to me to be silent.\n\nAt the same moment the door opened; and Lucilla (followed by Oscar)\nentered the room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-FOURTH\n\nHe sees Lucilla\n\nTHE first impression which poor Miss Finch produced on Nugent Dubourg,\nwas precisely the same as the first impression which she had produced on\nme.\n\n\"Good Heavens!\" he cried. \"The Dresden Madonna! The Virgin of San Sisto!\"\n\nLucilla had already heard from me of her extraordinary resemblance to the\nchief figure in Raphael's renowned picture. Nugent's blunt outburst of\nrecognition passed unnoticed by her. She stopped short, in the middle of\nthe room--startled, the instant he spoke, by the extraordinary similarity\nof his tone and accent to the tone and accent of his brother's voice.\n\n\"Oscar,\" she asked nervously, \"are you behind me? or in front of me?\"\nOscar laughed, and answered \"Here!\"--speaking behind her. She turned her\nhead towards the place in front of her, from which Nugent had spoken.\n\"Your voice is wonderfully like Oscar's,\" she said, addressing him\ntimidly. \"Is your face exactly like his face, too? May I judge for myself\nof the likeness between you? I can only do it in one way--by my touch.\"\n\nOscar advanced, and placed a chair for his brother by Lucilla's side.\n\n\"She has eyes in the tips of her fingers,\" he said. \"Sit down, Nugent,\nand let her pass her hand over your face.\"\n\nNugent obeyed him in silence. Now that the first impression of surprise\nhad passed away, I observed that a marked change was beginning to assert\nitself in his manner.\n\nLittle by little, an unnatural constraint got possession of him. His\nfluent tongue found nothing to talk about. His easy movements altered in\nthe strangest way, until they almost became the movements of a slow\nawkward man. He was more like his brother than ever, as he sat down in\nthe chair to submit himself to Lucilla's investigation. She had produced,\nat first sight--as well as I could judge--some impression on him for\nwhich he had not been prepared; causing some mental disturbance in him\nwhich he was for the moment quite unable to control. His eyes looked up\nat her, spell-bound; his color came and went; his breath quickened\naudibly when her fingers touched his face.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" said Oscar, looking at him in surprise.\n\n\"Nothing is the matter,\" he answered, in the low absent tone of a man\nwhose mind was secretly pursuing its own train of thought.\n\nOscar said no more. Once, twice, three times, Lucilla's hand passed\nslowly over Nugent's face. He submitted to it, silently, gravely,\nimmovably--a perfect contrast to the talkative, lively young man of half\nan hour since. Lucilla employed a much longer time in examining him than\nshe had occupied in examining me.\n\nWhile the investigation was proceeding, I had leisure to think again over\nwhat had passed between Nugent and me on the subject of Lucilla's\nblindness, before she entered the room. My mind had by this time\nrecovered its balance. I was able to ask myself what this young fellow's\ndaring idea was really worth. Was it within the range of possibility that\na sense so delicate as the sense of sight, lost for one-and-twenty years,\ncould be restored by any means short of a miracle? It was monstrous to\nsuppose it: the thing could not be. If there had been the faintest chance\nof giving my poor dear back the blessing of sight, that chance would have\nbeen tried by competent persons years and years since. I was ashamed of\nmyself for having been violently excited at the moment by the new thought\nwhich Nugent had started in my mind; I was honestly indignant at his\nuselessly disturbing me with the vainest of all vain hopes. The one wise\nthing to do in the future, was to caution this flighty and inconsequent\nyoung man to keep his mad notion about Lucilla to himself--and to dismiss\nit from my own thoughts, at once and for ever.\n\nJust as I arrived at that sensible resolution, I was recalled to what was\ngoing on in the room, by Lucilla's voice, addressing me by my name.\n\n\"The likeness is wonderful,\" she said. \"Still, I think I can find a\ndifference between them.\"\n\n(The only difference between them was in the contrast of complexion and\nin the contrast of manner--both these being dissimilarities which\nappealed more or less directly to the eye.)\n\n\"What difference do you find?\" I asked.\n\nShe slowly came towards me, with an anxious perplexed face; pondering as\nshe advanced.\n\n\"I can't explain it,\" she answered--after a long silence.\n\nWhen Lucilla left him, Nugent rose from his chair. He abruptly--almost\nroughly--took his brother's hand. He spoke to his brother in a strangely\nexcited, feverish, headlong way.\n\n\"My dear fellow, now I have seen her, I congratulate you more heartily\nthan ever. She is charming; she is unique. Oscar! I could almost envy\nyou, if you were anyone else!\"\n\nOscar was radiant with delight. His brother's opinion ranked above all\nhuman opinions in his estimation. Before he could say a word in return,\nNugent left him as abruptly as he had approached him; walking away by\nhimself to the window--and standing there, looking out.\n\nLucilla had not heard him. She was still pondering, with the same\nperplexed face. The likeness between the twins was apparently weighing on\nher mind--an unsolved problem that vexed and irritated it. Without\nanything said by me to lead to resuming the subject, she returned\nobstinately to the assertion that she had just made.\n\n\"I tell you again I am sensible of a difference between them,\" she\nrepeated--\"though you don't seem to believe me.\"\n\nI interpreted this uneasy reiteration as meaning that she was rather\ntrying to convince herself than to convince me. In her blind condition,\nit was doubly and trebly embarrassing not to know one brother from the\nother. I understood her unwillingness to acknowledge this--I felt (in her\nposition) how it would have irritated me. She was waiting--impatiently\nwaiting--for me to say something on my side. I am, as you know already,\nan indiscreet woman. I innocently said one of my rash things.\n\n\"I believe whatever you tell me, my dear,\" I answered. \"You can find out\na difference between them, I have no doubt. Still, I own I should like to\nsee it put to the proof.\"\n\nHer color rose. \"How?\" she asked abruptly.\n\n\"Try your touch alternately on both their faces,\" I suggested, \"without\nknowing beforehand which position they each of them occupy. Make three\ntrials--leaving them to change their places or not, between each trial,\njust as they please. If you guess which is which correctly three times\nfollowing, there will be the proof that you can really lay your hand on a\ndifference between them.\"\n\nLucilla shrank from accepting the challenge. She drew back a step, and\nsilently shook her head. Nugent, who had overheard me, turned round\nsuddenly from the window, and supported my proposal.\n\n\"A capital notion!\" he burst out. \"Let's try it! You don't object,\nOscar--do you?\"\n\n\"_I_ object?\" cried Oscar--amazed at the bare idea of his opposing any\nassertion of his will to the assertion of his brother's will. \"If Lucilla\nis willing, I say Yes, with all my heart.\"\n\nThe two brothers approached us, arm in arm. Lucilla, very reluctantly,\nallowed herself to be persuaded into trying the experiment. Two chairs,\nexactly alike, were placed in front of her. At a sign from Nugent, Oscar\nsilently took the chair on her right. By this arrangement, the hand which\nshe had used in touching Nugent's face, would be now the hand that she\nwould employ in touching Oscar's face. When they were both seated, I\nannounced that we were ready. Lucilla placed her hands on their faces,\nright and left, without the faintest idea in her mind of the positions\nwhich the two relatively occupied.\n\nAfter first touching them with both hands, and both together, she tried\nthem separately next, beginning with Oscar, and using her right hand\nonly. She left him for Nugent; again using her right hand--then came back\nto him again--then returned to Nugent--hesitated---decided--tapped Nugent\nlightly on the head.\n\n\"Oscar!\" she said.\n\nNugent burst out laughing. The laugh told her, before any of us could\nspeak, that she had made a mistake at the first attempt.\n\n\"Try again, Lucilla,\" said Oscar kindly.\n\n\"Never!\" she answered, angrily stepping back from both of them. \"One\nmystification is enough.\"\n\nNugent tried next to persuade her to renew the experiment. She checked\nhim sternly at the first word.\n\n\"Do you think if I won't do it for Oscar,\" she said, \"that I would do it\nfor you? You laughed at me. What was there to laugh at? Your brother's\nfeatures are your features; your brother's hair is your hair; your\nbrother's height is your height. What is there so very ridiculous--with\nsuch a resemblance as that--in a poor blind girl like me mistaking you\none for the other? I wish to preserve a good opinion of you, for Oscar's\nsake. Don't turn me into ridicule again--or I shall be forced to think\nthat your brother's good heart is not yours also!\"\n\nNugent and Oscar looked at each other, petrified by this sudden outbreak;\nNugent, of the two, being the most completely overwhelmed by it.\n\nI attempted to interfere and put things right. My easy philosophy and my\nvolatile French nature, failed to see any adequate cause for this\nvehement exhibition of resentment on Lucilla's part. Something in my\ntone, as I suppose, only added to her irritation. I, in my turn, was\nchecked sternly at the first word. \"You proposed it,\" she said; \"You are\nthe most to blame.\" I hastened to make my apologies (inwardly remarking\nthat the habit of raising a storm in a tea-cup is a growing habit with\nthe rising generation in England). Nugent followed me with more apologies\non his side. Oscar supported us with his superior influence. He took\nLucilla's hand--kissed it--and whispered something in her ear. The kiss\nand the whisper acted like a charm. She held out her hand to Nugent, she\nput her arm round my neck and embraced me, with all her own grace and\nsweetness. \"Forgive me,\" she said to us gently. \"I wish I could learn to\nbe patient. But, oh, Mr. Nugent, it is sometimes so hard to be blind!\" I\ncan repeat the words; but I can give no idea of the touching simplicity\nwith which they were spoken--of her innocently earnest anxiety to win her\npardon. She so affected Nugent that he too--after a look at Oscar which\nsaid, \"May I?\"--kissed the hand that she offered to him. As his lips\ntouched her, she started. The bright flush which always indicated the\nsudden rising of a thought in her mind, flew over her face. She\nunconsciously held Nugent's hand in her own, absorbed in the interest of\nrealizing the new thought. For a moment, she stood, still as a statue,\nconsulting with herself. The moment passed, she dropped Nugent's hand,\nand turned gaily to me.\n\n\"Will you think me very obstinate?\" she asked.\n\n\"Why, my love?\"\n\n\"I am not satisfied yet. I want to try again.\"\n\n\"No! no! At any rate not to-day.\"\n\n\"I want to try again,\" she repeated. \"Not in your way. In a way of my own\nthat has just come into my head.\" She turned to Oscar. \"Will you humour\nme in this?\" It is needless to set down Oscar's reply. She turned to\nNugent. \"Will you?\"\n\n\"Only say what you wish me to do!\" he answered.\n\n\"Go with your brother,\" she said, \"to the other end of the room. I know\nwhere you are each of you standing, at this end. Madame Pratolungo will\nlead me to the place, and will put me just within reach of both your\nhands. I want each of you in turn (arrange by a sign between yourselves\nwhich is to begin) to take my hand, and hold it for a moment, and then\ndrop it. I have an idea that I can distinguish between you, in that\nway--and I want very much to try it.\"\n\nThe brothers went silently to the other end of the room. I led Lucilla,\nafter them, to the place in which they stood. At my suggestion, Nugent\nwas the first to take her hand, as she had requested; to hold it for a\nmoment, and then to drop it.\n\n\"Nugent!\" she said, without the slightest hesitation.\n\n\"Quite right,\" I answered.\n\nShe laughed gaily. \"Go on! Puzzle me if you possibly can.\"\n\nThe brothers noiselessly changed places. Oscar took her hand, standing\nexactly where Nugent had stood.\n\n\"Oscar!\" she said.\n\n\"Right again,\" I told her.\n\nAt a sign from Nugent, Oscar took her hand for the second time. She\nrepeated his name. At a sign from me, the brothers noiselessly placed\nthemselves, one on either side of her--Oscar on the left; Nugent on the\nright. I gave them the signal; and they each took one of her hands at the\nsame moment. This time, she waited a little longer before she spoke. When\nshe did speak, she was right once more. She turned smiling, towards the\nleft side, pointed to him as he stood by her, and said, \"Oscar!\"\n\nWe were all three equally surprised. I examined Oscar's hand and Nugent's\nhand alternately. Except the fatal difference in the color, they were, to\nall intents and purposes, the same hands--the same size, the same shape,\nthe same texture of skin; no scar or mark on the hand of one to\ndistinguish it from the hand of the other. By what mysterious process of\ndivination had she succeeded in discovering which was which?\n\nShe was unwilling, or unable, to reply to that question plainly.\n\n\"Something in me answers to one of them and not to the other,\" she said.\n\n\"What is it?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don't know. It answers to Oscar. It doesn't answer to Nugent--that's\nall.\"\n\nShe stopped any further inquiries by proposing that we should finish the\nevening with some music, in her own sitting-room, on the other side of\nthe house. When we were seated together at the pianoforte--with the\ntwin-brothers established as our audience at the other end of the\nroom--she whispered in my ear:\n\n\"I'll tell _you!_\"\n\n\"Tell me what?\"\n\n\"How I know which is which when they both of them take my hand. When\nOscar takes it, a delicious tingle runs from his hand into mine, and\nsteals all over me. I can't describe it any better than that.\"\n\n\"I understand. And when Nugent takes your hand, what do you feel?\"\n\n\"Nothing!\"\n\n\"And that is how you found out the difference between them down-stairs?\"\n\n\"That is how I shall always find out the difference between them. If\nOscar's brother ever attempts to play tricks upon my blindness (he is\nquite capable of it--he laughed at my blindness!), that is how I shall\nfind him out. I told you before I saw him that I hated him. I hate him\nstill.\"\n\n\"My dear Lucilla!\"\n\n\"I hate him still!\"\n\nShe struck the first chords on the piano, with an obstinate frown on her\npretty brow. Our little evening concert began.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-FIFTH\n\nNugent puzzles Madame Pratolungo\n\nI WAS far from sharing Lucilla's opinion of Nugent Dubourg. His enormous\nself-confidence was, to my mind, too amusing to be in the least\noffensive. I liked the spirit and gaiety of the young fellow. He came\nmuch nearer than his brother did to my ideal of the dash and resolution\nwhich ought to distinguish a man on the right side of thirty. So far as\nmy experience of them went, Nugent was (in the popular English phrase)\ngood company--and Oscar was not. My nationality leads me to attach great\nimportance to social qualities. The higher virtues of a man only show\nthemselves occasionally on compulsion, His social qualities come\nfamiliarly in contact with us every day of our lives. I like to be\ncheerful: I am all for the social qualities.\n\nThere was one little obstacle in those early days, which set itself up\nbetween my sympathies and Nugent.\n\nI was thoroughly at a loss to understand the impression which Lucilla had\nproduced on him.\n\nThe same constraint which had, in such a marked manner, subdued him at\nhis first interview with her, still fettered him in the time when they\nbecame better acquainted with one another. He was never in high spirits\nin her presence. Mr. Finch could talk him down without difficulty, if Mr.\nFinch's daughter happened to be by. Even when he was vaporing about\nhimself, and telling us of the wonderful things he meant to do in\nPainting, Lucilla's appearance was enough to check him, if she happened\nto come into the room. On the first day when he showed me his American\nsketches (I define them, if you ask my private opinion, as false\npretenses of Art, by a dashing amateur)--on that day, he was in full\nflow; marching up and down the room, smacking his forehead, and\nannouncing himself quite gravely as \"the coming man\" in landscape\npainting.\n\n\"My mission, Madame Pratolungo, is to reconcile Humanity and Nature. I\npropose to show (on an immense scale) how Nature (in her grandest\naspects) can adapt herself to the spiritual wants of mankind. In your joy\nor your sorrow, Nature has subtle sympathies with you, if you only know\nwhere to look for them. My pictures--no! my poems in color--will show\nyou. Multiply my works, as they certainly will be multiplied, by means of\nprints--and what does Art become in my hands? A Priesthood! In what\naspect do I present myself to the public? As a mere landscape painter?\nNo! As Grand Consoler!\" In the midst of this rhapsody (how wonderfully he\nresembled Oscar in _his_ bursts of excitement while he was talking!)--in\nthe full torrent of his predictions of his own coming greatness, Lucilla\nquietly entered the room. The \"Grand Consoler\" shut up his portfolio;\ndropped Painting on the spot; asked for Music, and sat down, a model of\nconventional propriety, in a corner of the room. I inquired afterwards,\nwhy he had checked himself when she came in. \"Did I?\" he said. \"I don't\nknow why.\" The thing was really inexplicable. He honestly admired\nher--one had only to notice him when he was looking at her to see it. He\nhad not the faintest suspicion of her dislike for him--she carefully\nconcealed it for Oscar's sake. He felt genuine sympathy for her in her\naffliction--his mad idea that her sight might yet be restored, was the\nnatural offspring of a true feeling for her. He was not unfavorable to\nhis brother's marriage--on the contrary, he ruffled the rector's dignity\n(he was always giving offense to Mr. Finch) by suggesting that the\nmarriage might be hastened. I heard him say the words myself:--\"The\nchurch is close by. Why can't you put on your surplice and make Oscar\nhappy to-morrow, after breakfast?\" More even than this, he showed the\nmost vivid interest--like a woman's interest rather than a man's--in\nlearning how the love-affair between Oscar and Lucilla had begun. I\nreferred him, so far as Oscar was concerned, to his brother as the\nfountain-head of information. He did not decline to consult his brother.\nHe did not own to me that he felt any difficulty in doing so. He simply\ndropped Oscar in silence; and asked about Lucilla. How had it begun on\nher side? I reminded him of his brother's romantic position at Dimchurch\nand told him to judge for himself of the effect it would produce on the\nexcitable imagination of a young girl. He declined to judge for himself;\nhe persisted in appealing to me. When I told the little love-story of the\ntwo young people, one event in it appeared to make a very strong\nimpression on him. The effect produced on Lucilla (when she first heard\nit) by the sound of his brother's voice, dwelt strangely on his mind. He\nfailed to understand it; he ridiculed it; he declined to believe it. I\nwas obliged to remind him that Lucilla was blind, and that love which, in\nother cases, first finds its way to the heart through the eyes, could\nonly, in her case, first find its way through the ears. My explanation,\nthus offered, had its effect: it set him thinking. \"The sound of his\nvoice!\" he said to himself, still turning the problem over and over in\nhis mind. \"People say my voice is exactly like Oscar's,\" he added,\nsuddenly addressing himself to me. \"Do you think so too?\" I answered that\nthere could be no doubt of it. He got up from his chair, with a quick\nlittle shudder, like a man who feels a chill--and changed the subject. On\nthe next occasion when he and Lucilla met--so far from being more\nfamiliar with her, he was more constrained than ever. As it had begun\nbetween these two, so it seemed likely to continue to the end. In my\nsociety, he was always at his ease. In Lucilla's society, never!\n\nWhat was the obvious conclusion which a person with my experience ought\nto have drawn from all this?\n\nI know well enough what it was, now. On my oath as an honest woman, I\nfailed to see it at the time. We are not always (suffer me to remind you)\nconsistent with ourselves. The cleverest people commit occasional lapses\ninto stupidity--just as the stupid people light up with gleams of\nintelligence at certain times. You may have shown your usual good sense\nin conducting your affairs on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in the week.\nBut it doesn't at all follow from this, that you may not make a fool of\nyourself on Thursday. Account for it as you may--for a much longer time\nthan it suits my self-esteem to reckon up, I suspected nothing and\ndiscovered nothing. I noted his behavior in Lucilla's presence as odd\nbehavior and unaccountable behavior--and that was all.\n\n\n\nDuring the first fortnight just mentioned, the London doctor came to see\nOscar.\n\nHe left again, perfectly satisfied with the results of his treatment. The\ndreadful epileptic malady would torture the patient and shock the friends\nabout him no more: the marriage might safely be celebrated at the time\nagreed on. Oscar was cured.\n\nThe doctor's visit--reviving our interest in observing the effect of the\nmedicine--also revived the subject of Oscar's false position towards\nLucilla. Nugent and I held a debate about it between ourselves. I opened\nthe interview by suggesting that we should unite our forces to persuade\nhis brother into taking the frank and manly course. Nugent neither said\nYes nor No to that proposal at the outset. He, who made up his mind at a\nmoment's notice about everything else, took time to decide on this one\noccasion.\n\n\"There is something that I want to know first,\" he said. \"I want to\nunderstand this curious antipathy of Lucilla's which my brother regards\nwith so much alarm. Can you explain it?\"\n\n\"Has Oscar attempted to explain it?\" I inquired on my side.\n\n\"He mentioned it in one of his letters to me; and he tried to explain it,\nwhen I asked (on my arrival at Browndown) if Lucilla had discovered the\nchange in his complexion. But he failed entirely to meet my difficulty in\nunderstanding the case.\"\n\n\"What is your difficulty?\"\n\n\"This. So far as I can see, she fails to discover intuitively the\npresence of dark people in a room, or of dark colors in the ornaments of\na room. It is only when _she is told_ that such persons or such things\nare present that her prejudice declares itself. In what state of mind\ndoes such a strange feeling as this take its rise? It seems impossible\nthat she can have any conscious associations with colors, pleasant or\npainful--if it is true that she was blind at a year old. How do you\naccount for it? Can there be such a thing as a purely instinctive\nantipathy; remaining passive until external influences rouse it; and\nresting on no sort of practical experience whatever?\"\n\n\"I think there may be,\" I replied. \"Why, when I was a child just able to\nwalk, did I shrink away from the first dog I saw who barked at me? I\ncould not have known, at that age, either by experience or teaching, that\na dog's bark is sometimes the prelude to a dog's bite. My terror, on that\noccasion, was purely instinctive surely?\"\n\n\"Ingeniously put,\" he said. \"But I am not satisfied yet.\"\n\n\"You must also remember,\" I continued, \"that she has a positively painful\nassociation with dark colors, on certain occasions. They sometimes\nproduce a disagreeable impression on her nerves, through her sense of\ntouch. She discovered, in that way, that I had a dark gown on, on the day\nwhen I first saw her.\"\n\n\"And yet, she touches my brother's face, and fails to discover any\nalteration in it.\"\n\nI met that objection also--to my own satisfaction, though not to his.\n\n\"I am far from sure that she might not have made the discovery,\" I said,\n\"if she had touched him for the first time, since the discoloration of\nhis face. But she examines him now with a settled impression in her mind,\nderived from previous experience of what she has felt in touching his\nskin. Allow for the modifying influence of that impression on her sense\nof touch--and remember at the same time, that it is the color and not the\ntexture of the skin that is changed--and his escape from discovery\nbecomes, to my mind, intelligible.\"\n\nHe shook his head; he owned he could not dispute my view. But he was not\ncontent for all that.\n\n\"Have you made any inquiries,\" he asked, \"about the period of her infancy\nbefore she was blind? She may be still feeling, indirectly and\nunconsciously, the effect of some shock to her nervous system in the time\nwhen she could see.\"\n\n\"I have never thought of making inquiries.\"\n\n\"Is there anybody within our reach, who was familiarly associated with\nher in the first year of her life? It is hardly likely, I am afraid, at\nthis distance of time?\"\n\n\"There is a person now in the house,\" I said. \"Her old nurse is still\nliving.\"\n\n\"Send for her directly.\"\n\nZillah appeared. After first explaining what he wanted with her, Nugent\nwent straight to the inquiry which he had in view.\n\n\"Was your young lady ever frightened when she was a baby by any dark\nperson, or any dark thing, suddenly appearing before her?\"\n\n\"Never, sir! I took good care to let nothing come near her that could\nfrighten her--so long, poor little thing, as she could see.\"\n\n\"Are you quite sure you can depend on your memory?\"\n\n\"Quite sure, sir--when it's a long time ago.\"\n\nZillah was dismissed. Nugent--thus far, unusually grave, and unusually\nanxious--turned to me with an air of relief.\n\n\"When you proposed to me to join you in forcing Oscar to speak out,\" he\nsaid, \"I was not quite easy in my mind about the consequences. After what\nI have just heard, my fear is removed.\"\n\n\"What fear?\" I asked.\n\n\"The fear of Oscar's confession producing an estrangement between them\nwhich might delay the marriage. I am against all delays. I am especially\nanxious that Oscar's marriage should not be put off. When we began our\nconversation, I own to you I was of Oscar's opinion that he would do\nwisely to let marriage make him sure of his position in her affections,\nbefore he risked the disclosure. Now--after what the nurse has told us--I\nsee no risk worth considering.\"\n\n\"In short,\" I said, \"you agree with me?\"\n\n\"I agree with you--though I _am_ the most opinionated man living. The\nchances now seem to me to be all in Oscar's favor, Lucilla's antipathy is\nnot what I feared it was--an antipathy firmly rooted in a constitutional\nmalady. It is nothing more serious,\" said Nugent, deciding the question,\nat once and for ever, with the air of a man profoundly versed in\nphysiology--\"it is nothing more serious than a fanciful growth, a morbid\naccident, of her blindness. She may live to get over it--she would, I\nbelieve, certainly get over it, if she could see. In two words, after\nwhat I have found out this morning, I say as you say--Oscar is making a\nmountain out of a molehill. He ought to have put himself right with\nLucilla long since. I have unbounded influence over him. It shall back\nyour influence. Oscar shall make a clean breast of it, before the week is\nout.\"\n\nWe shook hands on that bargain. As I looked at him--bright and dashing\nand resolute; Oscar, as I had always wished Oscar to be--I own to my\nshame I privately regretted that we had not met Nugent in the twilight,\non that evening of ours which had opened to Lucilla the gates of a new\nlife.\n\nHaving said to each other all that we had to say--our two lovers being\naway together at the time, for a walk on the hills--we separated, as I\nthen supposed, for the rest of the day. Nugent went to the inn, to look\nat a stable which he proposed converting into a studio: no room at\nBrowndown being half large enough, for the first prodigious picture with\nwhich the \"Grand Consoler\" in Art proposed to astonish the world. As for\nme, having nothing particular to do, I went out to see if I could meet\nOscar and Lucilla on their return from their walk.\n\nFailing to find them, I strolled back by way of Browndown. Nugent was\nsitting alone on the low wall in front of the house, smoking a cigar. He\nrose and came to meet me, with his finger placed mysteriously on his\nlips.\n\n\"You mustn't come in,\" he said; \"you mustn't speak loud enough to be\nheard.\" He pointed round the corner of the house to the little room at\nthe side, already familiar to you in these pages. \"Oscar and Lucilla are\nshut up together there. And Oscar is making his confession to her at this\nmoment!\"\n\nI lifted my hands and eyes in astonishment. Nugent went on.\n\n\"I see you want to know how it has all come about. You shall know.--While\nI was looking at the stable (it isn't half big enough for a studio for\nMe!), Oscar's servant brought me a little pencil note, entreating me, in\nOscar's name, to go to him directly at Browndown. I found him waiting out\nhere, dreadfully agitated. He cautioned me (just as I have cautioned you)\nnot to speak loud. For the same reason too. Lucilla was in the house----\"\n\n\"I thought they had gone out for a walk,\" I interposed.\n\n\"They did go out for a walk. But Lucilla complained of fatigue; and Oscar\nbrought her back to Browndown to rest. Well! I inquired what was the\nmatter. The answer informed me that the secret of Oscar's complexion had\nforced its way out for the second time, in Lucilla's hearing.\"\n\n\"Jicks again!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"No--not Jicks. Oscar's own man-servant, this time.\"\n\n\"How did it happen?\"\n\n\"It happened through one of the boys in the village. Oscar and Lucilla\nfound the little imp howling outside the house. They asked what was the\nmatter. The imp told them that the servant at Browndown had beaten him.\nLucilla was indignant. She insisted on having the thing inquired into.\nOscar left her in the drawing-room (unluckily, as it turned out, without\nshutting the door); called the man up into the passage, and asked what he\nmeant by ill-using the boy. The man answered, 'I boxed his ears, sir, as\nan example to the rest of them.' 'What did he do?' 'Rapped at the door,\nsir, with a stick (he is not the first who has done it when you are out);\nand asked if Blue Face was at home.' Lucilla heard every word of it,\nthrough the open door. Need I tell you what happened next?\"\n\nIt was quite needless to relate that part of the story. I remembered too\nwell what had happened on the former occasion, in the garden. I saw too\nplainly that Lucilla must have connected the two occurrences in her mind,\nand must have had her ready suspicion roused to serious action, as the\nnecessary result.\n\n\"I understand,\" I said. \"Of course, she insisted on an explanation. Of\ncourse, Oscar compromised himself by a clumsy excuse, and wanted you to\nhelp him. What did you do?\"\n\n\"What I told you I should do this morning. He had counted confidently on\nmy taking his side--it was pitiable to see him, poor fellow! Still, for\nhis own sake, I refused to yield. I left him the choice of giving her the\ntrue explanation himself, or of leaving me to do it. There wasn't a\nmoment to lose; she was in no humour to be trifled with, I can tell you!\nOscar behaved very well about it--he always behaves well when I drive him\ninto a corner! In one word, he was man enough to feel that he was the\nright person to make a clean breast of it--not I. I gave the poor old boy\na hug to encourage him, pushed him into the room, shut the door on him,\nand came out here. He ought to have done it by this time. He _has_ done\nit! Here he comes!\"\n\nOscar ran out, bareheaded, from the house. There were signs of\ndisturbance in him, as he approached us, which warned me that something\nhad gone wrong, before he opened his lips.\n\nNugent spoke first.\n\n\"What's amiss now?\" he asked. \"Have you told her the truth?\"\n\n\"I have tried to tell her the truth.\"\n\n\"Tried? What do you mean?\"\n\nOscar put his arm round his brother's neck, and laid his head on his\nbrother's shoulder, without answering one word.\n\nI put a question to him on my side.\n\n\"Did Lucilla refuse to listen to you?\" I asked.\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Has she said anything or done anything----?\"\n\nHe lifted his head from his brother's shoulder, and stopped me before I\ncould finish the sentence.\n\n\"You need feel no anxiety about Lucilla. Lucilla's curiosity is\nsatisfied.\"\n\nNugent and I gazed at one another, in complete bewilderment. Lucilla had\nheard it all; Lucilla's curiosity was satisfied. He had that incredibly\nhappy result to communicate to us--and he announced it with a look of\nhumiliation, in a tone of despair! Nugent's patience gave way.\n\n\"Let us have an end of this mystification,\" he said, putting Oscar back\nfrom him, sharply, at arm's length. \"I want a plain answer to a plain\nquestion. She knows that the boy knocked at the door, and asked if Blue\nFace was at home. Does she know what the boy's impudence meant? Yes? or\nNo?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Does she know that it is you who are Blue Face?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"No!!! Who else does she think it is?\"\n\nAs he asked the question, Lucilla appeared at the door of the house. She\nmoved her blind face inquiringly first one way, then the other. \"Oscar!\"\nshe called out, \"why have you left me alone? where are you?\"\n\nOscar turned, trembling, to his brother.\n\n\"For God's sake forgive me, Nugent!\" he said. \"She thinks it's YOU.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-SIXTH\n\nHe proves Equal to the Occasion\n\nAT that astounding confession, abruptly revealed in those plain words,\neven resolute Nugent lost all power of self-control. He burst out with a\ncry which reached Lucilla's ears. She instantly turned towards us, and\ninstantly assumed that the cry had come from Oscar's lips.\n\n\"Ah! there you are!\" she exclaimed. \"Oscar! Oscar! what is the matter\nwith you to-day?\"\n\nOscar was incapable of answering her. He had cast one glance of entreaty\nat his brother as Lucilla came nearer to us. The mute reproach which had\nanswered him, in Nugent's eyes, had broken down his last reserves of\nendurance. He was crying silently on Nugent's breast.\n\nIt was necessary that one of us should make his, or her, voice heard. I\nspoke first.\n\n\"Nothing is the matter, my dear,\" I said, advancing to meet Lucilla. \"We\nwere passing the house, and Oscar ran out to stop us and bring us in.\"\n\nMy excuses roused a new alarm in her.\n\n\"Us?\" she repeated. \"Who is with you?\"\n\n\"Nugent is with me.\"\n\nThe result of the deplorable misunderstanding which had taken place,\ninstantly declared itself. She turned deadly pale under the horror of\nfeeling that she was in the presence of the man with the blue face.\n\n\"Take me near enough to speak to him, but not to touch him,\" she\nwhispered. \"I have heard what he is like. (Oh, if you saw him, as I see\nhim, _in the dark!_) I must control myself. I must speak to Oscar's\nbrother, for Oscar's sake.\"\n\nShe seized my arm and held me close to her. What ought I to have said?\nWhat ought I to have done? I neither knew what to say or what to do. I\nlooked from Lucilla to the twin brothers. There was Oscar the Weak,\noverwhelmed by the humiliating position in which he had placed himself\ntowards the woman whom he was to marry, towards the brother whom he\nloved! And there was Nugent the Strong, master of himself; with his arm\nround his brother, with his head erect, with his hand signing to me to\nkeep silence. He was right. I had only to look back at Lucilla's face to\nsee that the delicate and perilous work of undeceiving her, was not work\nto be done at a moment's notice, on the spot.\n\n\"You are not yourself to-day,\" I said to her. \"Let us go home.\"\n\n\"No!\" she answered. \"I must accustom myself to speak to him. I will begin\nto-day. Take me to him--but don't let him touch me!\"\n\nNugent disengaged himself from Oscar--whose unfitness to help us through\nour difficulties was too manifest to be mistaken--as he saw us\napproaching. He pointed to the low wall in front of the house, and\nmotioned to his brother to wait there out of the way before Lucilla could\nspeak to him again. The wisdom of this proceeding was not long in\nasserting itself. Lucilla asked for Oscar the moment after he had left\nus. Nugent answered that Oscar had gone back to the house to get his hat.\n\nThe sound of Nugent's voice helped her to calculate her distance from him\nwithout assistance from me. Still holding my arm, she stopped and spoke\nto him.\n\n\"Nugent,\" she said, \"I have made Oscar tell me--what he ought to have\ntold me long since.\" (She paused between each sentence; painfully\ncontrolling herself, painfully catching her breath.) \"He has discovered a\nfoolish antipathy of mine. I don't know how; I tried to keep it a secret\nfrom him. I need not tell you what it is.\"\n\nShe made a longer pause at those words, holding me closer and closer to\nher; struggling more and more painfully against the irresistible nervous\nloathing that had got possession of her.\n\nHe listened, on his side, with the constraint which always fell upon him\nin her presence more marked than ever. His eyes were on the ground. He\nseemed reluctant even to look at her.\n\n\"I think I understand,\" she went on, \"why Oscar was unwilling to tell\nme----\" she stopped, at a loss how to express herself without running the\nrisk of hurting his feelings--\"to tell me,\" she resumed, \"what it is in\nyou which is not like other people. He was afraid my stupid weakness\nmight prejudice me against you. I wish to say that I won't let it do\nthat. I never was more ashamed of it than now. I, too, have my\nmisfortune. I ought to sympathize with you, instead of----\"\n\nHer voice had been growing fainter and fainter as she proceeded. She\nleaned against me heavily. One glance at her told me that if I let it go\non any longer she would fall into a swoon. \"Tell your brother that we\nhave gone back to the rectory,\" I said to Nugent. He looked up at Lucilla\nfor the first time.\n\n\"You are right,\" he answered. \"Take her home.\" He repeated the sign by\nwhich he had already hinted to me to be silent--and joined Oscar at the\nwall in front of the house.\n\n\"Has he gone?\" she asked.\n\n\"He has gone.\"\n\nThe moisture stood thick on her forehead. I passed my handkerchief over\nher face, and turned her towards the wind.\n\n\"Are you better now?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Can you walk home?\"\n\n\"Easily.\"\n\nI put her arm in mine. After advancing with me a few steps, she suddenly\nstopped--with a blind apprehension, as it seemed, of something in front\nof her. She lifted her little walking-cane, and moved it slowly backwards\nand forwards in the empty air, with the action of some one who is\nclearing away an encumbrance to a free advance--say the action of a\nperson walking in a thick wood, and pushing aside the lower twigs and\nbranches that intercept the way.\n\n\"What are you about?\" I asked.\n\n\"Clearing the air,\" she answered. \"The air is full of him. I am in a\nforest of hovering figures, with faces of black-blue. Give me your arm.\nCome through!\"\n\n\"Lucilla!\"\n\n\"Don't be angry with me. I am coming to my senses again. Nobody knows\nwhat folly, what madness it is, better than I do. I have a will of my\nown: suffer as I may, I promise to break myself of it this time. I can't,\nand won't let Oscar's brother see that he is an object of horror to me.\"\nShe stopped once more, and gave me a little propitiatory kiss. \"Blame my\nblindness, dear, don't blame _me._ If I could only see--! Ah, how can I\nmake you understand me, you who don't live in the dark?\" She went on a\nfew paces, silent and thoughtful--and then spoke again. \"You won't laugh\nat me, if I say something?\"\n\n\"You know I won't.\"\n\n\"Suppose yourself to be in bed at night.\"\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"I have heard people say that they have sometimes woke in the middle of\nthe night, on a sudden, without any noise to disturb them. And they have\nfancied (without anything particular to justify it) that there was\nsomething, or somebody, in the dark room. Has that ever happened to you?\"\n\n\"Certainly, my love.--It has happened to most people to fancy what you\nsay, when their nerves are a little out of order.\"\n\n\"Very well. There is _my_ fancy, and there are _my_ nerves. When it\nhappened to you, what did you do?\"\n\n\"I struck a light, and satisfied myself that I was wrong.\"\n\n\"Suppose yourself without candle or matches, in a night without end, left\nalone with your fancy in the dark. There you have Me! It would not be\neasy, would it, to satisfy yourself; if you were in that helpless\ncondition? You might suffer under it--very unreasonably--and yet very\nkeenly for all that.\" She lifted her little cane, with a sad smile. \"You\nmight be almost as great a fool as poor Lucilla, and clear the air before\nyou with this!\"\n\nThe charm of her voice and her manner, added to the touching simplicity,\nthe pathetic truth of those words. She made me realize, as I had never\nrealized before, what it is to have, at one and the same time, the\nblessing of imagination, and the curse of blindness. For a moment, I was\nabsorbed in my admiration and my love for her. For a moment, I forgot the\nterrible position in which we were all placed. She unconsciously recalled\nit to me when she spoke next.\n\n\"Perhaps I was wrong to force the truth out of Oscar?\" she said, putting\nher arm again in mine, and walking on. \"I might have reconciled myself to\nhis brother, if I had never known what his brother was like. And yet I\nfelt there was something strange in him, without being told, and without\nknowing what it was. There must have been a reason in me for the dislike\nthat I felt for him from the first.\"\n\nThose words appeared to me to indicate the state of mind which had led to\nLucilla's deplorable mistake. I cautiously put some questions to her to\ntest the correctness of my own idea.\n\n\"You spoke just now of forcing the truth out of Oscar,\" I said, \"What\nmade you suspect that he was concealing the truth from you?\"\n\n\"He was so strangely embarrassed and confused,\" she answered. \"Anybody in\nmy place would have suspected him of concealing the truth.\"\n\nSo far the answer was conclusive.\n\n\"And how came you to find out what the truth really was?\" I asked next.\n\n\"I guessed at it,\" she replied, \"from something he said in referring to\nhis brother. You know that I took a fanciful dislike to Nugent Dubourg\nbefore he came to Dimchurch?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"And you remember that my prejudice against him was confirmed, on the\nfirst day when I passed my hand over his face to compare it with his\nbrother's.\"\n\n\"I remember.\"\n\n\"Well--while Oscar was rambling and contradicting himself--he said\nsomething (a mere trifle) which suggested to me that the person with the\nblue face must be his brother. There was the explanation that I had\nsought for in vain--the explanation of my persistent dislike to Nugent!\nThat horrid dark face of his must have produced some influence on me when\nI first touched it, like the influence which your horrid purple dress\nproduced on me, when I first touched _that._ Don't you see?\"\n\nI saw but too plainly. Oscar had been indebted for his escape from\ndiscovery entirely to Lucilla's misinterpretation of his language. And\nLucilla's misinterpretation now stood revealed as the natural product of\nher anxiety to account for her prejudice against Nugent Dubourg. Although\nthe mischief had been done--still, for the quieting of my own conscience,\nI made an attempt to shake her faith in the false conclusion at which she\nhad arrived.\n\n\"There is one thing I don't see yet,\" I said. \"I don't understand Oscar's\nembarrassment in speaking to you. As you interpret him, what had he to be\nafraid of?\"\n\nShe smiled satirically.\n\n\"What has become of your memory, my dear?\" she asked. \"What were you\nafraid of? You certainly never said a word to me of this poor man's\ndeformity. You felt yourself, I suppose, (just as Oscar felt himself),\nplaced between a choice of difficulties. On one side, my dislike of dark\ncolors and dark people warned Oscar to hold his tongue. On the other, my\nhatred of having advantage taken of my blindness to keep things secret\nfrom me, pressed him to speak out. Isn't that enough--with his shy\ndisposition, poor fellow--to account for his being embarrassed? Besides,\"\nshe added, speaking more seriously, \"perhaps he saw in my manner towards\nhim that he had disappointed and pained me.\"\n\n\"How?\" I asked.\n\n\"Don't you remember his once acknowledging in the garden that he had\npainted his face in the character of Bluebeard, to amuse the children? It\nwas not delicate, it was not affectionate--it was not like him--to show\nsuch insensibility as that to his brother's shocking disfigurement. He\nought to have remembered it, he ought to have respected it. There! we\nwill say no more. We will go indoors and open the piano and try to\nforget.\"\n\nEven Oscar's clumsy excuse in the garden--instead of confirming her\nsuspicion--had lent itself to strengthen the foregone conclusion rooted\nin her mind! At that critical moment--before I had consulted with the\ntwin-brothers as to what was to be done next--it was impossible to say\nmore. I felt seriously alarmed when I thought of the future. When she was\ntold--as told she must be--of the dreadful delusion into which she had\nfallen, what would be the result to Oscar? what would be the effect on\nherself? I own I shrank from pursuing the inquiry.\n\nWhen we reached the turn in the valley, I looked back at Browndown for\nthe last time. The twin-brothers were still in the place at which we had\nleft them. Though the faces were indistinguishable, I could still see the\nfigures plainly--Oscar sitting crouched up on the wall; Nugent erect at\nhis side, with one hand laid on his shoulder. Even at that distance, the\ntypes of the two characters were expressed in the attitudes of the two\nmen. As we entered the new winding of the valley which shut them out from\nview, I felt (so easy is it to comfort a woman!) that the commanding\nposition of Nugent had produced its encouraging impression on my mind.\n\"He will find a way out of it,\" I said to myself, \"Nugent will help us\nthrough!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-SEVENTH\n\nHe finds a Way out of it\n\nWE sat down at the piano, as Lucilla had proposed. She wished me to play\nfirst, and to play alone. I was teaching her, at the time, one of the\n_Sonatas_ of Mozart; and I now tried to go on with the lesson. Never\nbefore, or since, have I played so badly, as on that day! The divine\nserenity and completeness by which Mozart's music is, to my mind, raised\nabove all other music that ever was written, can only be worthily\ninterpreted by a player whose whole mind is given undividedly to the\nwork. Devoured as I then was by my own anxieties, I might profane those\nheavenly melodies--I could not play them. Lucilla accepted my excuses,\nand took my place.\n\nHalf an hour passed, without news from Browndown.\n\nCalculated by reference to itself, half an hour is no doubt a short space\nof time. Calculated by reference to your own suspense, while your own\ninterests are at stake, half an hour is an eternity. Every minute that\npassed, leaving Lucilla still undisturbed in her delusion, was a minute\nthat pricked me in the conscience. The longer we left her in ignorance,\nthe more painful to all of us the hard duty of enlightening her would\nbecome. I began to get restless. Lucilla, on her side, began to complain\nof fatigue. After the agitation that she had gone through, the inevitable\nreaction had come. I recommended her to go to her room and rest. She took\nmy advice. In the state of my mind at that time, it was an inexpressible\nrelief to me to be left by myself.\n\nAfter pacing backwards and forwards for some little time in the\nsitting-room, and trying vainly to see my way through the difficulties\nthat now beset us, I made up my mind to wait no longer for the news that\nnever came. The brothers were still at Browndown. To Browndown I\ndetermined to return.\n\nI peeped quietly into Lucilla's room. She was asleep. After a word to\nZillah, recommending her young mistress to her care, I slipped out. As I\ncrossed the lawn, I heard the garden-gate opened. In a minute more, the\nman of all others whom I most wanted to see, presented himself before me,\nin the person of Nugent Dubourg. He had borrowed Oscar's key, and had set\noff alone for the rectory to tell me what had passed between his brother\nand himself.\n\n\"This is the first stroke of luck that has fallen to me to-day,\" he said.\n\"I was wondering how I should contrive to speak to you privately. And\nhere you are--accessible and alone. Where is Lucilla? Can we depend on\nhaving the garden to ourselves?\"\n\nI satisfied him on both those points. He looked sadly pale and worn.\nBefore he opened his lips, I saw that he too had had his mind disturbed,\nand his patience tried, since I had left him. There was a summer-house at\nthe end of the garden with a view over the breezy solitude of the Downs.\nHere we established ourselves; and here, in my headlong way, I opened the\ninterview with the one formidable question:--\"Who is to tell her of the\nmistake she has made?\"\n\n\"Nobody is to tell her.\"\n\nThat answer staggered me at the outset. I looked at Nugent in silent\nastonishment.\n\n\"There is nothing to be surprised at,\" he said. \"Let me put my point of\nview before you in two words. I have had a serious talk with Oscar--\"\n\nWomen are proverbially bad listeners--and I am no better than the rest of\nthem. I interrupted him, before he could get any farther.\n\n\"I suppose Oscar has told you how the mistake happened?\" I said.\n\n\"He has no idea how it happened. He owns--when he found himself face to\nface with her--that his presence of mind completely failed him: he didn't\nhimself know what he was saying at the time. _He_ lost his head; and\n_she_ lost her patience. Think of his nervous confusion in collision with\nher nervous irritability--and the result explains itself: nothing _could_\ncome of it but misapprehension and mistake. I turned the thing over in my\nmind, after you had left us; and the one course to take that _I_ could\nsee was to accept the position patiently, and to make the best instead of\nthe worst of it. Having reached this conclusion, I settled the matter (as\nI settle most other difficulties)--by cutting the Gordian knot. I said to\nOscar, 'Would it be a relief to your mind to leave her present impression\nundisturbed until you are married?' You know him--I needn't tell you what\nhis answer was. 'Very well,' I said. 'Dry your eyes and compose yourself.\nI have begun as Blue Face. As Blue Face I will go on till further\nnotice.' I spare you the description of Oscar's gratitude. I proposed;\nand he accepted. There is the way out of the difficulty as I see it.\"\n\n\"Your way out of the difficulty is an unworthy way, and a false way,\" I\nanswered. \"I protest against taking that cruel advantage of Lucilla's\nblindness. I refuse to have anything to do with it.\"\n\nHe opened his case, and took out a cigar.\n\n\"Do as you please,\" he said. \"You saw the pitiable state she was in, when\nshe forced herself to speak to me. You saw how her disgust and horror\noverpowered her at the end. Transfer that disgust and horror to Oscar\n(with indignation and contempt added in _his_ case); expose him to the\nresult of rousing those feelings in her, before he is fortified by a\nhusband's influence over her mind, and a husband's place in her\naffections--if you dare. I love the poor fellow; and _I_ daren't. May I\nsmoke?\"\n\nI gave him his permission to smoke by a gesture. Before I said anything\nmore to this inscrutable gentleman, I felt the necessity of understanding\nhim--if I could.\n\nThere was no difficulty in accounting for his readiness to sacrifice\nhimself in the interests of Oscar's tranquillity. He never did things by\nhalves--he liked dashing at difficulties which would have made other men\npause. The same zeal in his brother's service which had saved Oscar's\nlife at the Trial, might well be the zeal that animated him now. The\nperplexity that I felt was not roused in me by the course that he had\ntaken--but by the language in which he justified himself, and, more\nstill, by his behavior to me while he was speaking. The well-bred\nbrilliant young fellow of my previous experience, had now turned as\ndogged and as ungracious as a man could be. He waited to hear what I had\nto say to him next, with a hard defiance and desperation of manner\nentirely uncalled for by the circumstances, and entirely out of harmony\nwith his character, so far as I had observed it. That there was something\nlurking under the surface, some inner motive at work in him which he was\nconcealing from his brother and concealing from me, was as plainly\nvisible as the sunshine and shade on the view that I was looking at from\nthe summer-house. But what that something was, or what that inner motive\nmight be, it baffled my utmost sagacity to guess. Not the faintest idea\nof the terrible secret that he was hiding from me, crossed my mind.\nInnocent of all suspicion of the truth, there I sat opposite to him, the\nunconscious witness of that unhappy man's final struggle to be true to\nthe brother whom he loved, and to master the devouring passion that\nconsumed him. So long as Lucilla falsely believed him to be disfigured by\nthe drug, so long the commonest consideration for her tranquillity would,\nin the estimation of others, excuse and explain his keeping out of her\npresence. In that separation, lay his last chance of raising an\ninsurmountable barrier between Lucilla and himself. He had already tried\nuselessly to place another obstacle in the way--he had vainly attempted\nto hasten the marriage which would have made Lucilla sacred to him as his\nbrother's wife. That effort having failed, there was but one honorable\nalternative left to him--to keep out of her society, until she was\nmarried to Oscar. He had accepted the position in which Oscar had placed\nhim, as the one means of reaching the end in view without exciting\nsuspicion of the truth--and he had encountered, as his reward for the\nsacrifice, my ignorant protest, my stupid opposition, set as obstacles in\nhis way! There were the motives--the pure, the noble motives--which\nanimated him, as I know them now. There is the right reading of the\ndogged language that mystified me, of the defiant manner that offended\nme; interpreted by the one light that I have to guide my pen--the light\nof later events!\n\n\"Well?\" he said. \"Are we allies, or not? Are you with me or against me?\"\n\nI gave up attempting to understand him; and answered that plain question,\nplainly.\n\n\"I don't deny that the consequences of undeceiving her may be serious,\" I\nsaid. \"But, for all that, I will have no share in the cruelty of keeping\nher deceived.\"\n\nNugent held up his forefinger, warningly.\n\n\"Pause, and reflect, Madame Pratolungo! The mischief that you may do, as\nmatters stand now, may be mischief that you can never repair. It's\nuseless to ask you to alter your mind. I only ask you to wait a little.\nThere is plenty of time before the wedding-day. Something may happen\nwhich will spare you the necessity of enlightening Lucilla with your own\nlips.\"\n\n\"What can happen?\" I asked.\n\n\"Lucilla may yet see him, as we see him,\" Nugent answered. \"Lucilla's own\neyes may discover the truth.\"\n\n\"What! have you not abandoned the mad notion of curing her blindness,\nyet?\"\n\n\"I will abandon my notion when the German surgeon tells me it is mad. Not\nbefore.\"\n\n\"Have you said anything about it to Oscar?\"\n\n\"Not a word. I shall say nothing about it to anybody but you, until the\nGerman is safe on the shores of England.\"\n\n\"Do you expect him to arrive before the marriage?\"\n\n\"Certainly! He would have left New York with me, but for one patient who\nstill required his care. No new patients will tempt him to stay in\nAmerica. His extraordinary success has made his fortune. The ambition of\nhis life is to see England: and he can afford to gratify it. He may be\nhere by the next steamer that reaches Liverpool.\"\n\n\"And when he does come, you mean to bring him to Dimchurch?\"\n\n\"Yes--unless Lucilla objects to it.\"\n\n\"Suppose Oscar objects? She is resigned to be blind for life. If you\ndisturb that resignation with no useful result, you may make an unhappy\nwoman of her for the rest of her days. In your brother's place, I should\nobject to running that risk.\"\n\n\"My brother is doubly interested in running the risk. I repeat what I\nhave already told you. The physical result will not be the only result,\nif her sight can be restored. There will be a new mind put into her as\nwell as a new sense. Oscar has everything to dread from this morbid fancy\nof hers as long as she is blind. Only let her eyes correct her\nfancy--only let her see him as we see him, and get used to him, as we\nhave got used to him; and Oscar's future with her is safe. Will you leave\nthings as they are for the present, on the chance that the German surgeon\nmay get here before the wedding-day?\"\n\nI consented to that; being influenced, in spite of myself, by the\nremarkable coincidence between what Nugent had just said of Lucilla, and\nwhat Lucilla had said to me of herself earlier in the day. It was\nimpossible to deny that Nugent's theory, wild as it sounded, found its\nconfirmation, so far, in Lucilla's view of her own case. Having settled\nthe difference between us in this way, for the time being, I shifted our\ntalk next to the difficult question of Nugent's relations towards\nLucilla. \"How are you to meet her again,\" I said, \"after the effect you\nproduced on her at the meeting to-day?\"\n\nHe spoke far more pleasantly in discussing this side of the subject. His\nlanguage and his manner both improved together.\n\n\"If I could have had my own way,\" he said, \"Lucilla would have been\nrelieved, by this time, of all fear of meeting with me again. She would\nhave heard from you, or from Oscar, that business had obliged me to leave\nDimchurch.\"\n\n\"Does Oscar object to let you go?\"\n\n\"He won't hear of my going. I did my best to persuade him--I promised to\nreturn for the marriage. Quite useless! 'If you leave me here by myself,'\nhe said, 'to think over the mischief I have done, and the sacrifices I\nhave forced on you--you will break my heart. You don't know what an\nencouragement your presence is to me; you don't know what a blank you\nwill leave in my life if you go!' I am as weak as Oscar is, when Oscar\nspeaks to me in that way. Against my own convictions, against my own\nwishes, I yielded. I should have been better away--far, far better away!\"\n\nHe said those closing words in a tone that startled me. It was nothing\nless than a tone of despair. How little I understood him then! how well I\nunderstand him now! In those melancholy accents, spoke the last of his\nhonor, the last of his truth. Miserable, innocent Lucia! Miserable,\nguilty Nugent!\n\n\"And now you remain at Dimchurch,\" I resumed, \"what are you to do?\"\n\n\"I must do my best to spare her the nervous suffering which I unwillingly\ninflicted on her to-day. The morbid repulsion that she feels in my\npresence is not to be controlled--I can see that plainly. I shall keep\nout of her way; gradually withdrawing myself, so as not to force my\nabsence on her attention. I shall pay fewer and fewer visits at the\nrectory, and remain longer and longer at Browndown every day. After they\nare married----\" He suddenly stopped; the words seemed to stick in his\nthroat. He busied himself in relighting his cigar, and took a long time\nto do it.\n\n\"After they are married,\" I repeated. \"What then?\"\n\n\"When Oscar is married, Oscar will not find my presence indispensable to\nhis happiness. I shall leave Dimchurch.\"\n\n\"You will have to give a reason.\"\n\n\"I shall give the true reason. I can find no studio here big enough for\nme--as I have told you. And, even if I could find a studio, I should be\ndoing no good, if I remained at Dimchurch. My intellect would contract,\nmy brains would rust, in this remote place. Let Oscar live his quiet\nmarried life here. And let me go to the atmosphere that is fitter for\nme--the atmosphere of London or Paris.\"\n\nHe sighed, and fixed his eyes absently on the open hilly view from the\nsummer-house door.\n\n\"It's strange to see _you_ depressed,\" I said. \"Your spirits seemed to be\nquite inexhaustible on that first evening when you interrupted Mr. Finch\nover _Hamlet._\"\n\nHe threw away the end of his cigar, and laughed bitterly.\n\n\"We artists are always in extremes,\" he said. \"What do you think I was\nwishing just before you spoke to me?\"\n\n\"I can't guess.\"\n\n\"I was wishing I had never come to Dimchurch!\"\n\nBefore I could return a word, on my side, Lucilla's voice reached our\nears, calling to me from the garden. Nugent instantly sprang to his feet.\n\n\"Have we said all we need say?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes--for to-day, at any rate.\"\n\n\"For to-day, then--good-bye.\"\n\nHe leapt up; caught the cross-bar of wood over the entrance to the\nsummer-house; and, swinging himself on to the low garden-wall beyond,\ndisappeared in the field on the other side. I answered Lucilla's call,\nand hastened away to find her. We met on the lawn. She looked wild and\npale, as if something had frightened her.\n\n\"Anything wrong at the rectory?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nothing wrong,\" she answered--\"except with Me. The next time I complain\nof fatigue, don't advise me to go and lie down on my bed.\"\n\n\"Why not? I looked in at you, before I came out here. You were fast\nasleep--the picture of repose.\"\n\n\"Repose? You never were more mistaken in your life. I was in the agony of\na horrid dream.\"\n\n\"You were perfectly quiet when I saw you.\"\n\n\"It must have been after you saw me, then. Let me come and sleep with you\nto-night. I daren't be by myself, if I dream of it again.\"\n\n\"What did you dream of?\"\n\n\"I dreamt that I was standing, in my wedding dress, before the altar of a\nstrange church; and that a clergyman whose voice I had never heard\nbefore, was marrying me----\" She stopped, impatiently waving her hand\nbefore her in the air. \"Blind as I am,\" she said, \"I see him again now!\"\n\n\"The bridegroom?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Oscar?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Who then?\"\n\n\"Oscar's brother. Nugent Dubourg.\"\n\n(Have I mentioned before, that I am sometimes a great fool? If I have\nnot, I beg to mention it now. I burst out laughing.)\n\n\"What is there to laugh at?\" she asked angrily. \"I saw his hideous,\ndiscolored face--I am never blind in my dreams! I felt his blue hand put\nthe ring on my finger. Wait! The worst part of it is to come. I married\nNugent Dubourg willingly--married him without a thought of my engagement\nto Oscar. Yes! yes! I know it's only a dream. I can't bear to think of\nit, for all that. I don't like to be false to Oscar even in a dream. Let\nus go to him. I want to hear him tell me that he loves me. Come to\nBrowndown. I'm so nervous, I don't like going by myself. Come to\nBrowndown!\"\n\nI have another humiliating confession to make--I tried to get off going\nto Browndown. (So like those unfeeling French people, isn't it?)\n\nBut I had my reason too. If I disapproved of the resolution at which\nNugent had arrived, I viewed far more unfavorably the selfish weakness on\nOscar's part, which had allowed his brother to sacrifice himself.\nLucilla's lover had sunk to something very like a despicable character in\nmy estimation. I felt that I might let him see what I thought of him, if\nI found myself in his company at that moment.\n\n\"Considering the object that you have in view, my dear,\" I said to\nLucilla, \"do you think you want _me_ at Browndown?\"\n\n\"Haven't I already told you?\" she asked impatiently. \"I am so nervous--so\ncompletely upset--that I don't feel equal to going out by myself. Have\nyou no sympathy for me? Suppose _you_ had dreamed that you were marrying\nNugent instead of Oscar?\"\n\n\"Ah, bah! what of that? I should only have dreamed that I was marrying\nthe most agreeable man of the two.\"\n\n\"The most agreeable man of the two! There you are again--always unjust to\nOscar.\"\n\n\"My love! if you could see for yourself, you would learn to appreciate\nNugent's good qualities, as I do.\"\n\n\"I prefer appreciating Oscar's good qualities.\"\n\n\"You are prejudiced, Lucilla.\"\n\n\"So are you!\"\n\n\"You happen to have met Oscar first.\"\n\n\"That has nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"Yes! yes! If Nugent had followed us, instead of Oscar; if, of those two\ncharming voices which are both the same, one had spoken instead of the\nother--\"\n\n\"I won't hear a word more!\"\n\n\"Tra-la-la-la! It happens to have been Oscar. Turn it the other way--and\nNugent might have been the man.\n\n\"Madame Pratolungo, I am not accustomed to be insulted! I have no more to\nsay to you.\"\n\nWith that dignified reply, and with the loveliest color in her face that\nyou ever saw in your life, my darling Lucilla turned her pretty back on\nme, and set off for Browndown by herself.\n\nAh, my rash tongue! Ah, my nasty foreign temper! Why did I let her\nirritate me? I, the elder of the two--why did I not set her an example of\nself-control? Who can tell? When does a woman know why she does anything?\nDid Eve know--when Mr. Serpent offered her the apple--why she ate it? not\nshe!\n\nWhat was to be done now? Two things were to be done. First thing:--To\ncool myself down. Second thing:--To follow Lucilla, and kiss and make it\nup.\n\nEither I took some time to cool--or, in the irritation of the moment,\nLucilla walked faster than usual. She had got to Browndown before I could\novertake her. On opening the house-door, I heard them talking. It would\nhardly do to disturb them--especially now I was in disgrace. While I was\nhesitating, and wondering what my next proceeding had better be, my eye\nwas attracted by a letter lying on the hall-table. I looked (one is\nalways inquisitive in those idle moments when one doesn't know what to\ndo)--I looked at the address. The letter was directed to Nugent; and the\npost-mark was Liverpool.\n\nI drew the inevitable conclusion. The German oculist was in England!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-EIGHTH\n\nHe crosses the Rubicon\n\nI WAS still in doubt, whether to enter the room, or to wait outside until\nshe left Browndown to return to the rectory--when Lucilla's keen sense of\nhearing decided the question which I had been unable to settle for\nmyself. The door of the room opened; and Oscar advanced into the hall.\n\n\"Lucilla insisted that she heard somebody outside,\" he said. \"Who could\nhave guessed it was you? Why did you wait in the hall? Come in! come in!\"\n\nHe held open the door for me; and I went in. Oscar announced me to\nLucilla. \"It was Madame Pratolungo you heard,\" he said. She took no\nnotice either of him or of me. A heap of flowers from Oscar's garden lay\nin her lap. With the help of her clever fingers, she was sorting them to\nmake a nosegay, as quickly and as tastefully as if she had possessed the\nsense of sight. In all my experience of that charming face, it had never\nlooked so hard as it looked now. Nobody would have recognized her\nlikeness to the Madonna of Raphael's picture. Offended--mortally offended\nwith me--I saw it at a glance.\n\n\"I hope you will forgive my intrusion, Lucilla, when you know my motive,\"\nI said. \"I have followed you here to make my excuses.\"\n\n\"Oh, don't think of making excuses!\" she rejoined, giving three-fourths\nof her attention to the flowers, and one-fourth to me. \"It's a pity you\ntook the trouble of coming here. I quite agree with what you said in the\ngarden. Considering the object I had in view at Browndown, I could not\npossibly expect you to accompany me. True! quite true!\"\n\nI kept my temper. Not that I am a patient woman: not that I possess a\nmeek disposition. Very far from it, I regret to say. Nevertheless, I kept\nmy temper--so far.\n\n\"I wish to apologize for what I said in the garden,\" I resumed. \"I spoke\nthoughtlessly, Lucilla. It is impossible that I could intentionally\noffend you.\"\n\nI might as well have spoken to one of the chairs. The whole of her\nattention became absorbed in the breathless interest of making her\nnosegay.\n\n\"_Was_ I offended?\" she said, addressing herself to the flowers.\n\"Excessively foolish of me, if I was.\" She suddenly became conscious of\nmy existence. \"You had a perfect right to express your opinion,\" she said\nloftily. \"Accept _my_ excuses if I appeared to dispute it.\"\n\nShe tossed her pretty head; she showed her brightest color; she tapped\nher nice little foot briskly on the floor. (Oh, Lucilla! Lucilla!) I\nstill kept my temper. More, by this time (I admit,) for Oscar's sake than\nfor her sake. He looked so distressed, poor fellow--so painfully anxious\nto interfere, without exactly knowing how.\n\n\"My dear Lucilla!\" he began. \"Surely you might answer Madame\nPratolungo----\"\n\nShe petulantly interrupted him, with another toss of the head--a little\nhigher than the last.\n\n\"I don't attempt to answer Madame Pratolungo! I prefer admitting that\nMadame Pratolungo may have been quite right. I dare say I am ready to\nfall in love with the first man who comes my way. I dare say--if I had\nmet your brother before I met you--I should have fallen in love with\n_him._ Quite likely!\"\n\n\"Quite likely--as you say,\"--answered poor Oscar, humbly. \"I am sure I\nthink it very lucky for _me,_ that you didn't meet Nugent first.\"\n\nShe threw her lapful of flowers away from her on the table at which she\nwas sitting. She became perfectly furious with him for taking my side. I\npermitted myself (the poor child could not see it, remember), the\nharmless indulgence of a smile.\n\n\"You agree with Madame Pratolungo,\" she said to him viciously. \"Madame\nPratolungo thinks your brother a much more agreeable man than you.\"\n\nHumble Oscar shook his head in melancholy acknowledgment of this\nself-evident fact. \"There can be no two opinions about that,\" he said\nresignedly.\n\nShe stamped her foot on the carpet--and raised quite a little cloud of\ndust. My lungs are occasionally delicate. I permitted myself another\nharmless indulgence--indulgence in a slight cough. She heard the second\nindulgence--and suddenly controlled herself, the instant it reached her\nears. I am afraid she took my cough as my commentary on what was going\non.\n\n\"Come here, Oscar,\" she said, with a complete change of tone and manner.\n\"Come and sit down by me.\"\n\nOscar obeyed.\n\n\"Put your arm round my waist.\"\n\nOscar looked at me. Having the use of his sight, he was sensible of the\nabsurd side of the demonstration required of him--in the presence of a\nthird person. She, poor soul, strong in her blind insensibility to all\nshafts of ridicule shot from the eye, cared nothing for the presence of a\nthird person. She repeated her commands, in a tone which said sharply,\n\"Embrace me--I am not to be trifled with.\"\n\nOscar timidly put his arm round her waist--with an appealing look at me.\nShe issued another command instantly.\n\n\"Say you love me.\"\n\nOscar hesitated.\n\n\"Say you love me!\"\n\nOscar whispered it.\n\n\"Out loud!\"\n\nEndurance has its limits: I began to lose my temper. She could not have\nbeen more superbly indifferent to my presence, if there had been a cat in\nthe room instead of a lady.\n\n\"Permit me to inform you,\" I said, \"that I have not (as you appear to\nsuppose) left the room.\"\n\nShe took no notice. She went on with her commands, rising irrepressibly\nfrom one amatory climax to another.\n\n\"Give me a kiss!\"\n\nUnhappy Oscar--sacrificed between us--blushed. Stop! Don't revel\nprematurely in the greatest enjoyment a reader has--namely, catching a\nwriter out in a mistake. I have not forgotten that his disfigured\ncomplexion would prevent his blush from showing on the surface. I beg to\nsay I saw it under the surface--saw it in his expression: I repeat--he\nblushed.\n\nI felt it necessary to assert myself for the second time.\n\n\"I have only one object in remaining in the room, Miss Finch. I merely\nwish to know whether you refuse to accept my excuses.\n\n\"Oscar! give me a kiss!\"\n\nHe still hesitated. She threw her arm round his neck. My duty to myself\nwas plain--my duty was to go.\n\n\"Good afternoon, Mr. Dubourg,\" I said--and turned to the door. She heard\nme cross the room, and called to me to stop. I paused. There was a glass\non the wall opposite to me. On the authority of the glass, I beg to\nmention that I paused in my most becoming manner. Grace tempered with\ndignity: dignity tempered with grace.\n\n\"Madame Pratolungo!\"\n\n\"Miss Finch?\"\n\n\"This is the man who is not half so agreeable as his brother. Look!\"\n\nShe tightened her hold round his neck, and gave him--ostentatiously gave\nhim--the kiss which he was ashamed to give _her._ I advanced, in\ncontemptuous silence, to the door. My attitude expressed disgust\naccompanied by sorrow: sorrow, accompanied by disgust.\n\n\"Madame Pratolungo!\"\n\nI made no answer.\n\n\"This is the man whom I should never have loved if I had happened to meet\nhis brother first. Look!\"\n\nShe put both arms round his neck; and gave him a shower of kisses all in\none. I indignantly withdrew. The door had been imperfectly closed when I\nhad entered the room: it was ajar. I pulled it open--and found myself\nface to face with Nugent Dubourg, standing by the table, with his letter\nfrom Liverpool in his hand! He must have certainly heard Lucilla cast my\nown words back in my teeth--if he had heard no more.\n\nI stopped short; looking at him in silent surprise. He smiled, and held\nout the open letter to me. Before we could speak, we heard the door of\nthe room closed. Oscar had followed me out (shutting the door behind him)\nto apologize for Lucilla's behavior to me. He explained what had happened\nto his brother. Nugent nodded, and tapped his open letter smartly. \"Leave\nme to manage it. I shall give you something better to do than quarreling\namong yourselves. You will hear what it is directly. In the meantime, I\nhave got a message for our friend at the inn. Gootheridge is on his way\nhere, to speak to me about altering the stable. Run and tell him I have\nother business on hand, and I can't keep my appointment to-day. Stop!\nGive him this at the same time, and ask him to leave it at the rectory.\"\n\nHe took one of his visiting cards out of the case, wrote a few lines on\nit in pencil, and handed it to his brother. Oscar (always ready to go on\nerrands for Nugent) hurried out to meet the landlord. Nugent turned to\nme.\n\n\"The German is in England,\" he said. \"Now I may open my lips.\"\n\n\"At once!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"At once. I have put off my own business (as you heard) in favor of this.\nMy friend will be in London to-morrow. I mean to get my authority to\nconsult him to-day, and to start tomorrow for town. Prepare yourself to\nmeet one of the strangest characters you ever set eyes on! You saw me\nwrite on my card. It was a message to Mr. Finch, asking him to join us\nimmediately (on important family business) at Browndown. As Lucilla's\nfather, he has a voice in the matter. When Oscar comes back, and when the\nrector joins us, our domestic privy council will be complete.\"\n\nHe spoke with his customary spirit; he moved with his customary\nbriskness--he had become quite himself again, since I had seen him last.\n\n\"I am stagnating in this place,\" he went on, seeing that I noticed the\nchange in him. \"It puts me in spirits again, having something to do. I am\nnot like Oscar--I must have action to stir my blood--action to keep me\nfrom fretting over my anxieties. How do you think I found the witness to\nmy brother's innocence at the Trial? In that way. I said to myself, 'I\nshall go mad if I don't do something.' I did something--and saved Oscar.\nI am going to do something again. Mark my words! Now I am stirring in it,\nLucilla will recover her sight.\"\n\n\"This is a serious matter,\" I said. \"Pray give it serious consideration.\"\n\n\"Consideration?\" he repeated. \"I hate the word. I always decide on the\ninstant. If I am wrong in my view of Lucilla's case, consideration is of\nno earthly use. If I am right, every day's delay is a day of sight lost\nto the blind. I'll wait for Oscar and Mr. Finch; and then I'll open the\nbusiness. Why are we talking in the hall? Come in!\"\n\nHe led the way to the sitting-room. I had a new interest, now, in going\nback. Still, Lucilla's behavior hung on my mind. Suppose she treated me\nwith renewed coldness and keener contempt? I remained standing at the\ntable in the hall. Nugent looked back at me, over his shoulder.\n\n\"Nonsense!\" he said. \"I'll set things right. It's beneath a woman like\nyou to take notice of what a girl says in a pet. Come in!\"\n\nI doubt if I should have yielded to please any other living man. But,\nthere is no denying it, some people have a magnetic attracting power over\nothers. Nugent had that power over me. Against my own will--for I was\nreally hurt and offended by her usage of me--I went back with him into\nthe room.\n\nLucilla was still sitting in the place which she had occupied when I\nwithdrew. On hearing the door open, and a man's footsteps entering, she\nof course assumed that the man was Oscar. She had penetrated his object\nin leaving her to follow me out, and it had not improved her temper.\n\n\"Oh?\" she said. \"You have come back at last? I thought you had offered\nyourself as Madame Pratolungo's escort to the rectory.\" She stopped, with\na sudden frown. Her quick ears had detected my return into the room.\n\"Oscar!\" she exclaimed, \"what does this mean? Madame Pratolungo and I\nhave nothing more to say to each other. What has she come back for? Why\ndon't you answer? This is infamous! I shall leave the room!\"\n\nThe utterance of that final threat was followed so rapidly by its\nexecution that, before Nugent (standing between her and the door) could\nget out of her way, she came in violent contact with him. She instantly\ncaught him by the arm, and shook him angrily. \"What does your silence\nmean? Is it at Madame Pratolungo's instigation that you are insulting\nme?\"\n\nI had just opened my lips to make one more attempt at reconciliation, by\nsaying some pacifying words to her--when she planted that last sting in\nme. French flesh and blood (whatever English flesh and blood might have\ndone) could bear no more. I silently turned my back on her, in a rage.\n\nAt the same moment, Nugent's eyes brightened as if a new idea had struck\nhim. He gave me one significant look--and answered her in his brother's\ncharacter. Whether he was possessed at the moment by some demon of\nmischief; or whether he had the idea of trying to make Oscar's peace for\nhim, before Oscar returned--was more than I could say at the time. I\nought to have stopped it--I know. But my temper was in a flame. I was as\nspiteful as a cat and as fierce as a bear. I said to myself (in your\nEnglish idiom), She wants taking down a peg; quite right, Mr. Nugent; do\nit. Shocking! shameful! no words are bad enough for me: give it me well.\nAh, Heaven! what is a human being in a rage? On my sacred word of honor,\nnothing but a human beast! The next time it happens to You, look at\nyourself in the glass; and you will find your soul gone out of you at\nyour face, and nothing left but an animal--and a bad, a villainous bad\nanimal too!\n\n\"You ask what my silence means?\" said Nugent.\n\nHe had only to model his articulation on his brother's slower manner of\nspeaking as distinguished from his own, to be his brother himself. In\nsaying those few first words, he did it so dexterously that I could have\nsworn--if I had not seen him standing before me--Oscar was in the room.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I ask that.\"\n\n\"I am silent,\" he answered, \"because I am waiting.\"\n\n\"What are you waiting for?\"\n\n\"To hear you make your apologies to Madame Pratolungo.\"\n\nShe started back a step. Submissive Oscar was taking a peremptory tone\nwith her for the first time in his life. Submissive Oscar, instead of\ngiving her time to speak, sternly went on.\n\n\"Madame Pratolungo has made her excuses to _you._ You ought to receive\nthem; you ought to reciprocate them. It is distressing to see you and\nhear you. You are behaving ungratefully to your best friend.\"\n\nShe raised her face, she raised her hands, in blank amazement: she looked\nas if she distrusted her own ears.\n\n\"Oscar!\" she exclaimed.\n\n\"Here I am,\" said Oscar, opening the door at the same moment.\n\nShe turned like lightning towards the place from which he had spoken. She\ndetected the deception which Nugent had practiced on her, with a cry of\nindignation that rang through the room.\n\nOscar ran to her in alarm. She thrust him back violently.\n\n\"A trick!\" she cried. \"A mean, vile, cowardly trick played upon my\nblindness! Oscar! your brother has been imitating you; your brother has\nbeen speaking to me in your voice. And that woman who calls herself my\nfriend--that woman stood by and heard him, and never told me. She\nencouraged it: she enjoyed it. The wretches! take me away from them. They\nare capable of any deceit. She always hated you, dear, from the\nfirst--she took up with your brother the moment he came here. When you\nmarry me, it mustn't be at Dimchurch; it must be in some place they don't\nknow of. There is a conspiracy between them against you and against me.\nBeware of them! beware of them! She said I should have fallen in love\nwith your brother, if I had met him first. There is a deeper meaning in\nthat, my love, than you can see. It means that they will part us if they\ncan. Ha! I hear somebody moving! Has he changed places with you? Is it\n_you_ whom I am speaking to now? Oh, my blindness! my blindness! Oh, God,\nof all your creatures, the most helpless, the most miserable, is the\ncreature who can't see!\"\n\nI never heard anything in all my life so pitiable and so dreadful as the\nfrantic suspicion and misery which tore their way out from her, in those\nwords. She cut me to the heart. I had spoken rashly--I had behaved\nbadly--but had I deserved this? No! no! no! I had _not_ deserved it. I\nthrew myself into a chair, and burst out crying. My tears scalded me; my\nsobs choked me. If I had had poison in my hand, I would have drunk it--I\nwas so furious and so wretched: so hurt in my honor, so wounded at my\nheart.\n\nThe only voice that answered her was Nugent's. Reckless what the\nconsequences might be--speaking, in his own proper person, from the\nopposite end of the room--he asked the all-important question which no\nhuman being had ever put to her yet.\n\n\"Are you sure, Lucilla, that you are blind for life?\"\n\nA dead silence followed the utterance of those words.\n\nI brushed away the tears from my eyes, and looked up.\n\nOscar had been--as I supposed--holding her in his arms, silently soothing\nher, when his brother spoke. At the moment when I saw her, she had just\ndetached herself from him. She advanced a step, towards the part of the\nroom in which Nugent stood--and stopped, with her face turned towards\nhim. Every faculty in her seemed to be suspended by the silent passage\ninto her mind of the new idea that he had called up. Through childhood,\ngirlhood, womanhood--never once, waking or dreaming, had the prospect of\nrestoration to sight presented itself within her range of contemplation,\nuntil now. Not a trace was left in her countenance of the indignation\nwhich Nugent had roused in her, hardly more than a moment since. Not a\nsign appeared indicating a return of the nervous suffering which the\nsense of his presence had inflicted on her, earlier in the day. The one\nemotion in possession of her was astonishment--astonishment that had\nstruck her dumb; astonishment that waited, helplessly and mechanically,\nto hear more.\n\nI observed Oscar, next. His eyes were fixed on Lucilla--absorbed in\nwatching her. He spoke to Nugent, without looking at him; animated, as it\nseemed, by a vague fear for Lucilla, which was slowly developing into a\nvague fear for himself.\n\n\"Mind what you are doing!\" he said. \"Look at her, Nugent--look at her.\"\n\nNugent approached his brother, circuitously, so as to place Oscar between\nLucilla and himself.\n\n\"Have I offended you?\" he asked.\n\nOscar looked at him in surprise. \"Offended with you,\" he answered, \"after\nwhat you have forgiven, and what you have suffered, for my sake?\"\n\n\"Still,\" persisted the other, \"there is something wrong.\"\n\n\"I am startled, Nugent.\"\n\n\"Startled--by what?\"\n\n\"By the question you have just put to Lucilla.\"\n\n\"You will understand me, and she will understand me, directly.\"\n\nWhile those words were passing between the brothers, my attention\nremained fixed on Lucilla. Her head had turned slowly towards the new\nposition which Nugent occupied when he spoke to Oscar. With this\nexception, no other movement had escaped her. No sense of what the two\nmen were saying to each other seemed to have entered her mind. To all\nappearance she had heard nothing, since Nugent had started the first\ndoubt in her whether she was blind for life.\n\n\"Speak to her,\" I said. \"For God's sake, don't keep her in suspense,\n_now!_\"\n\nNugent spoke.\n\n\"You have had reason to be offended with me, Lucilla. Let me, if I can,\ngive you reason to be grateful to me, before I have done. When I was in\nNew York, I became acquainted with a German surgeon, who had made a\nreputation and a fortune in America by his skill in treating diseases of\nthe eye. He had been especially successful in curing cases of blindness\ngiven up as hopeless by other surgeons. I mentioned your case to him. He\ncould say nothing positively (as a matter of course) without examining\nyou. All he could do was to place his services at my disposal, when he\ncame to England. I for one, Lucilla, decline to consider you blind for\nlife, until this skillful man sees no more hope for you than the English\nsurgeons have seen. If there is the faintest chance still left of\nrestoring your sight, his is, I firmly believe, the one hand that can do\nit. He is now in England. Say the word--and I will bring him to\nDimchurch.\"\n\nShe slowly lifted her hands to her head, and held it as if she was\nholding her reason in its place. Her color changed from pale to red--from\nred to pale once more. She drew a long, deep, heavy breath--and dropped\nher hands again, recovering from the shock. The change that followed,\nheld us all three breathless. It was beautiful to see her. It was awful\nto see her. A mute ecstasy of hope transfigured her face; a heavenly\nsmile played serenely on her lips. She was among us, and yet apart from\nus. In the still light of evening, shining in on her from the window, she\nstood absorbed in her own rapture--the silent creature of another sphere!\nThere was a moment when she overcame me with admiration, and another\nmoment when she overcame me with fear. Both the men felt it. Both signed\nto me to speak to her first.\n\nI advanced a few steps. I tried to consider with myself what I should\nsay. It was useless. I could neither think nor speak. I could only look\nat her. I could only say, nervously--\n\n\"Lucilla!\"\n\nShe came back to the world--she came back to _us_--with a little start,\nand a faint flush of color in her cheeks. She turned herself towards the\nplace from which I had spoken, and whispered----\n\n\"Come!\"\n\nIn a moment, my arms were round her. Her head sank on my bosom. We were\nreconciled without a word. We were friends again, sisters again, in an\ninstant.\n\n\"Have I been fainting? have I been sleeping?\" she said to me in low,\nbewildered tones. \"Am I just awake? Is this Browndown?\" She suddenly\nlifted her head. \"Nugent! are you there?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nShe gently withdrew herself from me, and approached Nugent.\n\n\"Did you speak to me just now? Was it you who put the doubt into my mind,\nwhether I am really doomed to be blind for life? Surely, I have not\nfancied it? Surely, you said the man was coming, and the time coming?\"\nHer voice suddenly rose. \"The man who may cure me! the time when I may\nsee!\"\n\n\"I said it, Lucilla. I meant it, Lucilla.\"\n\n\"Oscar! Oscar!! Oscar!!!\"\n\nI stepped forward to lead her to him. Nugent touched me, and pointed to\nOscar, as I took her hand. He was standing before the glass--with an\nexpression of despair which I see again while I write these lines--he was\nstanding close to the glass; looking in silence at the hideous reflection\nof his face. In sheer pity, I hesitated to take her to him. She stepped\nforward, and, stretching out her hand, touched his shoulder. The\nreflection of _her_ charming face appeared behind _his_ face in the\nglass. She raised herself on tiptoe, with both hands on him, and said,\n\"The time is coming, my darling, when I may see You!\"\n\nWith a cry of joy, she drew his face to her, and kissed him on the\nforehead. His head fell on his breast when she released it: he covered\nhis face with his hands, and stifled, for the moment, all outward\nexpression of the pang that wrung him. I drew her rapidly away, before\nher quick sensibilities had time to warn her that something was wrong.\nEven as it was, she resisted me. Even as it was, she asked suspiciously,\n\"Why do you take me away from him?\"\n\nWhat excuse could I make? I was at my wits' end.\n\nShe repeated the question. For once Fortune favored us. A timely knock at\nthe door stopped her just as she was trying to release herself from me.\n\"Somebody coming in,\" I said. The servant entered, as I spoke, with a\nletter from the rectory.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE TWENTY-NINTH\n\nParliamentary Summary\n\nOH, the welcome interruption! After the agitation that we had suffered,\nwe all stood equally in need of some such relief as this. It was\nabsolutely a luxury to fall back again into the common-place daily\nroutine of life. I asked to whom the letter was addressed? Nugent\nanswered, \"The letter is addressed to me; and the writer is Mr. Finch.\"\n\nHaving read the letter, he turned to Lucilla.\n\n\"I sent a message to your father, asking him to join us here,\" he said.\n\"Mr. Finch writes back to say that his duties keep him at home, and to\nsuggest that the rectory is the fitter place for the discussion of family\nmatters. Have you any objection to return to the house? And do you mind\ngoing on first with Madame Pratolungo?\"\n\nLucilla's quick suspicion was instantly aroused.\n\n\"Why not with Oscar?\" she asked.\n\n\"Your father's note suggests to me,\" replied Nugent, \"that he is a little\nhurt at the short notice I gave him of our discussion here. I thought--if\nyou and Madame Pratolungo went on first--that you might make our peace\nwith the rector, and assure him that we meant no disrespect, before Oscar\nand I appeared. Don't you think yourself you would make it easier for us,\nif you did that?\"\n\nHaving contrived in this dexterous way to separate Oscar and Lucilla, and\nto gain time for composing and fortifying his brother before they met\nagain, Nugent opened the door for us to go out. Lucilla and I left the\ntwins together, in the modest little room which had witnessed a scene\nalike memorable to all of us for its interest at the time, and for the\nresults which were to come of it in the future.\n\nHalf an hour later, we were all assembled at the rectory.\n\nOur adjourned debate--excepting one small suggestion emanating from\nmyself--was a debate which led to nothing. It may be truly described as\nresolving itself into the delivery of an Oration by Mr. Finch. Subject,\nthe assertion of Mr. Finch's dignity.\n\nOn this occasion (having matters of more importance on hand) I take the\nliberty of cutting the reverend gentleman's speech by the pattern of the\nreverend gentleman's stature. Short in figure, the rector shall be here,\nfor the first time in his life, short in language too.\n\nReverend Finch rose, and said--he objected to everything. To receiving a\nmessage on a card instead of a proper note. To being expected to present\nhimself at Browndown at a moment's notice. To being the last person\ninformed (instead of the first) of Mr. Nugent Dubourg's exaggerated and\nabsurd view of the case of his afflicted child. To the German surgeon, as\nbeing certainly a foreigner and a stranger, and possibly a quack. To the\nslur implied on British Surgery by bringing the foreigner to Dimchurch.\nTo the expense involved in the same proceeding. Finally to the whole\nscope and object of Mr. Nugent Dubourg's proposal, which had for its\norigin rebellion against the decrees of an all-wise Providence, and for\nits result the disturbance of his daughter's mind--\"under My influence,\nsir, a mind in a state of Christian resignation: under Your influence, a\nmind in a state of infidel revolt.\" With those concluding remarks, the\nreverend gentleman sat down--and paused for a reply.\n\nA remarkable result followed, which might be profitably permitted to take\nplace in some other Parliaments. Nobody replied.\n\nMr. Nugent Dubourg rose--no! sat--and said, he declined to take any part\nin the proceedings. He was quite ready to wait, until the end justified\nthe means which he proposed to employ. For the rest, his conscience was\nat ease; and he was entirely at Miss Finch's service.\n\nMr. Oscar Dubourg, sitting hidden from notice behind his brother,\nfollowed his brother's example. The decision in the matter under\ndiscussion rested with Miss Finch alone. He had no opinion of his own to\noffer on it.\n\nMiss Finch herself, appealed to next:--Had but one reply to give. With\nall possible respect for her father, she ventured to think that neither\nhe nor any one, possessing the sense of vision, could quite enter into\nher feelings as the circumstances then were. If there really was any\nchance of her recovering her sight, the least she could do would be to\ngive that chance a fair trial. She entreated Mr. Nugent Dubourg not to\nlose one unnecessary moment in bringing the German surgeon to Dimchurch.\n\nMrs. Finch, called upon next. Spoke after some little delay, caused by\nthe loss of her pocket-handkerchief. Would not presume to differ in\nopinion with her husband, whom she had never yet known to be otherwise\nthan perfectly right about everything. But, if the German surgeon _did_\ncome, and if Mr. Finch saw no objection to it, she would much like to\nconsult him (gratis, if possible) on the subject of \"baby's eyes.\" Mrs.\nFinch was proceeding to explain that there was happily nothing the\nmatter, that she could see, with the infant's eyes at that particular\nmoment, and that she merely wished to take a skilled medical opinion, in\nthe event of something happening on some future occasion--when she was\ncalled to order by Mr. Finch. The reverend gentleman, at the same time,\nappealed to Madame Pratolungo to close the debate by giving frank\nexpression to her own opinion.\n\nMadame Pratolungo, speaking in conclusion, remarked:--\n\nThat the question of consulting the German surgeon appeared (after what\nhad fallen from Miss Finch) to be a question which had passed beyond the\nrange of any expression of feeling on the part of other persons. That she\nproposed, accordingly, to look, beyond the consultation, at the results\nwhich might follow it. That, contemplating these possible results, she\nheld very strong views of her own, and would proceed to give frank\nexpression to them as follows. That in her opinion, the proposed\ninvestigation of the chances which might exist of restoring Miss Finch's\nsight, involved consequences far too serious to be trusted to the\ndecision of any one man, no matter how skillful or how famous he might\nbe. That, in pursuance of this view, she begged to suggest (1) the\nassociation of an eminent English oculist with the eminent German\noculist; (2) an examination of Miss Finch's case by both the professional\ngentlemen, consulting on it together; and (3) a full statement of the\nopinions at which they might respectively arrive, to be laid before the\nmeeting now assembled, and to become the subject of a renewed discussion\nbefore any decisive measures were taken.\n\nLastly, that this proposal be now submitted, in the form of a resolution,\nand forthwith (if necessary) put to the vote.\n\nResolution, as above, put to the vote.\n\nMajority--Ayes.\n\nMiss Finch. Mr. Nugent Dubourg. Mr. Oscar Dubourg. Madame Pratolungo.\n\nMinority--Noes.\n\nNo (on the score of expense), Mr. Finch. No (because Mr. F. says No),\nMrs. Finch.\n\nResolution carried by a majority of two. Debate adjourned to a day to be\nhereafter decided on.\n\nBy the first train the next morning, Nugent Dubourg started for London.\n\nAt luncheon, the same day, a telegram arrived, reporting his proceedings\nin the following terms:--\n\n\"I have seen my friend. He is at our service. He is also quite willing to\nconsult with any English oculist whom we may choose. I am just off to\nfind the man. Expect a second telegram later in the day.\"\n\nThe second telegram reached us in the evening, and ran thus:--\n\n\"Everything is settled. The German oculist and the English oculist leave\nLondon with me, by the twelve-forty train to-morrow afternoon.\"\n\nAfter reading this telegram to Lucilla, I sent it to Oscar at Browndown.\nJudge for yourself how he slept, and how we slept, that night!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRTIETH\n\nHerr Grosse\n\nSEVERAL circumstances deserving to be mentioned here, took place in the\nearly part of the day on which we expected the visit of the two oculists.\nI have all the will to relate them--but the capacity to do it completely\nfails me.\n\nWhen I look back at that eventful morning, I recall a scene of confusion\nand suspense, the bare recollection of which seems to upset my mind\nagain, even at this distance of time. Things and persons all blend\ndistractedly one with another. I see the charming figure of my blind\nLucilla, robed in rose-color and white, flitting hither and thither, in\nthe house and out of the house--at one time mad with impatience for the\narrival of the surgeons; at another, shuddering with apprehension of the\ncoming ordeal, and the coming disappointment which might follow. A moment\nmore--and, just as my mind has seized it, the fair figure melts and\nmerges into the miserable apparition of Oscar; hovering and hesitating\nbetween Browndown and the rectory; painfully conscious of the new\ncomplications introduced into his position towards Lucilla by the new\nstate of things; and yet not man enough, even yet, to seize the\nopportunity, and set himself right. Another moment passes, and a new\nfigure--a little strutting consequential figure forces its way into the\nforeground, before I am ready for it. I hear a big voice booming in my\near, with big language to correspond. \"No, Madame Pratolungo, nothing\nwill induce me to sanction by my presence this insane medical\nconsultation, this extravagant and profane attempt to reverse the decrees\nof an all-wise Providence by purely human means. My foot is down--I use\nthe language of the people, observe, to impress it the more strongly on\nyour mind--My FOOT is down!\" Another moment yet, and Finch and Finch's\nFoot disappear over my mental horizon just as my eye has caught them.\nDamp Mrs. Finch, and the baby whose everlasting programme is suction and\nsleep, take the vacant place. Mrs. Finch pledges me with watery\nearnestness to secrecy; and then confides her intention of escaping her\nhusband's supervision if she can, and bringing British surgery and German\nsurgery to bear both together (gratis) on baby's eyes. Conceive these\npersons all twisting and turning in the convolutions of my brains, as if\nthose brains were a labyrinth; with the sayings and doings of one,\nconfusing themselves with the sayings and doings of the other--with a\nthin stream of my own private anxieties (comprehending luncheon on a\nside-table for the doctors) trickling at intervals through it all--and\nyou will not wonder if I take a jump, like a sheep, over some six hours\nof precious time, and present my solitary self to your eye, posted alone\nin the sitting-room to receive the council of surgeons on its arrival at\nthe house. I had but two consolations to sustain me.\n\nFirst, a Mayonnaise of chicken of my own making on the luncheon-table,\nwhich, as a work of Art, was simply adorable--I say no more. Secondly, my\ngreen silk dress, trimmed with my mother's famous lace--another work of\nArt, equally adorable with the first. Whether I looked at the\nluncheon-table, or whether I looked in the glass, I could feel that I\nworthily asserted my nation; I could say to myself, Even in this remote\ncorner of the earth, the pilgrim of civilization searching for the\nelegant luxuries of life, looks and sees--France supreme!\n\n\n\nThe clock chimed the quarter past three. Lucilla, wearying, for the\nhundredth time of waiting in her own room, put her head in at the door,\nand still repeated the never-changing question--\"No signs of them yet?\"\n\n\"None, my love.\"\n\n\"Oh, how much longer will they keep us waiting!\"\n\n\"Patience, Lucilla--patience!\"\n\nShe disappeared again, with a weary sigh. Five minutes more passed; and\nold Zillah peeped into the room next.\n\n\"Here they are, ma'am, in a chaise at the gate!\"\n\nI shook out the skirts of my green silk, I cast a last inspiriting glance\nat the Mayonnaise. Nugent's cheerful voice reached me from the garden,\nconducting the strangers. \"This way, gentlemen--follow me.\" A pause.\nSteps outside. The door opened. Nugent brought them in.\n\nHerr Grosse, from America. Mr. Sebright of London.\n\nThe German gave a little start when my name was mentioned. The Englishman\nremained perfectly unaffected by it. Herr Grosse had heard of my glorious\nPratolungo. Mr. Sebright was barbarously ignorant of his existence. I\nshall describe Herr Grosse first, and shall take the greatest pains with\nhim.\n\nA squat, broad, sturdy body, waddling on a pair of short bandy legs;\nslovenly, shabby, unbrushed clothes; a big square bilious-yellow face,\nsurmounted by a mop of thick iron-grey hair; dark beetle-brows; a pair of\nstaring, fierce, black, goggle eyes, with huge circular spectacles\nstanding up like fortifications in front of them; a shaggy beard and\nmustache of mixed black, white, and grey; a prodigious cameo ring on the\nforefinger of one hairy hand; the other hand always in and out of a deep\nsilver snuff-box like a small tea-caddy; a rough rasping voice; a\ndiabolically humourous smile; a curtly confident way of speaking;\nresolution, independence, power, expressed all over him from head to\nfoot--there is the portrait of the man who held in his hands (if Nugent\nwas to be trusted) the restoration of Lucilla's sight!\n\nThe English oculist was as unlike his German colleague as it is possible\nfor one human being to be to another.\n\nMr. Sebright was slim and spare, and scrupulously (painfully) clean and\nneat. His smooth light hair was carefully parted; his well-shaved face\nexhibited two little crisp morsels of whisker about two inches long, and\nno hair more. His decent black clothes were perfectly made; he wore no\nornaments, not even a watch-chain; he moved deliberately, he spoke\ngravely and quietly; disciplined attention looked coldly at you out of\nhis light grey eyes; and said, Here I am if you want me, in every\nmovement of his thin finely-cut lips. A thoroughly capable man, beyond\nall doubt--but defend me from accidentally sitting next to him at dinner,\nor traveling with him for my only companion on a long journey!\n\nI received these distinguished persons with my best grace. Herr Grosse\ncomplimented me in return on my illustrious name, and shook hands. Mr.\nSebright said it was a beautiful day, and bowed. The German, the moment\nhe was at liberty to look about him, looked at the luncheon-table. The\nEnglishman looked out of window.\n\n\"Will you take some refreshment, gentlemen?\"\n\nHerr Grosse nodded his shock head in high approval. His wild eyes glared\ngreedily at the Mayonnaise through his prodigious spectacles. \"Aha! I\nlike that,\" said the illustrious surgeon, pointing at the dish with his\nringed forefinger. \"You know how to make him--you make him with creams.\nIs he chickens or lobsters? I like lobsters best, but chickens is goot\ntoo. The garnish is lofely--anchovy, olive, beetroots; brown, green, red,\non a fat white sauce! This I call a heavenly dish. He is nice-cool in two\ndifferent ways; nice-cool, to the eye, nice-cool to the taste! Soh! we\nwill break into his inside. Madame Pratolungo, you shall begin. Here goes\nfor the liver-wings!\"\n\nIn this extraordinary English--turning words in the singular into words\nin the plural, and banishing from the British vocabulary the copulative\nconjunction \"and\"--Herr Grosse announced his readiness to sit down to\nlunch. He was politely recalled from the Mayonnaise to the patient by his\ndiscreet English colleague.\n\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. Sebright. \"Would it not be advisable to see\nthe young lady, before we do anything else? I am obliged to return to\nLondon by the next train.\"\n\nHerr Grosse-with a fork in one hand and a spoon in the other, and a\nnapkin tied round his neck--stared piteously; shook his shock head; and\nturned his back on the Mayonnaise, with a heavy heart at parting.\n\n\"Goot. We shall do our works first: then eat our lunches afterwards.\nWhere is the patients? Come-begin-begin!\" He removed the napkin, blew a\nsigh (there is no other way of expressing it)--and plunged his finger and\nthumb into his tea-caddy snuff-box. \"Where is the patients?\" he repeated\nirritably. \"Why is she not close-handy in here?\"\n\n\"She is waiting in the next room,\" I said. \"I will bring her in directly.\nYou will make allowances for her, gentlemen, I am sure, if you find her a\nlittle nervous?\" I added, looking at both the oculists. Silent Mr.\nSebright bowed. Herr Grosse grinned diabolically, and said, \"Make your\nmind easy, my goot creature. I am not such a brutes as I look!\"\n\n\"Where is Oscar?\" asked Nugent, as I passed him on my way to Lucilla's\nroom.\n\n\"After altering his mind a dozen times at least,\" I replied, \"he has\ndecided on not being present at the examination.\"\n\nI had barely said the words before the door opened, and Oscar entered the\nroom. He had altered his mind for the thirteenth time--and here he was as\nthe result of it!\n\nHerr Grosse burst out with an exclamation in his own language, at the\nsight of Oscar's face. \"Ach, Gott!\" he exclaimed, \"he has been taking\nNitrates of Silvers. His complexions is spoilt. Poor boys! poor boys!\" He\nshook his shaggy head--turned--and spat compassionately into a corner of\nthe room. Oscar looked offended; Mr. Sebright looked disgusted; Nugent\nthoroughly enjoyed it. I left the room and closed the door behind me.\n\nI had not taken two steps in the corridor when I heard the door opened\nagain. Looking back directly, I found myself, to my amazement, face to\nface with Herr Grosse--staring ferociously at me through his spectacles,\nand offering me his arm!\n\n\"Hosh!\" said the famous oculist in a heavy whisper. \"Say nothing to\nnobody. I am come to help you.\"\n\n\"To help me?\" I repeated.\n\nHerr Grosse nodded vehemently--so vehemently that his prodigious\nspectacles hopped up and down on his nose.\n\n\"What did you tell me just now?\" he asked. \"You told me the patient was\nnervous. Goot! I am come to go with you to the patients, and help you to\nfetch her. Soh! soh! I am not such a brutes as I look. Come-begin-begin!\nWhere is she?\"\n\nI hesitated for a moment about introducing this remarkable ambassador\ninto Lucilla's bedroom. One look at him decided me. After all, he was a\ndoctor,--and such an ugly one! I took his arm.\n\nWe went together into Lucilla's room. She started up from the sofa on\nwhich she was reclining when she heard the strange footsteps entering,\nside by side with mine.\n\n\"Who is it?\" she cried.\n\n\"It is me, my dears,\" said Herr Grosse. \"Ach, Gott! what a pretty girls!\nHere is jost the complexions I like-nice-fair! nice-fair! I am come to\nsee what I can do, my pretty Miss, for this eyes of yours. If I can let\nthe light in on you--hey! you will lofe me, won't you? You will kees even\nan ugly Germans like me. Soh! Come under my arm. We will go back into the\nodder rooms. There is anodder one waiting to let the light in too--Mr.\nSebrights. Two surgeon-optic to one pretty Miss--English surgeon-optic;\nGerman surgeon-optic--hey! between us we shall cure this nice girls.\nMadame Pratolungo, here is my odder arms at your service. Hey! what? You\nlook at my coatsleeve. He is shabby-greasy--I am ashamed of him. No\nmatter. You have got Mr. Sebrights to look at in the odder rooms. He is\nspick-span, beautiful-new. Come! Forwards! Marsch!\"\n\nNugent, waiting in the corridor, threw the door open for us. \"Isn't he\ndelightful?\" Nugent whispered behind me, pointing to his friend. Escorted\nby Herr Grosse, we made a magnificent entry into the room. Our German\ndoctor had done Lucilla good already. The examination was relieved of all\nits embarrassments and its terrors at the outset. Herr Grosse had made\nher laugh--Herr Grosse had set her completely at her ease.\n\nMr. Sebright and Oscar were talking together in a perfectly friendly way\nwhen we returned to the sitting-room. The reserved Englishman appeared to\nhave his attraction for the shy Oscar. Even Mr. Sebright was struck by\nLucilla; his cold face lit up with interest when he was presented to her.\nHe placed a chair for her in front of the window. There was a warmth in\nhis tone which I had not heard yet, when he begged her to be seated in\nthat place. She took the chair. Mr. Sebright thereupon drew back, and\nbowed to Herr Grosse, with a courteous wave of his hand towards Lucilla\nwhich signified, \"You first!\"\n\nHerr Grosse met this advance with a counter-wave of the hand, and a\nvehement shake of his shock-head, which signified, \"I couldn't think of\nsuch a thing!\"\n\n\"Pardon me,\" entreated Mr. Sebright. \"As my senior, as a visitor to\nEngland, as a master in our art.\"\n\nHerr Grosse responded by regaling himself with three pinches of snuff in\nrapid succession--a pinch as senior, a pinch as visitor to England, a\npinch as master in the art. An awful pause followed. Neither of the\nsurgeons would take precedence of the other. Nugent interfered.\n\n\"Miss Finch is waiting,\" he said. \"Come, Grosse, you were first presented\nto her. You examine her first.\"\n\nHerr Grosse took Nugent's ear between his finger and thumb, and gave it a\ngood-humoured pinch. \"You clever boys!\" he said. \"You have the right word\nalways at the tips of your tongue.\" He waddled to Lucilla's chair; and\nstopped short with a scandalized look. Oscar was bending over her, and\nwhispering to her with her hand in his. \"Hey! what?\" cried Herr Grosse.\n\"Is this a third surgeon-optic? What, sir! you treat young Miss's eyes by\ntaking hold of young Miss's hand? You are a Quack. Get out!\" Oscar\nwithdrew--not very graciously. Herr Grosse took a chair in front of\nLucilla, and removed his spectacles. As a short-sighted man, he had\nnecessarily excellent eyes for all objects which were sufficiently near\nto him. He bent forward, with his face close to Lucilla's, and parted her\neyelids alternately with his finger and thumb; peering attentively, first\ninto one eye, then into the other.\n\nIt was a moment of breathless interest. Who could say what an influence\non her future life might be exercised by this quaint kindly uncouth\nlittle foreign man? How anxiously we watched those shaggy eyebrows, those\npiercing goggle eyes! And, oh, heavens, how disappointed we were at the\nfirst result! Lucilla suddenly gave a little irrepressible shudder of\ndisgust. Herr Grosse drew back from her, and glared at her benignantly\nwith his diabolical smile.\n\n\"Aha!\" he said. \"I see what it is. I snuff, I smoke, I reek of tobaccos.\nThe pretty Miss smells me. She says in her inmost heart--Ach Gott, how he\nstink!\"\n\nLucilla burst into a fit of laughter. Herr Grosse, unaffectedly amused on\nhis side, grinned with delight, and snatched her handkerchief out of her\napron-pocket. \"Gif me scents,\" said this excellent German. \"I shall stop\nup her nose with her handkerchiefs. So she will not smell my\ntobacco-stinks--all will be nice-right again--we shall go on.\" I gave him\nsome lavender-water from a scent-bottle on the table. He gravely drenched\nthe handkerchief with it, and popped it suddenly on Lucilla's nose. \"Hold\nhim there, Miss. You cannot for the life of you smell Grosse now. Goot!\nWe may go on again.\"\n\nHe took a magnifying glass out of his waistcoat pocket, and waited till\nLucilla had fairly exhausted herself with laughing. Then the\nexamination--so cruelly grotesque in itself, so terribly serious in the\nissues which it involved--resumed its course: Herr Grosse glaring at his\npatient through his magnifying glass; Lucilla leaning back in the chair,\nholding the handkerchief over her nose.\n\nA minute, or more, passed--and the ordeal of the examination came to an\nend.\n\nHerr Grosse put back his magnifying glass with a grunt which sounded like\na grunt of relief, and snatched the handkerchief away from Lucilla.\n\n\"Ach! what a nasty smell!\" he said, holding the handkerchief to his nose\nwith a grimace of disgust. \"Tobaccos is much better than this.\" He\nsolaced his nostrils, offended by the lavender-water, with a huge pinch\nof snuff. \"Now I am going to talk,\" he went on. \"See! I keep my distance.\nYou don't want your handkerchiefs--you smell me no more.\"\n\n\"Am I blind for life?\" said Lucilla. \"Pray, pray tell me, sir! Am I blind\nfor life?\"\n\n\"Will you kees me if I tell you?\"\n\n\"Oh, do consider how anxious I am! Pray, pray, pray tell me!\"\n\nShe tried to go down on her knees before him. He held her back firmly and\nkindly in her chair.\n\n\"Now! now! now! you be nice-goot, and tell me this first. When you are\nout in the garden, taking your little lazy lady's walks on a shiny-sunny\nday, is it all the same to your eyes as if you were lying in your bed in\nthe middles of the night?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Hah! You know it is nice-light at one time? you know it is horrid-dark\nat the odder?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Then why you ask me if you are blind for life? If you can see as much as\nthat, you are not properly blind at all?\"\n\nShe clasped her hands, with a low cry of delight. \"Oh, where is Oscar?\"\nshe said softly. \"Where is Oscar?\" I looked round for him. He was gone.\nWhile his brother and I had been hanging spell-bound over the surgeon's\nquestions and the patient's answers, he must have stolen silently out of\nthe room.\n\nHerr Grosse rose, and vacated the chair in favor of Mr. Sebright. In the\necstasy of the new hope now confirmed in her, Lucilla seemed to be\nunconscious of the presence of the English oculist, when he took his\ncolleague's place. His grave face looked more serious than ever, as he\ntoo produced a magnifying glass from his pocket, and, gently parting the\npatient's eyelids, entered on the examination of her blindness, in his\nturn.\n\nThe investigation by Mr. Sebright lasted a much longer time than the\ninvestigation by Herr Grosse. He pursued it in perfect silence. When he\nhad done he rose without a word, and left Lucilla as he had found her,\nrapt in the trance of her own happiness--thinking, thinking, thinking of\nthe time when she should open her eyes in the new morning, and see!\n\n\"Well?\" said Nugent, impatiently addressing Mr. Sebright. \"What do you\nsay?\"\n\n\"I say nothing yet.\" With that implied reproof to Nugent, he turned to\nme. \"I understand that Miss Finch was blind--or as nearly blind as could\nbe discovered--at a year old?\"\n\n\"I have always heard so,\" I replied.\n\n\"Is there any person in the house--parent, or relative, or servant--who\ncan speak to the symptoms noticed when she was an infant?\"\n\nI rang the bell for Zillah. \"Her mother is dead,\" I said. \"And there are\nreasons which prevent her father from being present to-day. Her old nurse\nwill be able to give you all the information you want.\"\n\nZillah appeared. Mr. Sebright put his questions.\n\n\"Were you in the house when Miss Finch was born?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Was there anything wrong with her eyes at her birth, or soon\nafterwards?\"\n\n\"Nothing, sir.\"\n\n\"How did you know?\"\n\n\"I knew by seeing her take notice, sir. She used to stare at the candles,\nand clutch at things that were held before her, as other babies do.\"\n\n\"How did you discover it, when she began to get blind?\"\n\n\"In the same way, sir. There came a time, poor little thing, when her\neyes looked glazed-like, and try her as we might, morning or evening, it\nwas all the same--she noticed nothing.\"\n\n\"Did the blindness come on gradually?\"\n\n\"Yes, sir--bit by bit, as you may say. Slowly worse and worse one week\nafter another. She was a little better than a year old before we clearly\nmade it out that her sight was gone.\"\n\n\"Was her father's sight, or her mother's sight ever affected in any way?\"\n\n\"Never, sir, that I heard of.\"\n\nMr. Sebright turned to Herr Grosse, sitting at the luncheon-table\nresignedly contemplating the Mayonnaise. \"Do you wish to ask the nurse\nany questions?\" he said.\n\nHerr Grosse shrugged his shoulders, and pointed backwards with his thumb\nat the place in which Lucilla was sitting.\n\n\"Her case is as plain to me as twos and twos make fours. Ach Gott! what\ndo I want with the nurse?\" He turned again longingly towards the\nMayonnaise. \"My fine appetites is going! When shall we lonch?\"\n\nMr. Sebright dismissed Zillah with a frigid inclination of the head. His\ndiscouraging manner made me begin to feel a little uneasy. I ventured to\nask if he had arrived at a conclusion yet. \"Permit me to consult with my\ncolleague before I answer you,\" said the impenetrable man. I roused\nLucilla. She again inquired for Oscar. I said I supposed we should find\nhim in the garden--and so took her out. Nugent followed us. I heard Herr\nGrosse whisper to him piteously, as we passed the luncheon-table, \"For\nthe lofe of Heaven, come back soon, and let us lonch!\" We left the\nill-assorted pair to their consultation in the sitting-room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIRST\n\n\"Who Shall Decide when Doctors disagree?\"\n\nWE had certainly not been more than ten minutes in the garden, when we\nwere startled by an extraordinary outbreak of shouting in broken English,\nproceeding from the window of the sitting-room. \"Hi-hi-hoi! hoi-hi!\nhoi-hi!\" We looked up, and discovered Herr Grosse, frantically waving a\nhuge red silk handkerchief at the window. \"Lonch! lonch!\" cried the\nGerman surgeon. \"The consultations is done. Come begin-begin.\"\n\nObedient to this peremptory summons, Lucilla, Nugent, and I returned to\nthe sitting-room. We had, as I had foreseen, found Oscar wandering alone\nin the garden. He had entreated me, by a sign, not to reveal our\ndiscovery of him to Lucilla, and had hurried away to hide himself in one\nof the side-walks. His agitation was pitiable to see. He was totally\nunfit to be trusted in Lucilla's presence at that anxious moment.\n\nWhen we had left the oculists together, I had sent Zillah with a little\nwritten message to Reverend Finch; entreating him (if it was only for\nform's sake) to reconsider his resolution, and be present on the\nall-important occasion to his daughter of the delivery of the medical\nopinions on her case. At the bottom of the stairs (on our return), my\nanswer was handed to me on a slip of sermon-paper. \"Mr. Finch declined to\nsubmit a question of principle to any considerations dictated by mere\nexpediency. He desired seriously to remind Madame Pratolungo of what he\nhad already told her. In other words, he would repeat, and he would beg\nher to remember this time, that his Foot was down.\"\n\nOn re-entering the room, we found the eminent oculists seated as far\napart as possible one from the other. Both gentlemen were engaged in\nreading. Mr. Sebright was reading a book. Herr Grosse was reading the\nMayonnaise.\n\nI placed Lucilla close by me, and took her hand. It was as cold as ice.\nMy poor dear trembled pitiably. For her, what moments of unutterable\nsuffering were those moments of suspense, before the surgeons delivered\ntheir sentence! I pressed her little cold hand in mine, and whispered\n\"Courage!\" Truly I can say it (though I am not usually one of the\nsentimental sort), my heart bled for her.\n\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" said Nugent, \"what is the result? Are you both\nagreed?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Sebright, putting aside his book.\n\n\"No,\" said Herr Grosse, ogling the Mayonnaise. Lucilla turned her face\ntowards me; her color shifting and changing, her bosom rising and falling\nmore and more rapidly. I whispered to her to compose herself. \"One of\nthem, at any rate,\" I said, \"thinks you will recover your sight.\" She\nunderstood me, and became quieter directly. Nugent went on with his\nquestions, addressed to the two oculists.\n\n\"What do you differ about?\" he asked. \"Will you let us hear your\nopinions?\"\n\nThe wearisome contest of courtesy was renewed between our medical\nadvisers. Mr. Sebright bowed to Herr Grosse:\n\n\"You first.\" Herr Grosse bowed to Mr. Sebright: \"No--you!\" My impatience\nbroke through this cruel and ridiculous professional restraint. \"Speak\nboth together, gentlemen, if you like!\" I said sharply. \"Do anything, for\nGod's sake, but keep us in suspense. Is it, or is it not, possible to\nrestore her sight?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Herr Grosse.\n\nLucilla sprang to her feet, with a cry of joy.\n\n\"No,\" said Mr. Sebright.\n\nLucilla dropped back again into her chair, and silently laid her head on\nmy shoulder.\n\n\"Are you agreed about the cause of her blindness?\" asked Nugent.\n\n\"Cataracts is the cause,\" answered Herr Grosse.\n\n\"So far, I agree,\" said Mr. Sebright. \"Cataract is the cause.\n\n\"Cataracts is curable,\" pursued the German.\n\n\"I agree again,\" continued the Englishman--\"with a reservation. Cataract\nis _sometimes_ curable.\"\n\n\"This cataracts is curable!\" cried Herr Grosse.\n\n\"With all possible deference,\" said Mr. Sebright, \"I dispute that\nconclusion. The cataract, in Miss Finch's case, is _not_ curable.\"\n\n\"Can you give us your reasons, sir, for saying that?\" I inquired.\n\n\"My reasons are based on surgical considerations which it requires a\nprofessional training to understand,\" Mr. Sebright replied. \"I can only\ntell you that I am convinced--after the most minute and careful\nexamination--that Miss Finch's sight is irrevocably gone. Any attempt to\nrestore it by an operation, would be, in my opinion, an unwarrantable\nproceeding. The young lady would not only have the operation to undergo,\nshe would be kept secluded afterwards, for at least six weeks or two\nmonths, in a darkened room. During that time, it is needless for me to\nremind you that she would inevitably form the most confident hope of her\nrestoration to sight. Remembering this, and believing as I do that the\nsacrifice demanded of her would end in failure, I think it most\nundesirable to expose our patient to the moral consequences of a\ndisappointment which must seriously try her. She has been resigned from\nchildhood to her blindness. As an honest man, who feels bound to speak\nout and to speak strongly, I advise you not further to disturb that\nresignation. I declare it to be, in my opinion, certainly useless, and\npossibly dangerous, to allow her to be operated on for the restoration of\nher sight.\"\n\nIn those uncompromising words, the Englishman delivered his opinion.\n\nLucilla's hand closed fast on mine. \"Cruel! cruel!\" she whispered to\nherself angrily. I gave her a little squeeze, recommending patience--and\nlooked in silent expectation (just as Nugent was looking too) at Herr\nGrosse. The German rose deliberately to his feet, and waddled to the\nplace in which Lucilla and I were sitting together.\n\n\"Has goot Mr. Sebrights done?\" he asked.\n\nMr. Sebright only replied by his everlasting never-changing bow.\n\n\"Goot! I have now my own word to put in,\" said Herr Grosse. \"It shall be\none little word--no more. With my best compliments to Mr. Sebrights, I\nset up against what he only thinks, what I--Grosse--with these hands of\nmine have done. The cataracts of Miss there, is a cataracts that I have\ncut into before, a cataracts that I have cured before. Now look!\" He\nsuddenly wheeled round to Lucilla, tucked up his cuffs, laid a forefinger\nof each hand on either side of her forehead, and softly turned down her\neyelids with his two big thumbs. \"I pledge you my word as surgeon-optic,\"\nhe resumed, \"my knife shall let the light in here. This lofable-nice\ngirls shall be more lofable-nicer than ever. My pretty Feench must be\nfirst in her best goot health. She must next gif me my own ways with\nher--and then one, two, three--ping! my pretty Feench shall see!\" He\nlifted Lucilla's eyelids again as he said the last word--glared fiercely\nat her through his spectacles--gave her the loudest kiss, on the\nforehead, that I ever heard given in my life--laughed till the room rang\nagain--and returned to his post as sentinel on guard over the Mayonnaise.\n\"Now,\" cried Herr Grosse cheerfully, \"the talkings is all done. Gott be\nthanked, the eatings may begin!\"\n\nLucilla left her chair for the second time.\n\n\"Herr Grosse,\" she said, \"where are you?\"\n\n\"Here, my dears!\"\n\nShe crossed the room to the table at which he was sitting, already\noccupied in carving his favorite dish.\n\n\"Did you say you must use a knife to make me see?\" she asked quite\ncalmly.\n\n\"Yes, yes. Don't you be frightened of that. Not much pains to bear--not\nmuch pains.\"\n\nShe tapped him smartly on the shoulder with her hand.\n\n\"Get up, Herr Grosse,\" she said. \"If you have your knife about you, here\nam I--do it at once!\"\n\nNugent started. Mr. Sebright started. Her daring amazed them both. As for\nme, I am the greatest coward living, in the matter of surgical operations\nperformed on myself or on others. Lucilla terrified me. I ran headlong\nacross the room to her. I was even fool enough to scream.\n\nBefore I could reach her, Herr Grosse had risen, obedient to command,\nwith a choice morsel of chicken on the end of his fork. \"You charming\nlittle fools,\" he said, \"I don't cut into cataracts in such a hurry as\nthat. I perform but one operations on you to-day. It is this!\" He\nunceremoniously popped the morsel of chicken into Lucilla's mouth. \"Aha!\nBite him well. He is nice-goot! Now then! Sit down all of you. Lonch!\nlonch!\"\n\nHe was irresistible. We all sat down at table.\n\nThe rest of us ate. Herr Grosse gobbled. From Mayonnaise to marmalade\ntart. From marmalade tart back again to Mayonnaise. From Mayonnaise,\nforward again to ham sandwiches and blancmange; and then back once more\n(on the word of an honest woman) to Mayonnaise! His drinking was on the\nsame scale as his eating. Beer, wine, brandy--nothing came amiss to him;\nhe mixed them all. As for the lighter elements in the feast--the almonds\nand raisins, the preserved ginger and the crystallized fruits, he ate\nthem as accompaniments to everything. A dish of olives especially won his\nfavor. He plunged both hands into it, and deposited his fists-full of\nolives in the pockets of his trousers. \"In this ways,\" he explained, \"I\nshall trouble nobody to pass the dish--I shall have by me continually all\nthe olives that I want.\" When he could eat and drink no more, he rolled\nup his napkin into a ball, and became devoutly thankful. \"How goot of\nGott,\" he remarked, \"when he invented the worlds to invent eatings and\ndrinkings too! Ah!\" sighed Herr Grosse, gently laying his outspread\nfingers on the pit of his stomach, \"what immense happiness there is in\nThis!\"\n\nMr. Sebright looked at his watch.\n\n\"If there is anything more to be said on the question of the operation,\"\nhe announced, \"it must be said at once. We have barely five minutes more\nto spare. You have heard my opinion. I hold to it.\"\n\nHerr Grosse took a pinch of snuff. \"I also,\" he said, \"hold to mine.\"\n\nLucilla turned towards the place from which Mr. Sebright had spoken.\n\n\"I am obliged to you, sir, for your opinion,\" she said, very quietly and\nfirmly. \"I am determined to try the operation. If it does fail, it will\nonly leave me what I am now. If it succeeds, it gives me a new life. I\nwill bear anything, and risk anything, on the chance that I may see.\"\n\nSo, she announced her decision. In those memorable words, she cleared the\nway for the coming Event in her life and in our lives, which it is the\npurpose of these pages to record.\n\nMr. Sebright answered her, in Mr. Sebright's discreet way.\n\n\"I cannot affect to be surprised at your decision,\" he said. \"However\nsincerely I may regret it, I admit that it is the natural decision, in\nyour case.\"\n\nLucilla addressed herself next to Herr Grosse.\n\n\"Choose your own day,\" she said. \"The sooner, the better. To-morrow, if\nyou can.\"\n\n\"Answer me one little thing, Miss,\" rejoined the German, with a sudden\ngravity of tone and manner which was quite new in our experience of him.\n\"Do you mean what you say?\"\n\nShe answered him gravely on her side. \"I mean what I say.\"\n\n\"Goot. There is times, my lofe, to be funny. There is also times to be\ngrave. It is grave-times now. I have my last word to say to you before I\ngo.\"\n\nWith his wild black eyes staring through his owlish spectacles at\nLucilla's face, speaking earnestly in his strange broken English, he now\nimpressed on his patient the necessity of gravely considering, and\npreparing for, the operation which he had undertaken to perform.\n\nI was greatly relieved by the tone he took with her. He spoke with\nauthority: she would be obliged to listen to him.\n\nIn the first place, he warned Lucilla, if the operation failed, that\nthere would be no possibility of returning to it, and trying it again.\nOnce done, be the results what they might, it was done for good.\n\nIn the second place, before he would consent to operate, he must insist\non certain conditions, essential to success, being rigidly complied with,\non the part of the patient and her friends. Mr. Sebright had by no means\nexaggerated the length of the time of trial which would follow the\noperation, in the darkened room. Under no circumstances could she hope to\nhave her eyes uncovered, even for a few moments, to the light, after a\nshorter interval than six weeks. During the whole of that time, and\nprobably during another six weeks to follow, it was absolutely necessary\nthat she should be kept in such a state of health as would assist her,\nconstitutionally, in her gradual progress towards complete restoration of\nsight. If body and mind both were not preserved in their best and\nsteadiest condition, all that his skill could do might be done in vain.\nNothing to excite or to agitate her, must be allowed to find its way into\nthe quiet daily routine of her life, until her medical attendant was\nsatisfied that her sight was safe. The success of Herr Grosse's\nprofessional career had been due, in no small degree, to his rigid\nenforcement of these rules: founded on his own experience of the\ninfluence which a patient's general health, moral as well as physical,\nexercised on that patient's chance of profiting under an operation--more\nespecially under an operation on an organ so delicate as the organ of\nsight.\n\nHaving spoken to this effect, he appealed to Lucilla's own good sense to\nrecognize the necessity of taking time to consider her decision, and to\nconsult on it with relatives and friends. In plain words, for at least\nthree months the family arrangements must be so shaped, as to enable the\nsurgeon in attendance on her to hold the absolute power of regulating her\nlife, and of deciding on any changes introduced into it. When she and the\nmembers of her family circle were sure of being able to comply with these\nconditions, Lucilla had only to write to him at his hotel in London. On\nthe next day he would undertake to be at Dimchurch. And then and there\n(if he was satisfied with the state of her health at the time), he would\nperform the operation.\n\nAfter pledging himself in those terms, Herr Grosse puffed out his\nremaining breath in one deep guttural \"Hah!\"--and got briskly on his\nshort legs. At the same moment, Zillah knocked at the door, and announced\nthat the chaise was waiting for the two gentlemen at the rectory-gate.\n\nMr. Sebright rose--in some doubt, apparently, whether his colleague had\ndone talking. \"Don't let me hurry you,\" he said. \"I have business in\nLondon; and I must positively catch the next train.\"\n\n\"Soh! I have my business in London, too,\" answered his\nbrother-oculist--\"the business of pleasure.\" (Mr. Sebright looked\nscandalized at the frankness of this confession, coming from a\nprofessional man). \"I am so passion-fond of musics,\" Herr Grosse went\non--\"I want to be in goot times for the opera. Ach Gott! musics is\nexpensive in England! I climb to the gallery, and pay my five silver\nshillingses even there. For five copper pences, in my own country, I can\nget the same thing--only better done. From the deep bottoms of my heart,\"\nproceeded this curious man, taking a cordial leave of me, \"I thank you,\ndear madam, for the Mayonnaise. When I come again, I pray you more of\nthat lofely dish.\" He turned to Lucilla, and popped his thumb on her\neyelids for the last time at parting. \"My sweet-Feench, remember what\nyour surgeon-optic has said to you. I shall let the light in here--but in\nmy own way, at my own time. Pretty lofe! Ah, how infinitely much prettier\nshe will be, when she can see!\" He took Lucilla's hand, and put it\nsentimentally inside the collar of his waistcoat, over the region of the\nheart; laying his other hand upon it as if he was keeping it warm. In\nthis tender attitude, he blew a prodigious sigh; recovered himself, with\na shake of his shock-head; winked at me through his spectacles, and\nwaddled out after Mr. Sebright, who was already at the bottom of the\nstairs. Who would have guessed that this man held the key which was to\nopen for my blind Lucilla the gates of a new life!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-SECOND\n\nAlas for the Marriage!\n\nWE were left together; Nugent having accompanied the two oculists to the\ngarden-gate.\n\nNow that we were alone, Oscar's absence could hardly fail to attract\nLucilla's attention. Just as she was referring to him in terms which made\nit no easy task for me to quiet her successfully, we were interrupted by\nthe screams of the baby, ascending from the garden below. I ran to the\nwindow, and looked out.\n\nMrs. Finch had actually effected her desperate purpose of waylaying the\ntwo surgeons in the interests of \"baby's eyes.\" There she was, in a skirt\nand a shawl--with her novel dropped in one part of the lawn, and her\nhandkerchief in the other--pursuing the oculists on their way to the\nchaise. Reckless of appearances, Herr Grosse had taken to his heels. He\nwas retreating from the screeching infant (with his fingers stuffed into\nhis ears), as fast as his short legs would let him. Nugent was ahead of\nhim, hurrying on to open the garden-gate. Respectable Mr. Sebright\n(professionally incapable of running) brought up the rear. At short\nintervals, Mrs. Finch, close on his heels, held up the baby for\ninspection. At short intervals, Mr. Sebright held up his hands in polite\nprotest. Nugent, roaring with laughter, threw open the garden-gate. Herr\nGrosse rushed through the opening, and disappeared. Mr. Sebright followed\nHerr Grosse; and Mrs. Finch attempted to follow Mr. Sebright--when a new\npersonage appeared on the scene. Startled in the sanctuary of his study\nby the noise, the rector himself strutted into the garden, and brought\nhis wife to a sudden standstill, by inquiring in his deepest base notes,\n\"What does this unseemly disturbance mean?\"\n\nThe chaise drove off; and Nugent closed the garden-gate.\n\nSome words, inaudible to my ears, passed between Nugent and the\nrector--referring, as I could only suppose, to the visit of the two\ndeparting surgeons. After awhile, Mr. Finch turned away (to all\nappearance offended by something which had been said to him), and\naddressed himself to Oscar, who now reappeared on the lawn; having\nevidently only waited to show himself, until the chaise drove away. The\nrector paternally took his arm; and, beckoning to his wife with the other\nhand, took Mrs. Finch's arm next. Majestically marching back to the house\nbetween the two, Reverend Finch asserted himself and his authority\nalternately, now to Oscar and now to his wife. His big booming voice\nreached my ears distinctly, accompanied in sharp discord by the last\nwailings of the exhausted child.\n\nIn these terrible words the Pope of Dimchurch began:--\"Oscar! you are to\nunderstand distinctly, if you please, that I maintain my protest against\nthis impious attempt to meddle with my afflicted daughter's sight.--Mrs.\nFinch! _you_ are to understand that I excuse your unseemly pursuit of two\nstrange surgeons, in consideration of the state that I find you in at\nthis moment. After your last confinement but eight you became, I\nremember, hysterically irresponsible. Hold your tongue. You are\nhysterically irresponsible now.--Oscar! I decline, in justice to myself,\nto be present at any discussion which may follow the visit of those two\nprofessional persons. But I am not averse to advising you for your own\ngood. My Foot is down. Put your foot down too.--Mrs. Finch! how long is\nit since you ate last? Two hours? Are you sure it is two hours? Very\ngood. You require a sedative application. I order you, medically, to get\ninto a warm bath, and stay there till I come to you.--Oscar! you are\ndeficient, my good fellow, in moral weight. Endeavor to oppose yourself\nresolutely to any scheme, on the part of my unhappy daughter or of those\nwho advise her, which involves more expenditure of money in fees, and new\nappearances of professional persons.--Mrs. Finch! the temperature is to\nbe ninety-eight, and the position partially recumbent.--Oscar! I\nauthorize you (if you can't stop it in any other way) to throw My moral\nweight into the scale. You are free to say 'I oppose This, with Mr.\nFinch's approval: I am, so to speak, backed by Mr. Finch.'--Mrs. Finch! I\nwish you to understand the object of the bath. Hold your tongue. The\nobject is to produce a gentle action on your skin. One of the women is to\nkeep her eye on your forehead. The instant she perceives an appearance of\nmoisture, she is to run for me.--Oscar! you will let me know at what\ndecision they arrive, up-stairs in my daughter's room. Not after they\nhave merely heard what you have to say, but after My Moral Weight has\nbeen thrown into the scale.--Mrs. Finch! on leaving the bath, I shall\nhave you only lightly clothed. I forbid, with a view to your head, all\ncompression, whether of stays or strings, round the waist. I forbid\ngarters--with the same object. You will abstain from tea and talking. You\nwill lie, loose, on your back. You will----\"\n\nWhat else this unhappy woman was to do, I failed to hear. Mr. Finch\ndisappeared with her, round the corner of the house. Oscar waited at the\ndoor of our side of the rectory, until Nugent joined him, on their way\nback to the sitting-room in which we were expecting their return.\n\n\n\nAfter an interval of a few minutes, the brothers appeared.\n\nThroughout the whole of the time during which the surgeons had been in\nthe house, I had noticed that Nugent persisted in keeping himself\nscrupulously in the background. Having assumed the responsibility of\nputting the serious question of Lucilla's sight scientifically to the\ntest, he appeared to be resolved to pause there, and to interfere no\nfurther in the affair after it had passed its first stage. And now again,\nwhen we were met in our little committee to discuss, and possibly to\ncombat, Lucilla's resolution to proceed to extremities, he once more\nrefrained from interfering actively with the matter in hand.\n\n\"I have brought Oscar back with me,\" he said to Lucilla; \"and I have told\nhim how widely the two oculists differ in opinion on your case. He knows\nalso that you have decided on being guided by the more favorable view\ntaken by Herr Grosse--and he knows no more.\"\n\nThere he stopped abruptly and seated himself apart from us, at the lower\nend of the room.\n\nLucilla instantly appealed to Oscar to explain his conduct.\n\n\"Why have you kept out of the way?\" she asked. \"Why have you not been\nwith me, at the most important moment of my life?\"\n\n\"Because I felt your anxious position too keenly,\" Oscar answered. \"Don't\nthink me inconsiderate towards you, Lucilla. If I had not kept away, I\nmight not have been able to control myself.\"\n\nI thought that reply far too dexterous to have come from Oscar on the\nspur of the moment. Besides, he looked at his brother when he said the\nlast words. It seemed more than likely--short as the interval had been\nbefore they appeared in the sitting-room--that Nugent had been advising\nOscar, and had been telling him what to say.\n\nLucilla received his excuses with the readiest grace and kindness.\n\n\"Mr. Sebright tells me, Oscar, that my sight is hopelessly gone,\" she\nsaid. \"Herr Grosse answers for it that an operation will make me see.\nNeed I tell you which of the two I believe in? If I could have had my own\nway, Herr Grosse should have operated on my eyes, before he went back to\nLondon.\"\n\n\"Did he refuse?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nLucilla told him of the reasons which the German oculist had stated as\nunanswerable reasons for delay. Oscar listened attentively, and looked at\nhis brother again, before he replied.\n\n\"As I understand it,\" he said, \"if you decide on risking the operation at\nonce, you decide on undergoing six weeks' imprisonment in a darkened\nroom, and on placing yourself entirely at the surgeon's disposal for six\nweeks more, after that. Have you considered, Lucilla, that this means\nputting off our marriage again, for at least three months?\"\n\n\"If you were in my place, Oscar, you would let nothing, not even your\nmarriage, stand in the way of your restoration to sight. Don't ask me to\nconsider, love. I can consider nothing but the prospect of seeing You!\"\n\nThat fearlessly frank confession silenced him. He happened to be sitting\nopposite to the glass, so that he could see his face. The poor wretch\nabruptly moved his chair, so as to turn his back on it.\n\nI looked at Nugent, and surprised him trying to catch his brother's eye.\nPrompted by him, as I could now no longer doubt, Oscar had laid his\nfinger on a certain domestic difficulty which I had had in my mind, from\nthe moment when the question of the operation had been first agitated\namong us.\n\n(The marriage of Oscar and Lucilla--it is here necessary to explain--had\nencountered another obstacle, and undergone a new delay, in consequence\nof the dangerous illness of Lucilla's aunt. Miss Batchford, formally\ninvited to the ceremony as a matter of course, had most considerately\nsent a message begging that the marriage might not be deferred on her\naccount. Lucilla, however, had refused to allow her wedding to be\ncelebrated, while the woman who had been a second mother to her, lay at\nthe point of death. The rector having an eye to rich Miss Batchford's\nmoney--not for himself (Miss B. detested him), but for Lucilla--had\nsupported his daughter's decision; and Oscar had been compelled to\nsubmit. These domestic events had taken place about three weeks since;\nand we were now in receipt of news which not only assured us of the old\nlady's recovery, but informed us also that she would be well enough to\nmake one of the wedding party in a fortnight's time. The bride's dress\nwas in the house; the bride's father was ready to officiate--and here,\nlike a fatality, was the question of the operation unexpectedly starting\nup, and threatening another delay yet, for a period which could not\npossibly be shorter than a period of three months! Add to this, if you\nplease, a new element of embarrassment as follows. Supposing Lucilla to\npersist in her resolution, and Oscar to persist in concealing from her\nthe personal change in him produced by the medical treatment of the fits,\nwhat would happen? Nothing less than this. Lucilla, if the operation\nsucceeded, would find out for herself--before instead of after her\nmarriage--the deception that had been practiced on her. And how she might\nresent that deception, thus discovered, the cleverest person among us\ncould not pretend to foresee. There was our situation, as we sat in\ndomestic parliament assembled, when the surgeons had left us!)\n\nFinding it impossible to attract his brother's attention, Nugent had no\nalternative but to interfere actively for the first time.\n\n\"Let me suggest, Lucilla,\" he said, \"that it is your duty to look at the\nother side of the question, before you make up your mind. In the first\nplace, it is surely hard on Oscar to postpone the wedding-day again. In\nthe second place, clever as he is, Herr Grosse is not infallible. It is\njust possible that the operation may fail, and that you may find you have\nput off your marriage for three months, to no purpose. Do think of it! If\nyou defer the operation on your eyes till after your marriage, you\nconciliate all interests, and you only delay by a month or so the time\nwhen you may see.\"\n\nLucilla impatiently shook her head.\n\n\"If you were blind,\" she answered, \"you would not willingly delay by a\nsingle hour the time when you might see. You ask me to think of it. I ask\n_you_ to think of the years I have lost. I ask _you_ to think of the\nexquisite happiness I shall feel, when Oscar and I are standing at the\naltar, if I can _see_ the husband to whom I am giving myself for life!\nPut it off for a month? You might as well ask me to die for a month. It\nis like death to be sitting here blind, and to know that a man is within\na few hours' reach of me who can give me my sight! I tell you all\nplainly, if you go on opposing me in this, I don't answer for myself. If\nHerr Grosse is not recalled to Dimchurch before the end of the week--I am\nmy own mistress; I will go to him in London!\"\n\nBoth the brothers looked at me.\n\n\"Have you nothing to say, Madame Pratolungo?\" asked Nugent.\n\nOscar was too painfully agitated to speak. He softly crossed to my chair;\nand, kneeling by me, put my hand entreatingly to his lips.\n\nYou may consider me a heartless woman if you will. I remained entirely\nunmoved even by this. Lucilla's interests and my interests, you will\nobserve, were now one. I had resolved, from the first, that she should\nnot be married in ignorance of which was the man who was disfigured by\nthe blue face. If she took the course which would enable her to make that\ndiscovery for herself, at the right time, she would spare me the\nperformance of a very painful and ungracious duty--and she would marry,\nas I was determined she should marry, with a full knowledge of the truth.\nIn this position of affairs, it was no business of mine to join the\ntwin-brothers in trying to make her alter her resolution. On the\ncontrary, it was my business to confirm her in it.\n\n\"I can't see that I have any right to interfere,\" I said. \"In Lucilla's\nplace--after one and twenty years of blindness--I too should sacrifice\nevery other consideration to the consideration of recovering my sight.\"\n\nOscar instantly rose, offended with me, and walked away to the window.\nLucilla's face brightened gratefully. \"Ah!\" she said, \"_you_ understand\nme!\" Nugent, in his turn, left his chair. He had confidently calculated,\nin his brother's interests, on Lucilla's marriage preceding the recovery\nof Lucilla's sight. That calculation was completely baffled. The marriage\nwould now depend on the state of Lucilla's feelings, after she had\npenetrated the truth for herself. I saw Nugent's face darken, as he\nwalked to the door.\n\n\"Madame Pratolungo,\" he said, \"you may, one day, regret the course that\nyou have just taken. Do as you please, Lucilla--I have no more to say.\"\n\nHe left the room, with a quiet submission to circumstances which became\nhim admirably. Now, as always, it was impossible not to compare him\nadvantageously with his vacillating brother. Oscar turned round at the\nwindow, apparently with the idea of following Nugent out. At the first\nstep he checked himself. There was a last effort still left to make.\nReverend Finch's \"moral weight\" had not been thrown into the scale yet.\n\n\"There is one thing more, Lucilla,\" he said, \"which you ought to know\nbefore you decide. I have seen your father. He desires me to tell you\nthat he is strongly opposed to the experiment which you are determined to\ntry.\"\n\nLucilla sighed wearily. \"It is not the first time that I find my father\nfailing to sympathize with me,\" she said. \"I am distressed--but not\nsurprised. It is _you_ who surprise me!\" she added, suddenly raising her\nvoice. \"You, who love me, are not one with me, when I am standing on the\nbrink of a new life. Good Heavens! are my interests not your interests in\nthis? Is it not worth your while to wait till I can _look at you_ when I\nvow before God to love, honor, and obey you? Do you understand him?\" she\nasked, appealing abruptly to me. \"Why does he try to start difficulties?\nwhy is he not as eager about it as I am?\"\n\nI turned to Oscar. Now was the time for him to fall at her feet and own\nit! Here was the golden opportunity that might never come again. I signed\nto him impatiently to take it. He tried to take it--let me do him the\njustice now, which I failed to do him at the time--he tried to take it.\nHe advanced towards her; he struggled with himself; he said, \"There is a\nmotive for my conduct, Lucilla----\" and stopped. His breath failed him;\nhe struggled again; he forced out a word or two more: \"A motive,\" he went\non, \"which I have been afraid to confess----\" he paused again, with the\nperspiration pouring over his livid face.\n\nLucilla's patience failed her. \"What is your motive?\" she asked sharply.\n\nThe tone in which she spoke broke down his last reserves of resolution.\nHe turned his head suddenly so as not to see her. At the final\nmoment--miserable, miserable man!--at the final moment, he took refuge in\nan excuse.\n\n\"I don't believe in Herr Grosse,\" he said faintly, \"as you believe in\nhim.\"\n\nLucilla rose, bitterly disappointed, and opened the door that led into\nher own room.\n\n\"If it had been you who were blind,\" she answered, \"_your_ belief would\nhave been _my_ belief, and _your_ hope _my_ hope. It seems I have\nexpected too much from you. Live and learn! live and learn!\"\n\nShe went into her room, and closed the door on us. I could bear it no\nlonger. I got up, with the firm resolution in me to follow her, and say\nthe words which he had failed to say for himself. My hand was on the\ndoor, when I was suddenly pulled back from it by Oscar. I turned, and\nfaced him in silence.\n\n\"No!\" he said, with his eyes fixed on mine, and his hand still on my arm.\n\"If I don't tell her, nobody shall tell her for me.\"\n\n\"She shall be deceived no longer--she must, and shall, hear it,\" I\nanswered. \"Let me go!\"\n\n\"You have given me your promise to wait for my leave before you open your\nlips. I forbid you to open your lips.\"\n\nI snapped the fingers of my hand that was free, in his face. \"_That_ for\nmy promise!\" I said. \"Your contemptible weakness is putting her happiness\nin peril as well as yours.\" I turned my head towards the door, and called\nto her. \"Lucilla!\"\n\nHis hand closed fast on my arm. Some lurking devil in him that I had\nnever seen yet, leapt up and looked at me out of his eyes.\n\n\"Tell her,\" he whispered savagely between his teeth; \"and I will\ncontradict you to your face! If you are desperate, I am desperate too. I\ndon't care what meanness I am guilty of! I will deny it on my honor; I\nwill deny it on my oath. You heard what she said about you at Browndown.\nShe will believe _me_ before _you._\"\n\nLucilla opened her door, and stood waiting on the threshold.\n\n\"What is it?\" she asked quietly.\n\nA moment's glance at Oscar warned me that he would do what he had\nthreatened, if I persisted in my resolution. The desperation of a weak\nman is, of all desperations, the most unscrupulous and the most\nunmanageable--when it is once roused. Angry as I was, I shrank from\ndegrading him, as I must now have degraded him, if I matched my obstinacy\nagainst his. In mercy to both of them, I gave way.\n\n\"I may be going out, my dear, before it gets dark,\" I said to Lucilla.\n\"Can I do anything for you in the village?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"if you will wait a little, you can take a letter for me\nto the post.\"\n\nShe went back into her room, and closed the door.\n\nI neither looked at Oscar, nor spoke to him, when we were alone again. He\nwas the first who broke the silence.\n\n\"You have remembered your promise to me,\" he said. \"You have done well.\"\n\n\"I have nothing more to say to you,\" I answered. \"I shall go to my own\nroom.\"\n\nHis eyes followed me uneasily as I walked to the door.\n\n\"I shall speak to her,\" he muttered doggedly, \"at my own time.\"\n\nA wise woman would not have allowed him to irritate her into saying\nanother word. Alas! I am not a wise woman--that is to say, not always.\n\n\"Your own time?\" I repeated with the whole force of my contempt. \"If you\ndon't own the truth to her before the German surgeon comes back, your\ntime will have gone by for ever. He has told us in the plainest\nterms--when once the operation is performed, nothing must be said to\nagitate or distress her, for months afterwards. The preservation of her\ntranquillity is the condition of the recovery of her sight. You will soon\nhave an excuse for your silence, Mr. Oscar Dubourg!\"\n\nThe tone in which I said those last words stung him to some purpose.\n\n\"Spare your sneers, you heartless Frenchwoman!\" he broke out angrily. \"I\ndon't care how I stand in _your_ estimation. Lucilla loves me. Nugent\nfeels for me.\"\n\nMy vile temper instantly hit on the most merciless answer that I could\nmake to him in return.\n\n\"Ah, poor Lucilla!\" I said. \"What a much happier prospect hers might have\nbeen! What a thousand pities it is that she is not going to marry your\nbrother, instead of marrying _you!_\"\n\nHe winced under that reply, as if I had cut him with a knife. His head\ndropped on his breast. He started back from me like a beaten dog--and\nsuddenly and silently left the room.\n\nI had not been a minute by myself, before my anger cooled. I tried to\nkeep it hot; I tried to remember that he had aspersed my nation in\ncalling me a \"heartless Frenchwoman.\" No! it was not to be done. In spite\nof myself, I repented what I had said to him.\n\nIn a moment more, I was out on the stairs to try if I could overtake him.\n\nI was too late. I heard the garden-gate bang, before I was out of the\nhouse. Twice I approached the gate to follow him. And twice I drew back,\nin the fear of making bad worse. It ended in my returning to the\nsitting-room, very seriously dissatisfied with myself.\n\nThe first welcome interruption to my solitude came--not from Lucilla--but\nfrom the old nurse. Zillah appeared with a letter for me: left that\nmoment at the rectory by the servant from Browndown. The direction was in\nOscar's handwriting. I opened the envelope, and read these words:--\n\n\"MADAME PRATOLUNGO,--YOU have distressed and pained me more than I can\nsay. There are faults, and serious ones, on my side, I know. I heartily\nbeg your pardon for anything that I may have said or done to offend you.\nI cannot submit to your hard verdict on me. If you knew how I adore\nLucilla, you would make allowances for me--you would understand me better\nthan you do. I cannot get your last cruel words out of my ears. I cannot\nmeet you again without some explanation of them. You stabbed me to the\nheart, when you said to me this evening that it would be a happier\nprospect for Lucilla if she had been going to marry my brother instead of\nmarrying me. I hope you did not really mean that? Will you please write\nand tell me whether you did or not?\n\n\"OSCAR.\"\n\nWrite and tell him? It was absurd enough--when we were within a few\nminutes' walk of each other--that Oscar should prefer the cold formality\nof a letter, to the friendly ease of a personal interview. Why could he\nnot have called, and spoken to me? We should have made it up together far\nmore comfortably in that way--and in half the time. At any rate, I\ndetermined to go to Browndown, and be good friends again, viv\u00c3\u00a2-voce,\nwith this poor, weak, well-meaning, ill-judging boy. Was it not monstrous\nto have attached serious meaning to what Oscar had said when he was in a\npanic of nervous terror! His tone of writing so keenly distressed me that\nI resented his letter on that very account. It was one of the chilly\nevenings of an English June. A small fire was burning in the grate. I\ncrumpled up the letter, and threw it, as I supposed, into the fire.\n(After-events showed that I only threw it into a corner of the fender\ninstead.) Then, I put on my hat, without stopping to think of Lucilla, or\nof what she was writing for the post, and ran off to Browndown.\n\nWhere do you think I found him? Locked up in his own room! His insane\nshyness--it was really nothing less--made him shrink from that very\npersonal explanation which (with such a temperament as mine) was the only\npossible explanation under the circumstances. I had to threaten him with\nforcing his door, before I could get him to show himself, and take my\nhand.\n\nOnce face to face with him, I soon set things right. I really believe he\nhad been half mad with his own self-imposed troubles, when he had\ndeclared he would give me the lie at the door of Lucilla's room.\n\nIt is needless to dwell on what took place between us. I shall only say\nhere that I had serious reason, at a later time--as you will soon see--to\nregret not having humoured Oscar's request that I should reconcile myself\nto him by writing, instead of by word of mouth. If I had only placed on\nrecord, in pen and ink, what I actually said in the way of making\natonement to him, I might have spared some suffering to myself and to\nothers. As it was, the only proof that I had absolved myself in his\nestimation consisted in his cordially shaking hands with me at the door,\nwhen I left him.\n\n\"Did you meet Nugent?\" he asked, as he walked with me across the\nenclosure in front of the house.\n\nI had gone to Browndown by a short cut at the back of the garden, instead\nof going through the village. Having mentioned this, I asked if Nugent\nhad returned to the rectory.\n\n\"He went back to see you,\" said Oscar.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Only his usual kindness. He takes your views of things. He laughed when\nhe heard I had sent a letter to you, and he ran off (dear fellow!) to see\nyou on my behalf. You must have met him, if you had come here by the\nvillage.\"\n\nOn getting back to the rectory, I questioned Zillah. Nugent, in my\nabsence, had run up into the sitting-room; had waited there a few minutes\nalone, on the chance of my return; had got tired of waiting, and had gone\naway again. I inquired about Lucilla next. A few minutes after Nugent had\ngone, she had left her room, and she too had asked for me. Hearing that I\nwas not to be found in the house, she had given Zillah a letter to\npost--and had then returned to her bed-chamber.\n\nI happened to be standing by the hearth, looking into the dying fire,\nwhile the nurse was speaking. Not a vestige of Oscar's letter to me (as I\nnow well remember) was to be seen. In my position, the plain conclusion\nwas that I had really done what I supposed myself to have done--that is\nto say, thrown the letter into the flames.\n\nEntering Lucilla's room, soon afterwards, to make my apologies for having\nforgotten to wait and take her letter to the post, I found her, weary\nenough after the events of the day, getting ready for bed.\n\n\"I don't wonder at your being tired of waiting for me,\" she said.\n\"Writing is long, long work for me. But this was a letter which I felt\nbound to write myself, if I could. Can you guess who I am corresponding\nwith? It is done, my dear! I have written to Herr Grosse!\"\n\n\"Already!\"\n\n\"What is there to wait for? What is there left to determine on? I have\ntold Herr Grosse that our family consultation is over, and that I am\nentirely at his disposal for any length of time he may think right. And I\nwarn him, if he attempts to put it off, that he will be only forcing on\nme the inconvenience of going to him in London. I have expressed that\npart of my letter strongly--I can tell you! He will get it to-morrow, by\nthe afternoon post. And the next day--if he is a man of his word--he will\nbe here.\"\n\n\"Oh, Lucilla! not to operate on your eyes?\"\n\n\"Yes--to operate on my eyes!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-THIRD\n\nThe Day Between\n\nTHE interval-day before the second appearance of Herr Grosse, and the\nexperiment on Lucilla's sight that was to follow it, was marked by two\nincidents which ought to be noticed in this place.\n\nThe first incident was the arrival, early in the morning, of another\nletter addressed to me privately by Oscar Dubourg. Like many other shy\npeople, he had a perfect mania, where any embarrassing circumstances were\nconcerned, for explaining himself, with difficulty, by means of his pen,\nin preference to explaining himself, with ease, by means of his tongue.\n\nOscar's present communication informed me that he had left us for London\nby the first morning train, and that his object in taking this sudden\njourney was--to state his present position towards Lucilla to a gentleman\nespecially conversant with the peculiarities of blind people. In plain\nwords, he had resolved on applying to Mr. Sebright for advice.\n\n\"I like Mr. Sebright\" (Oscar wrote) \"as cordially as I detest Herr\nGrosse. The short conversation I had with him has left me with the\npleasantest impression of his delicacy and his kindness. If I freely\nreveal to this skillful surgeon the sad situation in which I am placed, I\nbelieve his experience will throw an entirely new light on the present\nstate of Lucilla's mind, and on the changes which we may expect to see\nproduced in her, if she really does recover her sight. The result may be\nof incalculable benefit in teaching me how I may own the truth, most\nharmlessly to her, as well as to myself. Pray don't suppose I undervalue\nyour advice. I only want to be doubly fortified, before I risk my\nconfession, by the advice of a scientific man.\"\n\nAll this I took to mean, in plain English, that vacillating Oscar wanted\nto quiet his conscience by gaining time, and that his absurd idea of\nconsulting Mr. Sebright was nothing less than a new and plausible excuse\nfor putting off the evil day. His letter ended by pledging me to secrecy,\nand by entreating me so to manage matters as to grant him a private\ninterview on his return to Dimchurch by the evening train.\n\nI confess I felt some curiosity as to what would come of the proposed\nconsultation between unready Oscar and precise Mr. Sebright--and I\naccordingly arranged to take my walk alone, towards eight o'clock that\nevening, on the road that led to the distant railway station.\n\n\n\nThe second incident of the day may be described as a confidential\nconversation between Lucilla and myself, on the subject which now equally\nabsorbed us both--the momentous subject of her restoration to the\nblessing of sight.\n\nShe joined me at the breakfast-table with her ready distrust newly\nexcited, poor thing, by Oscar. He had accounted to her for his journey to\nLondon by putting forward the commonplace excuse of \"business.\" She\ninstantly suspected (knowing how he felt about it) that he was secretly\nbent on interfering with the performance of the operation by Herr Grosse.\nI contrived to compose the anxiety thus aroused in her mind, by informing\nher, on Oscar's own authority, that he personally disliked and distrusted\nthe German oculist. \"Make your mind easy,\" I said. \"I answer for his not\nventuring near Herr Grosse.\"\n\nA long silence between us followed those words. When Lucilla next\nreferred to Oscar in connection with the coming operation, the depressed\nstate of her spirits seemed to have quite altered her view of her own\nprospects. She, of all the people in the world, now spoke in\ndisparagement of the blessing conferred on the blind by the recovery of\ntheir sight!\n\n\"Do you know one thing?\" she said. \"If I had not been going to be married\nto Oscar, I doubt if I should have cared to put any oculist, native or\nforeign, to the trouble of coming to Dimchurch.\"\n\n\"I don't think I understand you,\" I answered. \"You cannot surely mean to\nsay that you would not have been glad, under any circumstances, to\nrecover your sight?\"\n\n\"That is just what I do mean to say.\"\n\n\"What! you, who have written to Grosse to hurry the operation, don't care\nto see?\"\n\n\"I only care to see Oscar. And, what is more, I only care to see him\nbecause I am in love with him. But for that, I really don't feel as if it\nwould give me any particular pleasure to use my eyes. I have been blind\nso long, I have learnt to do without them.\"\n\n\"And yet, you looked perfectly entranced when Nugent first set you\ndoubting whether you were blind for life?\"\n\n\"Nugent took me by surprise,\" she answered; \"Nugent startled me out of my\nsenses. I have had time to think since; I am not carried away by the\nenthusiasm of the moment now. You people who can see attach such an\nabsurd importance to your eyes! I set my touch, my dear, against your\neyes, as much the most trustworthy, and much the most intelligent sense\nof the two. If Oscar was not, as I have said, the uppermost feeling with\nme, shall I tell you what I should have infinitely preferred to\nrecovering my sight--supposing it could have been done?\" She shook her\nhead with a comic resignation to circumstances. \"Unfortunately, it can't\nbe done!\"\n\n\"What can't be done?\"\n\nShe suddenly held out both her arms over the breakfast-table.\n\n\"The stretching out of _these_ to an enormous and unheard-of length. That\nis what I should have liked!\" she answered. \"I could find out better what\nwas going on at a distance with my hands, than you could with your eyes\nand your telescopes. What doubts I might set at rest for instance about\nthe planetary system, among the people who can see, if I could only\nstretch out far enough to touch the stars.\"\n\n\"This is talking sheer nonsense, Lucilla!\"\n\n\"Is it? Just tell me which knows best in the dark--my touch or your eyes?\nWho has got a sense that she can always trust to serve her equally well\nthrough the whole four-and-twenty hours? You or me? But for Oscar--to\nspeak in sober earnest, this time--I tell you I would much rather perfect\nthe sense in me that I have already got, than have a sense given to me\nthat I have _not_ got. Until I knew Oscar, I don't think I ever honestly\nenvied any of you the use of your eyes.\"\n\n\"You astonish me, Lucilla!\"\n\nShe rattled her teaspoon impatiently in her empty cup.\n\n\"Can you always trust your eyes, even in broad daylight?\" she burst out.\n\"How often do they deceive you, in the simplest things? What did I hear\nyou all disputing about the other day in the garden? You were looking at\nsome view?\"\n\n\"Yes--at the view down the alley of trees at the other end of the\nchurchyard wall.\"\n\n\"Some object in the alley had attracted general notice--had it not?\"\n\n\"Yes--an object at the further end of it.\"\n\n\"I heard you up here. You all differed in opinion, in spite of your\nwonderful eyes. My father said it moved. You said it stood still. Oscar\nsaid it was a man. Mrs. Finch said it was a calf. Nugent ran off, and\nexamined this amazing object at close quarters. And what did it turn out\nto be? A stump of an old tree blown across the road in the night! Why am\nI to envy people the possession of a sense which plays them such tricks\nas that? No! no! Herr Grosse is going to 'cut into my cataracts,' as he\ncalls it--because I am going to be married to a man I love; and I fancy,\nlike a fool, I may love him better still, if I can see him. I may be\nquite wrong,\" she added archly. \"It may end in my not loving him half as\nwell as I do now!\"\n\nI thought of Oscar's face, and felt a sickening fear that she might be\nspeaking far more seriously than she suspected. I tried to change the\nsubject. No! Her imaginative nature had found its way into a new region\nof speculation before I could open my lips.\n\n\"I associate light,\" she said thoughtfully, \"with all that is beautiful\nand heavenly--and dark with all that is vile and horrible and devilish. I\nwonder how light and dark will look to me when I see?\"\n\n\"I believe they will astonish you,\" I answered, \"by being entirely unlike\nwhat you fancy them to be now.\"\n\nShe started. I had alarmed her without intending it.\n\n\"Will Oscar's face be utterly unlike what I fancy it to be now?\" she\nasked, in suddenly altered tones. \"Do you mean to say that I have not had\nthe right image of him in my mind all this time?\"\n\nI tried again to draw her off to another topic. What more could I\ndo--with my tongue tied by the German's warning to us not to agitate her,\nin the face of the operation to be performed on the next day?\n\nIt was quite useless. She went on, as before, without heeding me.\n\n\"Have I no means of judging rightly what Oscar is like?\" she said. \"I\ntouch my own face; I know how long it is and how broad it is; I know how\nbig the different features are, and where they are. And then I touch\nOscar, and compare his face with my knowledge of my own face. Not a\nsingle detail escapes me. I see him in my mind as plainly as you see me\nacross this table. Do you mean to say, when I see him with my eyes, that\nI shall discover something perfectly new to me? I don't believe it!\" She\nstarted up impatiently, and took a turn in the room. \"Oh!\" she exclaimed,\nwith a stamp of her foot, \"why can't I take laudanum enough, or\nchloroform enough to kill me for the next six weeks--and then come to\nlife again when the German takes the bandage off my eyes!\" She sat down\nonce more, and drifted all on a sudden into a question of pure morality.\n\"Tell me this,\" she said. \"Is the greatest virtue, the virtue which it is\nmost difficult to practice?\"\n\n\"I suppose so,\" I answered.\n\nShe drummed with both hands on the table, petulantly, viciously, as hard\nas she could.\n\n\"Then, Madame Pratolungo,\" she said, \"the greatest of all the virtues\nis--Patience. Oh, my friend, how I hate the greatest of all the virtues\nat this moment!\"\n\nThat ended it--there the conversation found its way into other topics at\nlast.\n\nThinking afterwards of the new side of her mind which Lucilla had shown\nto me, I derived one consolation from what had passed at the\nbreakfast-table. If Mr. Sebright proved to be right, and if the operation\nfailed after all, I had Lucilla's word for it that blindness, of itself,\nis not the terrible affliction to the blind which the rest of us fancy it\nto be--because we can see.\n\nTowards half-past seven in the evening, I went out alone, as I had\nplanned, to meet Oscar on his return from London.\n\nAt a long straight stretch of the road, I saw him advancing towards me.\nHe was walking more rapidly than usual, and singing as he walked. Even\nthrough its livid discoloration, the poor fellow's face looked radiant\nwith happiness as he came nearer. He waved his walking-stick exultingly\nin the air. \"Good news!\" he called out at the top of his voice. \"Mr.\nSebright has made me a happy man again!\" I had never before seen him so\nlike Nugent in manner, as I now saw him when we met and he shook hands\nwith me.\n\n\"Tell me all about it,\" I said.\n\nHe gave me his arm; and, talking all the way, we walked back slowly to\nDimchurch.\n\n\"In the first place,\" he began, \"Mr. Sebright holds to his own opinion\nmore firmly than ever. He feels absolutely certain that the operation\nwill fail.\"\n\n\"Is that your good news?\" I asked reproachfully.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"Though, mind, I own to my shame there was a time when I\nalmost hoped it would fail. Mr. Sebright has put me in a better frame of\nmind. I have little or nothing to dread from the success of the\noperation--if, by any extraordinary chance, it should succeed. I remind\nyou of Mr. Sebright's opinion merely to give you a right idea of the tone\nwhich he took with me at starting. He only consented under protest to\ncontemplate the event which Lucilla and Herr Grosse consider to be a\ncertainty. 'If the statement of your position requires it,' he said, 'I\nwill admit that it is barely possible she may be able to see you two\nmonths hence. Now begin.' I began by informing him of my marriage\nengagement.\"\n\n\"Shall I tell you how Mr. Sebright received the information?\" I said. \"He\nheld his tongue, and made you a bow.\"\n\nOscar laughed.\n\n\"Quite true!\" he answered. \"I told him next of Lucilla's extraordinary\nantipathy to dark people, and dark shades of color of all kinds. Can you\nguess what he said to me when I had done?\"\n\nI owned that my observation of Mr. Sebright's character did not extend to\nguessing that.\n\n\"He said it was a common antipathy in his experience of the blind. It was\none among the many strange influences exercised by blindness on the mind.\n'The physical affliction has its mysterious moral influence,' he said.\n'We can observe it, but we can't explain it. The special antipathy which\nyou mention, is an incurable antipathy, except on one condition--the\nrecovery of the sight.' There he stopped. I entreated him to go on. No!\nHe declined to go on until I had finished what I had to say to him first.\nI had my confession still to make to him--and I made it.\"\n\n\"You concealed nothing?\"\n\n\"Nothing. I laid my weakness bare before him. I told him that Lucilla was\nstill firmly convinced that Nugent's was the discolored face, instead of\nmine. And then I put the question--What am I to do?\"\n\n\"And how did he reply?\"\n\n\"In these words:--'If you ask me what you are to do, in the event of her\nremaining blind (which I tell you again will be the event), I decline to\nadvise you. Your own conscience and your own sense of honor must decide\nthe question. On the other hand, if you ask me what you are to do, in the\nevent of her recovering her sight, I can answer you unreservedly in the\nplainest terms. Leave things as they are; and wait till she sees.' Those\nwere his own words. Oh, the load that they took off my mind! I made him\nrepeat them--I declare I was almost afraid to trust the evidence of my\nown ears.\"\n\nI understood the motive of Oscar's good spirits, better than I understood\nthe motive of Mr. Sebright's advice. \"Did he give his reasons?\" I asked.\n\n\"You shall hear his reasons directly. He insisted on first satisfying\nhimself that I thoroughly understood my position at that moment. 'The\nprime condition of success, as Herr Grosse has told you,' he said, 'is\nthe perfect tranquillity of the patient. If you make your confession to\nthe young lady when you get back to-night to Dimchurch, you throw her\ninto a state of excitement which will render it impossible for my German\ncolleague to operate on her to-morrow. If you defer your confession, the\nmedical necessities of the case force you to be silent, until the\nprofessional attendance of the oculist has ceased. There is your\nposition! My advice to you is to adopt the last alternative. Wait (and\nmake the other persons in the secret wait) until the result of the\noperation has declared itself.' There I stopped him. 'Do you mean that I\nam to be present, on the first occasion when she is able to use her\neyes?' I asked. 'Am I to let her see me, without a word beforehand to\nprepare her for the color of my face?'\"\n\nWe were now getting to the interesting part of it. You English people,\nwhen you are out walking and are carrying on a conversation with a\nfriend, never come to a standstill at the points of interest. We\nforeigners, on the other hand, invariably stop. I surprised Oscar by\nsuddenly pulling him up in the middle of the road.\n\n\"What is the matter?\" he asked.\n\n\"Go on!\" I said impatiently.\n\n\"I can't go on,\" he rejoined. \"You're holding me.\"\n\nI held him tighter than ever, and ordered him more resolutely than ever\nto go on. Oscar resigned himself to a halt (foreign fashion) on the high\nroad.\n\n\"Mr. Sebright met my question by putting a question on his side,\" he\nresumed. \"He asked me how I proposed to prepare her for the color of my\nface.\"\n\n\"And what did you tell him?\"\n\n\"I said I had planned to make an excuse for leaving Dimchurch--and, once\naway, to prepare her, by writing, for what she might expect to see when I\nreturned.\"\n\n\"What did he say to that?\"\n\n\"He wouldn't hear of it. He said, 'I strongly recommend you to be present\non the first occasion when she is capable (if she ever is capable) of\nusing her sight. I attach the greatest importance to her being able to\ncorrect the hideous and absurd image now in her mind of a face like\nyours, by seeing you as you really are at the earliest available\nopportunity.'\"\n\nWe were just walking on again, when certain words in that last sentence\nstartled me. I stopped short once more.\n\n\"Hideous and absurd image?\" I repeated, thinking instantly of my\nconversation of that morning with Lucilla. \"What did Mr. Sebright mean by\nusing such language as that?\"\n\n\"Just what I asked him. His reply will interest you. It led him into that\nexplanation of his motives which you inquired for just now. Shall we walk\non?\"\n\nMy petrified foreign feet recovered their activity. We went on again.\n\n\"When I had spoken to Mr. Sebright of Lucilla's inveterate prejudice,\"\nOscar continued, \"he had surprised me by saying that it was common in his\nexperience, and was only curable by her restoration to sight. In support\nof those assertions, he now told me of two interesting cases which had\noccurred in his professional practice. The first was the case of the\nlittle daughter of an Indian officer--blind from infancy like Lucilla.\nAfter operating successfully, the time came when he could permit his\npatient to try her sight--that is to say, to try if she could see\nsufficiently well at first, to distinguish dark objects from light. Among\nthe members of the household assembled to witness the removal of the\nbandage, was an Indian nurse who had accompanied the family to England.\nThe first person the child saw was her mother--a fair woman. She clasped\nher little hands in astonishment, and that was all. At the next turn of\nher head, she saw the dark Indian nurse and instantly screamed with\nterror. Mr. Sebright owned to me that he could not explain it. The child\ncould have no possible association with colors. Yet there nevertheless\nwas the most violent hatred and horror of a dark object (the hatred and\nhorror peculiar to the blind) expressing itself unmistakably in a child\nof ten years old! My first thought, while he was telling me this, was of\nmyself, and of my chance with Lucilla. My first question was, 'Did the\nchild get used to the nurse?' I can give you his answer in his own words.\n'In a week's time, I found the child sitting in the nurse's lap as\ncomposedly as I am sitting in this chair.'--\"That is encouraging--isn't\nit?\"\n\n\"Most encouraging--nobody can deny it.\"\n\n\"The second instance was more curious still. This time the case was the\ncase of a grown man--and the object was to show me what strange fantastic\nimages (utterly unlike the reality) the blind form of the people about\nthem. The patient was married, and was to see his wife (as Lucilla is one\nday to see me) for the first time. He had been told, before he married\nher, that she was personally disfigured by the scar of a wound on one of\nher cheeks. The poor woman--ah, how well I can understand her!--trembled\nfor the consequences. The man who had loved her dearly while he was\nblind, might hate her when he saw her scarred face. Her husband had been\nthe first to console her when the operation was determined on. He\ndeclared that his sense of touch, and the descriptions given to him by\nothers, had enabled him to form, in his own mind, the most complete and\nfaithful image of his wife's face. Nothing that Mr. Sebright could say\nwould induce him to believe that it was physically impossible for him to\nform a really correct idea of any object, animate or inanimate, which he\nhad never seen. He wouldn't hear of it. He was so certain of the result,\nthat he held his wife's hand in his, to encourage her, when the bandage\nwas removed from him. At his first look at her, he uttered a cry of\nhorror, and fell back in his chair in a swoon. His wife, poor thing, was\ndistracted. Mr. Sebright did his best to compose her, and waited till her\nhusband was able to answer the questions put to him. It then appeared\nthat his blind idea of his wife, and of her disfigurement had been\nsomething so grotesquely and horribly unlike the reality, that it was\nhard to know whether to laugh or to tremble at it. She was as beautiful\nas an angel, by comparison with her husband's favorite idea of her--and\nyet, because it was his idea, he was absolutely disgusted and terrified\nat the first sight of her! In a few weeks he was able to compare his wife\nwith other women, to look at pictures, to understand what beauty was and\nwhat ugliness was--and from that time they have lived together as happy a\nmarried couple as any in the kingdom.\"\n\nI was not quite sure which way this last example pointed. It alarmed me\nwhen I thought of Lucilla. I came to a standstill again.\n\n\"How did Mr. Sebright apply this second case to Lucilla and to you?\" I\nasked.\n\n\"You shall hear,\" said Oscar. \"He first appealed to the case as\nsupporting his assertion that Lucilla's idea of me must be utterly unlike\nwhat I am myself. He asked if I was now satisfied that she could have no\ncorrect conception of what faces and colors were really like? and if I\nagreed with him in believing that the image in her mind of the man with\nthe blue face, was in all probability something fantastically and\nhideously unlike the reality? After what I had heard, I agreed with him\nas a matter of course. 'Very well,' says Mr. Sebright. 'Now let its\nremember that there is one important difference between the case of Miss\nFinch, and the case that I have just mentioned. The husband's blind idea\nof his wife was the husband's favorite idea. The shock of the first sight\nof her, was plainly a shock to him on that account. Now Miss Finch's\nblind idea of the blue face is, on the contrary, a hateful idea to\nher--the image is an image that she loathes. Is it not fair to conclude\nfrom this, that the first sight of you as you really are, is likely to\nbe, in her case, a relief to her instead of a shock? Reasoning from my\nexperience, I reach that conclusion; and I advise you, in your own\ninterests, to be present when the bandage is taken off. Even if I prove\nto be mistaken--even if she is not immediately reconciled to the sight of\nyou--there is the other example of the child and the Indian nurse to\nsatisfy you that it is only a question of time. Sooner or later, she will\ntake the discovery as any other young lady would take it. At first, she\nwill be indignant with you for deceiving her; and then, if you are sure\nof your place in her affections, she will end in forgiving you.--There is\nmy view of your position, and there are the grounds on which I form it!\nIn the meantime, my own opinion remains unshaken. I firmly believe that\nyou will never have occasion to act on the advice that I have given to\nyou. When the bandage is taken off, the chances are five hundred to one\nthat she is no nearer to seeing you then than she is now.' These were his\nlast words--and on that we parted.\"\n\nOscar and I walked on again for a little way, in silence.\n\nI had nothing to say against Mr. Sebright's reasons; it was impossible to\nquestion the professional experience from which they were drawn. As to\nblind people in general, I felt no doubt that his advice was good, and\nthat his conclusions were arrived at correctly. But Lucilla's was no\nordinary character. My experience of her was better experience than Mr.\nSebright's--and the more I thought of the future, the less inclined I\nfelt to share Oscar's hopeful view. She was just the person to say\nsomething or do something, at the critical moment of the experiment,\nwhich would take the wisest previous calculation by surprise. Oscar's\nprospects never had looked darker to me than they looked at that moment.\n\nIt would have been useless and cruel to have said to him what I have just\nsaid here. I put as bright a face on it as I could, and asked if he\nproposed to follow Mr. Sebright's advice.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"With a certain reservation of my own, which occurred to\nme after I had left his house.\"\n\n\"May I ask what it is?\"\n\n\"Certainly. I mean to beg Nugent to leave Dimchurch, before Lucilla tries\nher sight for the first time. He will do that, I know, to please me.\"\n\n\"And when he has done it, what then?\"\n\n\"Then I mean to be present--as Mr. Sebright suggested--when the bandage\nis taken off.\"\n\n\"Previously telling Lucilla,\" I interposed, \"that it is you who are in\nthe room?\"\n\n\"No. There I take the precaution that I alluded to just now. I propose to\nleave Lucilla under the impression that it is I who have left Dimchurch,\nand that Nugent's face is the face she sees. If Mr. Sebright proves to be\nright, and if her first sensation is a sensation of relief, I will own\nthe truth to her the same day. If not, I will wait to make my confession\nuntil she has become reconciled to the sight of me. That plan meets every\npossible emergency. It is one of the few good ideas that my stupid head\nhas hit on since I have been at Dimchurch.\"\n\nHe said those last words with such an innocent air of triumph, that I\nreally could not find it in my heart to damp his ardor by telling him\nwhat I thought of his idea. All I said was, \"Don't forget, Oscar, that\nthe cleverest plans are at the mercy of circumstances. At the last\nmoment, an accident may happen which will force you to speak out.\"\n\nWe came in sight of the rectory as I gave him that final warning. Nugent\nwas strolling up and down the road on the look-out for us. I left Oscar\nto tell his story over again to his brother, and went into the house.\n\nLucilla was at her piano when I entered the sitting-room. She was not\nonly playing--but (a rare thing with her) singing too. The song was,\npoetry and music both, of her own composing. \"I shall see him! I shall\nsee him!\" In those four words the composition began and ended. She\nadapted them to all the happy melodies in her memory. She accompanied\nthem with hands that seemed to be mad for joy--hands that threatened\nevery moment to snap the chords of the instrument. Never, since my first\nday at the rectory, had I heard such a noise in our quiet sitting-room as\nI heard now. She was in a fever of exhilaration which, in my foreboding\nframe of mind at that moment, it pained and shocked me to see. I lifted\nher off the music-stool, and shut up the piano by main force.\n\n\"Compose yourself for heaven's sake,\" I said. \"Do you want to be\ncompletely exhausted when the German comes tomorrow?\"\n\nThat consideration instantly checked her. She suddenly became quiet, with\nthe abrupt facility of a child.\n\n\"I forgot that,\" she said, sitting down in a corner, with a face of\ndismay. \"He might refuse to perform the operation! Oh, my dear, quiet me\ndown somehow. Get a book, and read to me.\"\n\nI got the book. Ah, the poor author! Neither she nor I paid the slightest\nattention to him. Worse still, we abused him for not interesting us--and\nthen shut him up with a bang, and pushed him rudely into his place on the\nbook-shelf, and left him upside down and went to bed.\n\nShe was standing at her window when I went in to wish her good night. The\nmellow moonlight fell tenderly on her lovely face.\n\n\"Moon that I have never seen,\" she murmured softly, \"I feel you looking\nat me! Is the time coming when I shall look at You?\" She turned from the\nwindow, and eagerly put my fingers on her pulse. \"Am I quite composed\nagain?\" she asked. \"Will he find me well to-morrow? Feel it! feel it! Is\nit quiet now?\"\n\nI felt it--throbbing faster and faster.\n\n\"Sleep will quiet it,\" I said--and kissed her, and left her.\n\n\n\nShe slept well. As for me, I passed such a wretched night, and got up so\ncompletely worn out, that I had to go back to my room after breakfast,\nand lie down again. Lucilla persuaded me to do it. \"Herr Grosse won't be\nhere till the afternoon,\" she said. \"Rest till he comes.\"\n\nWe had reckoned without allowing for the eccentric character of our\nGerman surgeon. Excepting the business of his profession, Herr Grosse did\neverything by impulse, and nothing by rule. I had not long fallen into a\nbroken unrefreshing sleep, when I felt Zillah's hand on my shoulder, and\nheard Zillah's voice in my ear.\n\n\"Please to get up, ma'am! He's here--he has come from London by the\nmorning train.\"\n\nI hurried into the sitting-room.\n\nThere, at the table, sat Herr Grosse with an open instrument-case before\nhim; his wild black eyes gloating over a hideous array of scissors,\nprobes, and knives, and his shabby hat hard by with lint and bandages\nhuddled together anyhow inside it. And there stood Lucilla by his side,\nstooping over him--with one hand laid familiarly on his shoulder, and\nwith the other deftly fingering one of his horrid instruments to find out\nwhat it was like!\n\n\nTHE END OF THE FIRST PART\n\n\n\n\nPART THE SECOND\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-FOURTH\n\nNugent shows his Hand\n\nI CLOSED the First Part of my narrative on the day of the operation, the\ntwenty-fifth of June.\n\nI open the Second Part, between six and seven weeks later, on the ninth\nof August.\n\nHow did the time pass at Dimchurch in that interval?\n\nSearching backwards in my memory, I call to life again the domestic\nhistory of the six weeks. It looks, on retrospection, miserably dull and\nempty of incident. I wonder when I contemplate it now, how we got through\nthat weary interval--how we bore that forced inaction, that unrelieved\noppression of suspense.\n\n\n\nChanging from bed-room to sitting-room, from sitting-room back to\nbed-room; with the daylight always shut out; with the bandages always on,\nexcept when the surgeon looked at her eyes; Lucilla bore the\nimprisonment--and worse than the imprisonment, the uncertainty--of her\nperiod of probation, with the courage that can endure anything, the\ncourage sustained by Hope. With books, with music, with talk--above all,\nwith Love to help her--she counted her way calmly through the dull\nsuccession of hours and days till the time came which was to decide the\nquestion in dispute between the oculists--the terrible question of which\nof the two, Mr. Sebright or Herr Grosse, was right.\n\nI was not present at the examination which finally decided all doubt. I\njoined Oscar in the garden--quite as incapable as he was of exerting the\nslightest self-control. We paced silently backwards and forwards on the\nlawn, like two animals in a cage. Zillah was the only witness present\nwhen the German examined our poor darling's eyes; Nugent engaging to wait\nin the next room and announce the result from the window. As the event\nturned out, Herr Grosse was beforehand with him. Once more we heard his\nbroken English shouting, \"Hi-hi-hoi! hoi-hi! hoi-hi!\" Once more, we\nbeheld his huge silk handkerchief waving at the window. I turned sick and\nfaint under the excitement of the moment--under the rapture (it was\nnothing less) of hearing those three electrifying words: \"She will see!\"\nMercy! how we did abuse Mr. Sebright, when we were all reunited again in\nLucilla's room!\n\nThe first excitement over, we had our difficulties to contend with next.\n\nFrom the moment when she was positively informed that the operation had\nsucceeded, our once-patient Lucilla developed into a new being. She now\nrose in perpetual revolt against the caution which still deferred the day\non which she was to be allowed to make the first trial of her sight. It\nrequired all my influence, backed by Oscar's entreaties, and strengthened\nby the furious foreign English of our excellent German surgeon (Herr\nGrosse had a temper of his own, I can tell you!) to prevent her from\nbreaking through the medical discipline which held her in its grasp. When\nshe became quite unmanageable, and vehemently abused him to his face, our\ngood Grosse used to swear at her, in a compound bad language of his own,\nwith a tremendous aspiration at the beginning of it, which always set\nmatters right by making her laugh. I see him again as I write, leaving\nthe room on these occasions, with his eyes blazing through his\nspectacles, and his shabby hat cocked sideways on his head. \"Soh, you\nlittle-spitfire-Feench! If you touch that bandages when I have put him\non--Ho-Damn-Damn! I say no more. Good-bye!\"\n\nFrom Lucilla I turn to the twin-brothers next.\n\nTranquilized as to the future, after his interview with Mr. Sebright,\nOscar presented himself at his best during the time of which I am now\nwriting. Lucilla's main reliance in her days in the darkened room, was on\nwhat her lover could do to relieve and to encourage her. He never once\nfailed her; his patience was perfect; his devotion was inexhaustible. It\nis sad to say so, in view of what happened afterwards; but I only tell a\nnecessary truth when I declare that he immensely strengthened his hold on\nher affections, in those last days of her blindness when his society was\nmost precious to her. Ah, how fervently she used to talk of him when she\nand I were left together at night! Forgive me if I leave this part of the\nhistory of the courtship untold. I don't like to write of it--I don't\nlike to think of it. Let us get on to something else.\n\nNugent comes next. I would give a great deal, poor as I am, to be able to\nleave him out. It is not to be done. I must write about that lost wretch,\nand you must read about him, whether we like it or not.\n\nThe days of Lucilla's imprisonment, were also the days when my favorite\ndisappointed me, for the first time. He and his brother seemed to change\nplaces. It was Nugent now who appeared to disadvantage by comparison with\nOscar. He surprised and grieved his brother by leaving Browndown. \"All I\ncan do for you, I have done,\" he said. \"I can be of no further use for\nthe present to anybody. Let me go. I am stagnating in this miserable\nplace--I must, and will, have change.\" Oscar's entreaties, in Nugent's\npresent frame of mind, failed to move him. Away he went one morning,\nwithout bidding anybody goodbye. He had talked of being absent for a\nweek--he remained away for a month. We heard of him, leading a wild life,\namong a vicious set of men. It was reported that a frantic restlessness\npossessed him which nobody could understand. He came back as suddenly as\nhe had left us. His variable nature had swung round, in the interval, to\nthe opposite extreme. He was full of repentance for his reckless conduct;\nhe was in a state of depression which defied rousing; he despaired of\nhimself and his future. Sometimes he talked of going back to America; and\nsometimes he threatened to close his career by enlisting as a private\nsoldier. Would any other person, in my place, have seen which way these\nsigns pointed? I doubt it, if that person's mind had been absorbed, as\nmine was, in watching Lucilla day by day. Even if I had been a suspicious\nwoman by nature--which, thank God, I am not--my distrust must have lain\ndormant, in the all-subduing atmosphere of suspense hanging heavily on me\nmorning, noon, and night in the darkened room.\n\nSo much, briefly, for the sayings and doings of the persons principally\nconcerned in this narrative, during the six weeks which separate Part the\nFirst from Part the Second.\n\nI begin again on the ninth of August.\n\nThis was the memorable day chosen by Herr Grosse for risking the\nexperiment of removing the bandage, and permitting Lucilla to try her\nsight for the first time. Conceive for yourselves (don't ask me to\ndescribe) the excitement that raged in our obscure little circle, now\nthat we were standing face to face with that grand Event in our lives\nwhich I promised to relate in the opening sentence of these pages.\n\nI was the earliest riser at the rectory that morning. My excitable French\nblood was in a fever. I was irresistibly reminded of myself, at a time\nlong past--the time when my glorious Pratolungo and I, succumbing to Fate\nand tyrants, fled to England for safety; martyrs to that ungrateful\nRepublic (long live the Republic!) for which I laid down my money and my\nhusband his life.\n\nI opened my window, and hailed the good omen of sunrise in a clear sky.\nJust as I was turning away again from the view, I saw a figure steal out\nfrom the shrubbery and appear on the lawn. The figure came nearer. I\nrecognized Oscar.\n\n\"What in the world are you doing there, at this time in the morning?\" I\ncalled out.\n\nHe lifted his finger to his lips, and came close under my window before\nhe answered.\n\n\"Hush!\" he said. \"Don't let Lucilla hear you. Come down to me as soon as\nyou can. I am waiting to speak to you.\"\n\nWhen I joined him in the garden, I saw directly that something had gone\nwrong.\n\n\"Bad news from Browndown?\" I asked.\n\n\"Nugent has disappointed me,\" he answered. \"Do you remember the evening\nwhen you met me after my consultation with Mr. Sebright?\"\n\n\"Perfectly.\"\n\n\"I told you that I meant to ask Nugent to leave Dimchurch, on the day\nwhen Lucilla tried her sight for the first time.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well--he refuses to leave Dimchurch.\"\n\n\"Have you explained your motives to him?\"\n\n\"Carefully--before I asked him to go. I told him how impossible it was to\nsay what might happen. I reminded him that it might be of the utmost\nimportance to me to preserve the impression now in Lucilla's mind--for a\ncertain time only--after Lucilla could see. I promised, the moment she\nbecame reconciled to the sight of me, to recall him, and in his presence\nto tell her the truth. All that I said to him--and how do you think he\nanswered me?\"\n\n\"Did he positively refuse?\"\n\n\"No. He walked away from me to the window, and considered a little. Then\nhe turned round suddenly and said 'What did you tell me was Mr.\nSebright's opinion? Mr. Sebright thought she would be relieved instead of\nbeing terrified. In that case, what need is there for me to go away? You\ncan acknowledge at once that she has seen your face, and not mine?' He\nput his hands in his pockets when he had said that (you know Nugent's\ndownright way)--and turned back to the window as if he had settled\neverything.\"\n\n\"What did you say, on your side?\"\n\n\"I said, 'Suppose Mr. Sebright is wrong?' He only answered, 'Suppose Mr.\nSebright is right?' I followed him to the window--I never heard him speak\nso sourly to me as he spoke at that moment. 'What is your objection to\ngoing away for a day or two?' I asked. 'My objection is soon stated,' he\nanswered. 'I am sick of these everlasting complications. It is useless\nand cruel to carry on the deception any longer. Mr. Sebright's advice is\nthe wise advice and the right advice. Let her see you as you are.' With\nthat answer, he walked out of the room. Something has upset him--I can't\nimagine what it is. Do pray see what you can make of him! My only hope is\nin you.\"\n\nI own I felt reluctant to interfere. Suddenly and strangely as Nugent had\naltered his point of view, it seemed to me undeniable that Nugent was\nright. At the same time, Oscar looked so disappointed and distressed,\nthat it was really impossible, on that day above all others, to pain him\nadditionally by roundly saying No. I undertook to do what I could--and I\ninwardly hoped that circumstances would absolve me from the necessity of\ndoing anything at all.\n\nCircumstances failed to justify my selfish confidence in them.\n\nI was out in the village, after breakfast, on a domestic errand connected\nwith the necessary culinary preparations for the reception of Herr\nGrosse--when I heard my name pronounced behind me, and, turning round,\nfound myself face to face with Nugent.\n\n\"Has my brother been bothering you this morning,\" he asked, \"before I was\nup?\"\n\nI instantly noticed a return in him, as he said that, to the same dogged\nungracious manner which had perplexed and displeased me at my last\nconfidential interview with him in the rectory garden.\n\n\"Oscar has been speaking to me this morning,\" I replied.\n\n\"About me?\"\n\n\"About you. You have distressed and disappointed him----\"\n\n\"I know! I know! Oscar is worse than a child. I am beginning to lose all\npatience with him.\"\n\n\"I am sorry to hear you say that, Nugent. You have borne with him so\nkindly thus far--surely you can make allowances for him to-day? His whole\nfuture may depend on what happens in Lucilla's sitting-room a few hours\nhence.\"\n\n\"He is making a mountain out of a mole-hill--and so are you.\"\n\nThose words were spoken bitterly--almost rudely. I answered sharply on my\nside.\n\n\"You are the last person living who has any right to say that. Oscar is\nin a false position towards Lucilla, with your knowledge and consent. In\nyour brother's interests, you agreed to the fraud that has been practiced\non her. In your brother's interests, again, you are asked to leave\nDimchurch. Why do you refuse?\"\n\n\"I refuse, because I have come round to your way of thinking. What did\nyou say of Oscar and of me, in the summer-house? You said we were taking\na cruel advantage of Lucilla's blindness. You were right. It was cruel\nnot to have told her the truth. I won't be a party to concealing the\ntruth from her any longer! I refuse to persist in deceiving her--in\nmeanly deceiving her--on the day when she recovers her sight!\"\n\nIt is entirely beyond my power to describe the tone in which he made that\nreply. I can only declare that it struck me dumb for the moment. I drew a\nstep nearer to him. With vague misgivings in me, I looked him searchingly\nin the face. He looked back at me, without shrinking.\n\n\"Well?\" he asked--with a hard smile which defied me to put him in the\nwrong.\n\nI could discover nothing in his face--I could only follow my instincts as\na woman. Those instincts warned me to accept his explanation.\n\n\"I am to understand then that you have decided on staying here?\" I said.\n\n\"Certainly!\"\n\n\"What do you propose to do, when Herr Grosse arrives, and we assemble in\nLucilla's room?\"\n\n\"I propose to be present among the rest of you, at the most interesting\nmoment of Lucilla's life.\"\n\n\"No! you don't propose that!\"\n\n\"I do!\"\n\n\"You have forgotten something, Mr. Nugent Dubourg.\"\n\n\"What is it, Madame Pratolungo?\"\n\n\"You have forgotten that Lucilla believes the brother with the discolored\nface to be You, and the brother with the fair complexion to be Oscar. You\nhave forgotten that the surgeon has expressly forbidden us to agitate her\nby entering into any explanations before he allows her to use her eyes.\nYou have forgotten that the very deception which you have just positively\nrefused to go on with, will be nevertheless a deception continued, if you\nare present when Lucilla sees. Your own resolution pledges you not to\nenter the rectory doors until Lucilla has discovered the truth.\" In those\nwords I closed the vice on him. I had got Mr. Nugent Dubourg!\n\nHe turned deadly pale. His eyes dropped before mine for the first time.\n\n\"Thank you for reminding me,\" he said. \"I _had_ forgotten.\"\n\nHe pronounced those submissive words in a suddenly-lowered voice.\nSomething in his tone, or something in the dropping of his eyes, set my\nheart beating quickly, with a certain vague expectation which I was\nunable to realize to myself.\n\n\"You agree with me,\" I said, \"that you cannot be one amongst us at the\nrectory? What will you do?\"\n\n\"I will remain at Browndown,\" he answered.\n\nI felt he was lying. Don't ask for my reasons: I have no reasons to give.\nWhen he said \"I will remain at Browndown,\" I felt he was lying.\n\n\"Why not do what Oscar asks of you?\" I went on. \"If you are absent, you\nmay as well be in one place as in another. There is plenty of time still\nto leave Dimchurch.\"\n\nHe looked up as suddenly as he had looked down.\n\n\"Do you and Oscar think me a stock or a stone?\" he burst out angrily.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Who are you indebted to for what is going to happen to-day?\" he went on,\nmore and more passionately. \"You are indebted to Me. Who among you all\nstood alone in refusing to believe that she was blind for life? _I_ did!\nWho brought the man here who has given her back her sight? _I_ brought\nthe man! And I am the one person who is to be left in ignorance of how it\nends. The others are to be present: I am to be sent away. The others are\nto see it: I am to hear by post (if any of you think of writing to me)\nwhat she does, what she says, how she looks, at the first heavenly moment\nwhen she opens her eyes on the world.\" He flung up his hand in the air,\nand burst out savagely with a bitter laugh. \"I astonish you, don't I? I\nam claiming a position which I have no right to occupy. What interest can\n_I_ feel in it? Oh God! what do _I_ care about the woman to whom I have\ngiven a new life?\" His voice broke into a sob at those last wild words.\nHe tore at the breast of his coat as if he was suffocating--and turned,\nand left me.\n\nI stood rooted to the spot. In one breathless instant, the truth broke on\nme like a revelation. At last I had penetrated the terrible secret.\nNugent loved her.\n\nMy first impulse, when I recovered myself, hurried me at the top of my\nspeed back to the rectory. For a moment or two, I think I must really\nhave lost my senses. I felt a frantic suspicion that he had gone into the\nhouse, and that he was making his way to Lucilla at that moment. When I\nfound that all was quiet--when Zillah had satisfied me that no visitor\nhad come near our side of the rectory--I calmed down a little, and went\nback to the garden to compose myself before I ventured into Lucilla's\npresence.\n\nAfter awhile, I got over the first horror of it, and saw my own position\nplainly. There was not a living soul at Dimchurch in whom I could\nconfide. Come what might of it, in this dreadful emergency, I must trust\nin myself alone.\n\nI had just arrived at that startling conclusion; I had shed some bitter\ntears when I remembered how hardly I had judged poor Oscar on more than\none occasion; I had decided that my favorite Nugent was the most hateful\nvillain living, and that I would leave nothing undone that the craft of a\nwoman could compass to drive him out of the place--when I was forced back\nto present necessities by the sound of Zillah's voice calling to me from\nthe house. I went to her directly. The nurse had a message for me from\nher young mistress. My poor Lucilla was lonely and anxious: she was\nsurprised at my leaving her, she insisted on seeing me immediately.\n\nI took my first precaution against a surprise from Nugent, as I crossed\nthe threshold of the door.\n\n\"Our dear child must not be disturbed by visitors to-day,\" I said to\nZillah. \"If Mr. Nugent Dubourg comes here and asks for her--don't tell\nLucilla; tell _me._\"\n\nThis said, I went up-stairs, and joined my darling in the darkened room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-FIFTH\n\nLucilla tries her Sight\n\nSHE was sitting alone in the dim light, with the bandage over her eyes,\nwith her pretty hands crossed patiently on her lap. My heart swelled in\nme as I looked at her, and felt the horrid discovery that I had made\nstill present in my mind. \"Forgive me for leaving you,\" I said in as\nsteady a voice as I could command at the moment--and kissed her.\n\nShe instantly discovered my agitation, carefully as I thought I had\nconcealed it.\n\n\"You are frightened too!\" she exclaimed, taking my hands in hers.\n\n\"Frightened, my love?\" I repeated. (I was perfectly stupefied; I really\ndid not know what to say!)\n\n\"Yes. Now the time is so near, I feel my courage failing me. I forbode\nall sorts of horrible things. Oh! when will it be over? what will Oscar\nlook like when I see him?\"\n\nI answered the first question. Who could answer the second?\n\n\"Herr Grosse comes to us by the morning train,\" I said. \"It will soon be\nover.\"\n\n\"Where is Oscar?\"\n\n\"On his way here, I have no doubt.\"\n\n\"Describe him to me once more,\" she said eagerly. \"For the last time,\nbefore I see. His eyes, his hair, his complexion--everything!\"\n\nHow I should have got through the painful task which she had innocently\nimposed on me, if I had attempted to perform it, I hardly like to think.\nTo my infinite relief, I was interrupted at my first word by the opening\nof the door, and the sudden appearance of a family deputation in the\nroom.\n\nFirst, strutting with slow and solemn steps, with one hand laid\npathetically on the breast of his clerical waistcoat, appeared Reverend\nFinch. After him, came his wife, shorn of all her proper\naccompaniments--except the baby. Without her novel, without her jacket,\npetticoat, or shawl, without even the handkerchief which she was always\nlosing--clothed, for the first time in my experience, in a complete\ngown--the metamorphosis of damp Mrs. Finch was complete. But for the\nbaby, I believe I should have taken her, in the dim light, for a\nstranger! She stood (apparently doubtful of her reception) hesitating in\nthe doorway, and so hiding a third member of the deputation--who appealed\npiteously to the general notice in a small voice which I knew well, and\nin a form of address familiar to me from past experience.\n\n\"Jicks wants to come in.\"\n\nThe rector took his hand from his waistcoat, and held it up in faint\nprotest against the intrusion of the third member. Mrs. Finch moved\nmechanically into the room. Jicks appeared, hugging her disreputable\ndoll, and showing signs of recent wandering in the white dust which\ndropped on the carpet from her frock and her shoes, as she advanced\ntowards the place in which I was sitting. Arrived in front of me, she\npeered quaintly up at my face, through the obscurity of the room; lifted\nher doll by the legs; hit me a smart rap with the head of it on my knee;\nand said--\n\n\"Jicks will sit here.\"\n\nI rubbed my knee, and enthroned Jicks as ordered. At the same time Mr.\nFinch solemnly stalked up to his daughter; laid his hands on her head;\nraised his eyes to the ceiling; and said in bass notes that rumbled with\npaternal emotion, \"Bless you, my child!\"\n\nAt the sound of her husband's magnificent voice, Mrs. Finch became\nherself again. She said meekly, \"How d'ye do, Lucilla?\"--and sat down in\na corner, and suckled the baby.\n\nMr. Finch set in for one of his harangues.\n\n\"My advice has been neglected, Lucilla. My paternal influence has been\nrepudiated. My Moral Weight has been, so to speak, set aside. I don't\ncomplain. Understand me--_I_ simply state sad facts.\" (Here he became\naware of my existence.) \"Good morning, Madame Pratolungo; I hope I see\nyou well?--There has been variance between us, Lucilla. I come, my child,\nwith healing on my wings (healing being understood, for present purposes,\nas reconciliation)--I come, and bring Mrs. Finch with me--don't speak,\nMrs. Finch!--to offer my heartfelt wishes, my fervent prayers, on this\nthe most eventful day in my daughter's life. No vulgar curiosity has\nturned my steps this way. No hint shall escape my lips, touching any\nmisgivings which I may still feel as to this purely worldly interference\nwith the ways of an inscrutable Providence. I am here as parent and\npeacemaker. My wife accompanies me--don't speak, Mrs. Finch!--as\nstep-parent and step-peacemaker. (You understand the distinction, Madame\nPratolungo? Thank you. Good creature.) Shall I preach forgiveness of\ninjuries from the pulpit, and not practice that forgiveness at home? Can\nI remain, on this momentous occasion, at variance with my child? Lucilla!\nI forgive you. With full heart and tearful eyes, I forgive you. (You have\nnever had any children, I believe, Madame Pratolungo? Ah! you cannot\npossibly understand this. Not your fault. Good creature. Not your fault.)\nThe kiss of peace, my child; the kiss of peace.\" He solemnly bent his\nbristly head, and deposited the kiss of peace on Lucilla's forehead. He\nsighed superbly, and in a burst of magnanimity, held out his hand next to\nme. \"My Hand, Madame Pratolungo. Compose yourself. Don't cry. God bless\nyou! Mrs. Finch, deeply affected by her husband's noble conduct, began to\nsob hysterically. The baby, disarranged in his proceedings by the\nemotions of his mama, set up a sympathetic scream. Mr. Finch crossed the\nroom to them, with domestic healing on his wings. \"This does you credit,\nMrs. Finch; but, under the circumstances, it must not be continued.\nControl yourself, in consideration of the infant. Mysterious mechanism of\nNature!\" cried the rector, raising his prodigious voice over the louder\nand louder screeching of the baby. \"Marvelous and beautiful sympathy\nwhich makes the maternal sustenance the conducting medium, as it were, of\ndisturbance between the mother and child. What problems confront us, what\nforces environ us, even in this mortal life! Nature! Maternity!\nInscrutable Providence!\"\n\n\"Inscrutable Providence\" was the rector's fatal phrase--it always brought\nwith it an interruption; and it brought one now. Before Mr. Finch\n(brimful of pathetic apostrophes) could burst into more exclamations, the\ndoor opened, and Oscar walked into the room.\n\nLucilla instantly recognized his footstep.\n\n\"Any signs, Oscar, of Herr Grosse?\" she asked.\n\n\"Yes. His chaise has been seen on the road. He will be here directly.\"\n\nGiving that answer, and passing by my chair to place himself on the other\nside of Lucilla, Oscar cast at me one imploring look--a look which said\nplainly, \"Don't desert me when the time comes!\" I nodded my head to show\nthat I understood him and felt for him. He sat down in the vacant chair\nby Lucilla, and took her hand in silence. It was hard to say which of the\ntwo felt the position, at that trying moment, most painfully. I don't\nthink I ever saw any sight so simply and irresistibly touching as the\nsight of those two poor young creatures sitting hand in hand, waiting the\nevent which was to make the happiness or the misery of their future\nlives.\n\n\"Have you seen anything of your brother?\" I asked, putting the question\nin as careless a tone as my devouring anxiety would allow me to assume.\n\n\"Nugent has gone to meet Herr Grosse.\"\n\nOscar's eyes once more encountered mine, as he replied in those terms; I\nsaw again the imploring look more marked in them than ever. It was plain\nto him, as it was plain to me, that Nugent had gone to meet the German,\nwith the purpose of making Herr Grosse the innocent means of bringing him\ninto the house.\n\nBefore I could speak again, Mr. Finch, recovering himself after the\ninterruption which had silenced him, saw his opportunity of setting in\nfor another harangue. Mrs. Finch had left off sobbing; the baby had left\noff screaming; the rest of us were silent and nervous. In a word, Mr.\nFinch's domestic congregation was entirely at Mr. Finch's mercy. He\nstrutted up to Oscar's chair. Was he going to propose to read _Hamlet?_\nNo! He was going to invoke a blessing on Oscar's head.\n\n\"On this interesting occasion,\" began the rector in his pulpit tones;\n\"now that we are all united in the same room, all animated by the same\nhope--I could wish, as pastor and parent (God bless you, Oscar: I look on\nyou as a son. Mrs. Finch, follow my example, look on him as a son!)--I\ncould wish, as pastor and parent, to say a few pious and consoling\nwords----\"\n\nThe door--the friendly, admirable, judicious door--stopped the coming\nsermon, in the nick of time, by opening again. Herr Grosse's squat figure\nand owlish spectacles appeared on the threshold. And behind him (exactly\nas I had anticipated) stood Nugent Dubourg.\n\nLucilla turned deadly pale: she had heard the door open, she knew by\ninstinct that the surgeon had come. Oscar got up, stole behind my chair,\nand whispered to me, \"For God's sake, get Nugent out of the room!\" I gave\nhim a reassuring squeeze of the hand, and, putting Jicks down on the\nfloor, rose to welcome our good Grosse.\n\nThe child, as it happened, was beforehand with me. She and the\nillustrious oculist had met in the garden at one of the German's\nprofessional visits to Lucilla, and had taken an amazing fancy to each\nother. Herr Grosse never afterwards appeared at the rectory without some\nunwholesome eatable thing in his pocket for Jicks; who gave him in return\nas many kisses as he might ask for, and further distinguished him as the\nonly living creature whom she permitted to nurse the disreputable doll.\nGrasping this same doll now, with both hands, and using it head-foremost,\nas a kind of battering-ram, Jicks plunged in front of me, and butted with\nall her might at the surgeon's bandy legs; insisting on a monopoly of his\nattention before he presumed to speak to any other person in the room.\nWhile he was lifting her to a level with his face, and talking to her in\nhis wonderful broken English--while the rector and Mrs. Finch were making\nthe necessary apologies for the child's conduct--Nugent came round from\nbehind Herr Grosse, and drew me mysteriously into a corner of the room.\nAs I followed him, I saw the silent torture of anxiety expressed in\nOscar's face as he stood by Lucilla's chair. It did me good; it strung up\nmy resolution to the right pitch; it made me feel myself a match, and\nmore than a match, for Nugent Dubourg.\n\n\"I am afraid I behaved in a very odd manner, when we met in the village?\"\nhe said. \"The fact is, I am not at all well. I have been in a strange\nfeverish state lately. I don't think the air of this place suits me.\"\nThere he stopped; keeping his eyes steadily fixed on mine, trying to read\nmy mind in my face.\n\n\"I am not surprised to hear you say that,\" I answered. \"I have noticed\nthat you have not been looking well lately.\"\n\nMy tone and manner (otherwise perfectly composed) expressed polite\nsympathy--and nothing more. I saw I puzzled him. He tried again.\n\n\"I hope I didn't say or do anything rude?\" he went on.\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\n\"I was excited--painfully excited. You are too kind to admit it; I am\nsure I owe you my apologies?\"\n\n\"No, indeed! you were certainly excited, as you say. But we are all in\nthe same state to-day. The occasion, Mr. Nugent, is your sufficient\napology.\"\n\nNot the slightest sign in my face of any sort of suspicion of him\nrewarded the close and continued scrutiny with which he regarded me. I\nsaw in his perplexed expression, the certain assurance that I was beating\nhim at his own weapons. He made a last effort to entrap me into revealing\nthat I suspected his secret--he attempted, by irritating my quick temper,\nto take me by surprise.\n\n\"You are no doubt astonished at seeing me here,\" he resumed. \"I have not\nforgotten that I promised to remain at Browndown instead of coming to the\nrectory. Don't be angry with me: I am under medical orders which forbid\nme to keep my promise.\"\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" I said just as coolly as ever.\n\n\"I will explain myself,\" he rejoined. \"You remember that we long since\ntook Grosse into our confidence, on the subject of Oscar's position\ntowards Lucilla?\"\n\n\"I am not likely to have forgotten it,\" I answered, \"considering that it\nwas I who first warned your brother that Herr Grosse might do terrible\nmischief by innocently letting out the truth.\"\n\n\"Do you recollect how Grosse took the warning when we gave it to him?\"\n\n\"Perfectly. He promised to be careful. But, at the same time, he gruffly\nforbade us to involve him in any more of our family troubles. He said he\nwas determined to preserve his professional freedom of action, without\nbeing hampered by domestic difficulties which might concern _us,_ but\nwhich did not concern _him._ Is my memory accurate enough to satisfy\nyou?\"\n\n\"Your memory is wonderful. You will now understand me when I tell you\nthat Grosse asserts his professional freedom of action on this occasion.\nI had it from his own lips on our way here. He considers it very\nimportant that Lucilla should not be frightened at the moment when she\ntries her sight. Oscar's face is sure to startle her, if it is the first\nface she sees. Grosse has accordingly requested me to be present (as the\nonly other young man in the room), and to place myself so that I shall be\nthe first person who attracts her notice. Ask him yourself, Madame\nPratolungo, if you don't believe me.\"\n\n\"Of course I believe you!\" I answered. \"It is useless to dispute the\nsurgeon's orders at such a time as this.\"\n\nWith that, I left him; showing just as much annoyance as an unsuspecting\nwoman, in my position, might have naturally betrayed--and no more.\nKnowing, as I did, what was going on under the surface, I understood only\ntoo plainly what had happened. Nugent had caught at the opportunity which\nthe surgeon had innocently offered to him, as a means of misleading\nLucilla at the moment, and (possibly) of taking some base advantage of\nher afterwards. I trembled inwardly with rage and fear, as I turned my\nback on him. Our one chance was to make sure of his absence, at the\ncritical moment--and, cudgel my brains as I might, how to reach that end\nsuccessfully was more than I could see.\n\nWhen I returned to the other persons in the room, Oscar and Lucilla were\nstill occupying the same positions. Mr. Finch had presented himself (at\nfull length) to Herr Grosse. And Jicks was established on a stool in a\ncorner: devouring a rampant horse, carved in bilious-yellow German\ngingerbread, with a voracious relish wonderful and terrible to see.\n\n\"Ah, my goot Madame Pratolungo!\" said Herr Grosse, stopping on his way to\nLucilla to shake hands with me. \"Have you made anodder lofely Mayonnaise?\nI have come on purpose with an empty-stomachs, and a wolf's-appetite in\nfine order. Look at that little Imps,\" he went on, pointing to Jicks.\n\"Ach Gott! I believe I am in lofe with her. I have sent all the ways to\nGermany for gingerbreads for Jick. Aha, you Jick! does it stick in your\ntooths? Is it nice-clammy-sweet?\" He glared benevolently at the child\nthrough his spectacles; and tucked my hand sentimentally into the breast\nof his waistcoat. \"Promise me a child like adorable Jick,\" he said\nsolemnly, \"I will marry the first wife you bring me--nice womans, nasty\nwomans, I don't care which. Soh! there is my domestic sentiments laid\nbare before you. Enough of that. Now for my pretty-Feench!\nCome-begin-begin!\"\n\nHe crossed the room to Lucilla, and called to Nugent to follow him.\n\n\"Open the shutters,\" he said. \"Light-light-light, and plenty of him, for\nmy lofely Feench!\"\n\nNugent opened the shutters, beginning with the lower window, and ending\nwith the window at which Lucilla was sitting. Acting on this plan, he had\nonly to wait where he was, to place himself close by her--to be the first\nobject she saw. He did it. The villain did it. I stepped forward,\ndetermined to interfere--and stopped, not knowing what to say or do. I\ncould have beaten my own stupid brains out against the wall. There stood\nNugent right before her, as the surgeon turned his patient towards the\nwindow. And not the ghost of an idea came to me!\n\nThe German stretched out his hairy hands, and took hold of the knot of\nthe bandage to undo it.\n\nLucilla trembled from head to foot.\n\nHerr Grosse hesitated--looked at her--let go of the bandage-and lifting\none of her hands, laid his fingers on her pulse.\n\nIn the moment of silence that followed, I had one of my inspirations. The\nmissing idea turned up in my brains at last.\n\n\"Soh!\" cried Grosse, dropping her hand with a sudden outbreak of\nannoyance and surprise. \"Who has been frightening my pretty Feench? Why\nthese cold trembles? these sinking pulses? Some of you tell me--what does\nit mean?\"\n\nHere was my opportunity! I tried my idea on the spot.\n\n\"It means,\" I said, \"that there are too many people in this room. We\nconfuse her, and frighten her. Take her into her bedroom, Herr Grosse;\nand only let the rest of us in, when you think right--one at a time.\"\n\nOur excellent surgeon instantly seized on my idea, and made it his own.\n\n\"You are a phenix among womens,\" he said, paternally patting me on the\nshoulder. \"Which is most perfectest, your advice or your Mayonnaise, I am\nat a loss to know.\" He turned to Lucilla, and raised her gently from her\nchair. \"Come into your own rooms with me, my poor little Feench. I shall\nsee if I dare take off your bandages to-day.\"\n\nLucilla clasped her hands entreatingly.\n\n\"You promised!\" she said. \"Oh, Herr Grosse, you promised to let me use my\neyes to-day!\"\n\n\"Answer me this!\" retorted the German. \"Did I know, when I promised, that\nI should find you all shaky-pale, as white as my shirts when he comes\nback from the wash?\"\n\n\"I am quite myself again,\" she pleaded faintly. \"I am quite fit to have\nthe bandage taken off.\"\n\n\"What! you know better than I do? Which of us is surgeon-optic--you or\nme? No more of this. Come under my arms! Come into the odder rooms!\"\n\nHe put her arm in his, and walked with her to the door. There, her\nvariable humour suddenly changed. She rallied on the instant. Her face\nflushed; her courage came back. To my horror, she snatched her arm away\nfrom the surgeon, and refused to leave the room.\n\n\"No!\" she said. \"I am quite composed again; I claim your promise. Examine\nme here. I must and will have my first look at Oscar in this room.\"\n\n(I was afraid--literally afraid--to turn my eyes Oscar's way. I glanced\nat Nugent instead. There was a devilish smile on his face that it nearly\ndrove me mad to see.)\n\n\"You must and weel?\" repeated Grosse. \"Now, mind!\" He took out his watch.\n\"I give you one little minutes, to think in. If you don't come with me in\nthat time, you shall find it is I who must and weel. Now!\"\n\n\"Why do you object to go into your room?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because I want everybody to see me,\" she answered. \"How many of you are\nthere here?\"\n\n\"There are five of us. Mr. and Mrs. Finch; Mr. Nugent Dubourg; Oscar, and\nmyself.\"\n\n\"I wish there were five hundred of you, instead of five?\" she burst out.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"Because you would see me pick out Oscar from all the rest, the instant\nthe bandage was off my eyes!\"\n\nStill holding to her own fatal conviction that the image in her mind of\nOscar was the right one! For the second time, though I felt the longing\nin me to look at him, I shrank from doing it.\n\nHerr Grosse put his watch back in his pocket.\n\n\"The minutes is passed,\" he said. \"Will you come into the odder rooms?\nWill you understand that I cannot properly examine you before all these\npeoples? Say, my lofely Feench--Yes? or No?\"\n\n\"No!\" she cried obstinately, with a childish stamp of her foot. \"I insist\non showing everybody that I can pick out Oscar, the moment I open my\neyes.\"\n\nHerr Grosse buttoned his coat, settled his owlish spectacles firmly on\nhis nose, and took up his hat. \"Goot morning,\" he said. \"I have nothing\nmore to do with you or your eyes. Cure yourself, you\nlittle-spitfire-Feench. I am going back to London.\"\n\nHe opened the door. Even Lucilla was obliged to yield, when the surgeon\nin attendance on her threatened to throw up the case.\n\n\"You brute!\" she said indignantly--and took his arm again.\n\nGrosse indulged himself in his diabolical grin. \"Wait till you are able\nto use your eyes, my lofe. Then you will see what a brutes I am!\" With\nthose words he took her out.\n\nWe were left in the sitting-room, to wait until the surgeon had decided\nwhether he would, or would not, let Lucilla try her sight on that day.\n\nWhile the others were, in their various ways, all suffering the same\nuneasy sense of expectation, I was as quiet in my mind as the baby now\nsleeping in his mother's arms. Thanks to Grosse's resolution to act on\nthe hint that I had given to him, I had now made it impossible--even if\nthe bandage was removed on that day--for Nugent to catch Lucilla's first\nlook when she opened her eyes. Her betrothed husband might certainly, on\nsuch a special occasion as this, be admitted into her bed-chamber, in\ncompany with her father or with me. But the commonest sense of propriety\nwould dictate the closing of the door on Nugent. In the sitting-room he\nmust wait (if he still persisted in remaining at the rectory) until she\nwas allowed to join him there. I privately resolved, having the control\nof the matter in my own hands, that this should not happen until Lucilla\nknew which of the twins was Nugent, and which was Oscar. A delicious\ninward glow of triumph diffused itself all through me. I resisted the\nstrong temptation that I felt to discover how Nugent bore his defeat. If\nI had yielded to it, he would have seen in my face that I gloried in\nhaving outwitted him. I sat down, the picture of innocence, in the\nnearest chair, and crossed my hands on my lap, a composed and ladylike\nperson, edifying to see.\n\nThe slow minutes followed each other--and still we waited the event in\nsilence. Even Mr. Finch's tongue was, on this solitary occasion, a tongue\nincapable of pronouncing a single word. He sat by his wife at one end of\nthe room. Oscar and I were at the other. Nugent stood by himself at one\nof the windows, deep in his own thoughts, plotting how he could pay me\nout.\n\nOscar was the first of the party who broke the silence. After looking all\nround the room, he suddenly addressed himself to me.\n\n\"Madame Pratolungo!\" he exclaimed. \"What has become of Jicks?\"\n\nI had completely forgotten the child. I too looked round the room, and\nsatisfied myself that she had really disappeared. Mrs. Finch, observing\nour astonishment, timidly enlightened us. The maternal eye had seen Jicks\nslip out cunningly at Herr Grosse's heels. The child's object was plain\nenough. While there was any probability of the presence of more\ngingerbread in the surgeon's pocket, the wandering Arab of the family (as\nstealthy and as quick as a cat) was certain to keep within reach of her\nfriend. Nobody who knew her could doubt that she had stolen into\nLucilla's bed-chamber, under cover of Herr Grosse's ample coat-tails.\n\nWe had just accounted in this way for the mysterious absence of Jicks,\nwhen we heard the bed-chamber door opened, and the surgeon's voice\ncalling for Zillah. In a minute more the nurse appeared, the bearer of a\nmessage from the next room.\n\nWe all surrounded her, with one and the same question to ask. What had\nHerr Grosse decided to do? The answer informed us that he had decided on\nforbidding Lucilla to try her eyes that day.\n\n\"Is she very much disappointed?\" Oscar inquired anxiously.\n\n\"I can hardly say, sir. She isn't like herself. I never knew Miss Lucilla\nso quiet when she was crossed in her wishes, before. When the doctor\ncalled me into the room, she said: 'Go in, Zillah, and tell them.' Those\nwords, sir, and no more.\"\n\n\"Did she express no wish to see me?\" I inquired.\n\n\"No, ma'am. I took the liberty of asking her if she wished to see you.\nMiss Lucilla shook her head, and sat herself down on the sofa, and made\nthe doctor sit by her. 'Leave us by ourselves.' Those were the last words\nshe said to me, before I came in here.\"\n\nReverend Finch put the next question. The Pope of Dimchurch was himself\nagain: the man of many words saw his chance of speaking once more.\n\n\"Good woman,\" said the rector with ponderous politeness, \"step this way.\nI wish to address an inquiry to you. Did Miss Finch make any remark, in\nyour hearing, indicating a desire to be comforted by My Ministrations--as\none bearing the double relation towards her of pastor and parent?\"\n\n\"I didn't hear Miss Lucilla say anything to that effect, sir.\"\n\nMr. Finch waved his hand with a look of disgust, intimating that Zillah's\naudience was over. Nugent, upon that, came forward, and stopped her as\nshe was leaving the room.\n\n\"Have you nothing more to tell us?\" he asked.\n\n\"No, sir.\"\n\n\"Why don't they come back here? What are they doing in the other room?\"\n\n\"They were doing what I mentioned just now, sir--they were sitting side\nby side on the sofa. Miss Lucilla was talking, and the doctor was\nlistening to her. And Jicks,\" added Zillah, addressing herself\nconfidentially to me, \"was behind them, picking the doctor's pocket.\"\n\nOscar put in a word there--by no means in his most gracious manner.\n\n\"What was Miss Lucilla saying to the doctor?\"\n\n\"I don't know, sir.\"\n\n\"You don't know?\"\n\n\"I couldn't hear, sir. Miss Lucilla was speaking to him in a whisper.\"\n\nAfter that, there was no more to be said. Zillah--disturbed over her\ndomestic occupations and eager to get back to her kitchen--seized the\nfirst chance of leaving the room; going out in such a hurry that she\nforgot to close the door after her. We all looked at each other. To what\nconclusion did the nurse's strange answers point? It was plainly\nimpossible for Oscar (no matter how quick his temper might be) to feel\njealous of a man of Grosse's age and personal appearance. Still, the\nprolonged interview between patient and surgeon--after the decision had\nbeen pronounced and the trial of the eyes definitely deferred to a future\nday--had a strange appearance, to say the least of it.\n\nNugent returned to his place at the window--puzzled, suspicious, deep in\nhis own thoughts. Reverend Finch, swelling with unspoken words, rose\nportentously from his chair by his wife's side. Had he discovered another\nchance of inflicting his eloquence on us? It was only too evident that he\nhad! He looked at us with his ominous smile. He addressed us in his\nbiggest voice.\n\n\"My Christian friends----\"\n\nNugent, unassailable by eloquence, persisted in looking out of the\nwindow. Oscar, insensible to every earthly consideration except the one\nconsideration of Lucilla, drew me aside unceremoniously out of the\nrector's hearing. Mr. Finch resumed.\n\n\"My Christian friends, I could wish to say a few appropriate words.\"\n\n\"Go to Lucilla!\" whispered Oscar, taking me entreatingly by both hands.\n\"_You_ needn't stand on ceremony with her. Do, do see what is going on in\nthe next room!\"\n\nMr. Finch resumed.\n\n\"The occasion seems to call upon one in my position for a little\nsustaining advice on Christian duty--I would say, the duty of being\ncheerful under disappointment.\"\n\nOscar persisted.\n\n\"Do me the greatest of all favors! Pray find out what is keeping Lucilla\nwith that man!\"\n\nMr. Finch cleared his throat, and lifted his right hand persuasively by\nway of introduction to his next sentence.\n\nI answered Oscar in a whisper.\n\n\"I don't like intruding on them. Lucilla told the nurse they were to be\nleft by themselves.\"\n\nJust as I said the words, I became aware of a sudden bump against me from\nbehind. I turned, and discovered Jicks with the battering-ram-doll,\npreparing for a second plunge at me. She stopped, when she found that she\nhad attracted my attention; and, taking hold of my dress, tried to pull\nme out of the room.\n\n\"Remove that child!\" cried the rector, exasperated by this new\ninterruption.\n\nThe child pulled harder and harder at my dress. Something had apparently\nhappened outside the sitting-room which had produced a strong impression\non her. Her little round face was flushed; her bright blue eyes were wide\nopen and staring. \"Jicks wants to speak to you,\" she said--and pulled at\nme impatiently harder than ever.\n\nI stooped down with the double purpose of obeying Mr. Finch's commands\nand of humouring the child's whim, by carrying Jicks out of the room,\nwhen I was startled by a sound from the bed-chamber--the sound, loud and\nperemptory, of Lucilla's voice.\n\n\"Let go of me!\" she cried. \"I am a woman--I won't be treated like a\nchild.\"\n\nThere was a moment of silence--followed by the rustling sound of her\ndress, approaching us along the corridor.\n\nGrosse's voice--unmistakably angry and excited--became audible at the\nsame time. \"No! Come back! come back!\"\n\nThe rustling sound of the dress came nearer.\n\nNugent and Mr. Finch moved together closer to the door. Oscar caught me\nby the arm. He and I were on the left-hand side of the door: Nugent and\nthe rector were on the right-hand side. It all happened with the\nsuddenness of a flash of lightning. My heart stood still. I couldn't\nspeak. I couldn't move.\n\nThe half-closed door of the sitting-room was burst wide open--roughly,\nviolently, as if a man, not a woman, had been on the other side. (The\nrector drew back; Nugent remained where he was.) Wildly groping her way\nwith outstretched arms, as I had never seen her grope it in the time of\nher blindness, Lucilla staggered into the room. Merciful God! the bandage\nwas off. The life, the new life of sight, was in her eyes. It\ntransfigured her face: it irradiated her beauty with an awful and\nunearthly light. She saw! she saw!\n\nFor an instant she stopped at the door, swaying to and fro; giddy under\nthe broad stare of daylight.\n\nShe looked at the rector--then at Mrs. Finch, who had followed her\nhusband. She paused bewildered, and put her hands over her eyes. She\nslightly changed her position; turned her head, as if to look at me;\nturned it back sharply towards the right-hand side of the door again; and\nthrew up her arms in the air, with a burst of hysterical laughter. The\nlaughter ended in a scream of triumph, which rang through the house. She\nrushed at Nugent Dubourg, so blindly incapable of measuring her distance\nthat she struck against him violently, and nearly threw him down. \"I know\nhim! I know him!\" she cried--and flung her arms round his neck. \"Oh,\nOscar! Oscar!\" She clasped him to her with all her strength as the name\npassed her lips, and dropped her head on his bosom in an ecstasy of joy.\n\nIt was done before any of us had recovered the use of our senses. The\nwhole horrible scene must have begun and ended in less than half a minute\nof time. The surgeon, who had run into the room after her, empty-handed,\nturned suddenly, and left it again; coming back with the bandage, left\nforgotten in the bed-room. Grosse was the first among us to recover his\npresence of mind. He approached her in silence.\n\nShe heard him, before he could take her by surprise, and slip the bandage\nover her eyes. The moment when I turned, horror-struck, to look at Oscar,\nwas also the moment when she lifted her head from Nugent's bosom to look\nfor the surgeon. Her eyes followed the direction taken by mine. They\nencountered Oscar's face. She saw the blue-black hue of it in full light.\n\nA cry of terror escaped her: she started back, shuddering, and caught\nhold of Nugent's arm. Grosse motioned sternly to him to turn her face\nfrom the window; and lifted the bandage. She clutched at it with feverish\neagerness as he held it up. \"Put it on again!\" she said, holding by\nNugent with one hand, and lifting the other to point towards Oscar with a\ngesture of disgust. \"Put it on again. I have seen too much already.\"\n\nGrosse fastened the bandage over her eyes, and waited a little. She still\nheld Nugent's arm. The sting of my indignation as I saw it, roused me\ninto doing something. I stepped forward to part them. Grosse stopped me.\n\"No!\" he said. \"Don't make bad worse.\" I looked at Oscar for the second\ntime. There he stood, as he had stood from the first moment when she\nappeared at the door--his eyes staring wildly straight before him; his\nlimbs set and fixed. I went to him, and touched him. He seemed not to\nfeel it. I spoke to him. I might as well have spoken to a man of stone.\n\nGrosse's voice drew my attention, for a moment, the other way.\n\n\"Come!\" he said, trying to take Lucilla back into her own room.\n\nShe shook her head, and tightened her hold on Nugent's arm.\n\n\"_You_ take me,\" she whispered. \"As far as the door.\"\n\nI again attempted to stop it; and again the German put me back.\n\n\"Not to-day!\" he said sternly. With that, he made a sign to Nugent, and\nplaced himself on Lucilla's other side. In silence, the two men led her\nout of the room. The door closed on them. It was over.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-SIXTH\n\nThe Brothers Meet\n\nA FAINT sound of crying found its way to my ears from the lower end of\nthe room, and reminded me that the rector and his wife had been present\namong us. Feeble Mrs. Finch was lying back in her chair, weeping and\nwailing over what had happened. Her husband, with the baby in his arms,\nwas trying to compose her. I ought perhaps to have offered my help--but,\nI own, poor Mrs. Finch's distress produced only a passing impression on\nme. My whole heart was with another person. I forgot the rector and his\nwife, and went back to Oscar.\n\nThis time he moved--he lifted his head when he saw me. Shall I ever\nforget the silent misery in that face, the dull dreadful stare in those\ntearless eyes?\n\nI took his hand--I felt for the poor disfigured, rejected man as his\nmother might have felt for him--I gave him a mother's kiss. \"Be\ncomforted, Oscar,\" I said. \"Trust me to set this right.\"\n\nHe drew a long trembling breath, and pressed my hand gratefully. I\nattempted to speak to him again--he stopped me by looking suddenly\ntowards the door.\n\n\"Is Nugent outside?\" he asked in a whisper.\n\nI went into the corridor. It was empty. I looked into Lucilla's room. She\nand Grosse and the nurse were the only persons in it. I beckoned to\nZillah to come out and speak to me. I asked for Nugent. He had left\nLucilla abruptly at the bed-room door--he was out of the house. I\ninquired if it was known in what direction he had gone. Zillah had seen\nhim in the field at the end of the garden, walking away rapidly, with his\nback to the village, and his face to the hills.\n\n\"Nugent has gone,\" I said, returning to Oscar.\n\n\"Add to your kindness to me,\" he answered. \"Let _me_ go too.\"\n\nA quick fear crossed my mind, that he might be bent on following his\nbrother.\n\n\"Wait a little,\" I said, \"and rest here.\"\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"I must be by myself,\" he said. After considering a little, he added a\nquestion. \"Has Nugent gone to Browndown?\"\n\n\"No. Nugent has been seen walking towards the hills.\"\n\nHe took my hand again. \"Be merciful to me,\" he said. \"Let me go.\"\n\n\"Home? To Browndown?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Let me go with you.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Forgive me. You shall hear from me later in the day.\"\n\nNo tears! no flaming-up of the quick temper that I knew so well! Nothing\nin his face, nothing in his voice, nothing in his manner, but a composure\nmiserable to see--the composure of despair.\n\n\"At least, let me accompany you to the gate,\" I said.\n\n\"God bless and reward you!\" he answered. \"Let me go.\"\n\nWith a gentle hand--and yet with a firmness which took me completely by\nsurprise--he separated himself from me, and went out.\n\nI could stand no longer--I dropped trembling into a chair. The conviction\nforced itself on me that there were worse complications, direr\nmisfortunes, still to come. I was almost beside myself--I broke out\nvehemently with wild words spoken in my own language. Mrs. Finch recalled\nme to my senses. I saw her as in a dream, drying her tears, and looking\nat me in alarm. The rector approached, with profuse expressions of\nsympathy and offers of assistance. I wanted no comforting. I had served a\nhard apprenticeship to life; I had been well seasoned to trouble. \"Thank\nyou, sir,\" I said. \"Look to Mrs. Finch.\" There was more air in the\ncorridor. I went out again, to walk about, and get the better of it\nthere.\n\nA small object attracted my attention, crouched up on one of the window\nseats. The small object was--Jicks.\n\nI suppose the child's instinct must have told her that something had gone\nwrong. She looked furtively sideways at me, round her doll: she had grave\ndoubts of my intentions towards her. \"Are you going to whack Jicks?\"\nasked the curious little creature, shrinking into her corner. I sat down\nby her, and soon recovered my place in her confidence. She began to\nchatter again as fast as usual. I listened to her as I could have\nlistened to no grown-up person at that moment. In some mysterious way\nthat I cannot explain, the child comforted me. Little by little, I learnt\nwhat she had wanted with me, when she had attempted to drag me out of the\nroom. She had seen all that had passed in the bed-chamber; and she had\nrun out to take me back with her, and show me the wonderful sight of\nLucilla with the bandage off her eyes. If I had been wise enough to\nlisten to Jicks, I might have prevented the catastrophe that had\nhappened. I might have met Lucilla in the corridor, and have forced her\nback into her own room and turned the key on her.\n\nIt was too late now to regret what had happened. \"Jicks has been good,\" I\nsaid, patting my little friend on the head with a heavy heart. The child\nlistened--considered with herself gravely--got off the window-seat--and\nclaimed her reward for being good, with that excellent brevity of speech\nwhich so eminently distinguished her:\n\n\"Jicks will go out.\"\n\nWith those words, she shouldered her doll; and walked off. The last I saw\nof her, she was descending the stairs as a workman descends a ladder, on\nher way to the garden--and from the garden (the first time the gate was\nopened) to the hills. If I could have gone out with her light heart, I\nwould have joined Jicks.\n\nI had hardly lost sight of the child, before the door of Lucilla's room\nopened, and Herr Grosse appeared in the corridor.\n\n\"Soh!\" he muttered with a gesture of relief, \"the very womans I was\nlooking for. A nice mess-fix we are in now! I must stop with Feench. (I\nshall end in hating Feench!) Can you put me into a beds for the night?\"\n\nI assured him that he could easily sleep at the rectory. In answer to my\ninquiries after his patient, he gravely acknowledged that he was anxious\nabout Lucilla. The varying and violent emotions which had shaken her\n(acting through her nervous system) might produce results which would\nimperil the recovery of her sight. Absolute repose was not simply\nnecessary--it was now the only chance for her. For the next\nfour-and-twenty hours, he must keep watch over her eyes. At the end of\nthat time--no earlier--he might be able to say whether the mischief done\nwould be fatal to her sight or not. I asked how she had contrived to get\nher bandage off, and to make her fatal entrance into the sitting-room.\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. \"There are times,\" he said cynically, \"when\nevery womans is a hussy, and every mans is a fool. This was one of the\ntimes.\"\n\nIt appeared, on further explanation, that my poor Lucilla had pleaded so\nearnestly (after the nurse had left the room) to be allowed to try her\neyes, and had shown such ungovernable disappointment when he persisted in\nsaying No, that he had yielded--not so much to her entreaties, as to his\nown conviction that it would be less dangerous to humour her than to\nthwart her, with such a sensitive and irritable temperament as hers. He\nhad first bargained however, on his side, that she should remain in the\nbed-chamber, and be content, for that time, with using her sight on the\nobjects round her in the room. She had promised all that he asked--and he\nhad been foolish enough to trust to her promise. The bandage once off,\nshe had instantly set every consideration at defiance--had torn herself\nout of his hands like a mad creature--and had rushed into the\nsitting-room before he could stop her. The rest had followed as a matter\nof course. Feeble as it was at the first trial of it, her sense of sight\nwas sufficiently restored to enable her to distinguish objects dimly. Of\nthe three persons who had offered themselves to view on the right-hand\nside of the door, one (Mrs. Finch) was a woman; another (Mr. Finch) was a\nshort, grey-headed, elderly man; the third (Nugent), in his height--which\nshe could see--and in the color of his hair--which she could see-was the\nonly one of the three who could possibly represent Oscar. The catastrophe\nthat followed was (as things were) inevitable. Now that the harm was\ndone, the one alternative left was to check the mischief at the point\nwhich it had already reached. Not the slightest hint at the terrible\nmistake that she had made must be suffered to reach her ears. If we any\nof us said one word about it before he authorized us to do so, he would\nrefuse to answer for the consequences, and would then and there throw up\nthe case.\n\nSo, in his broken English, Herr Grosse explained what had happened, and\nissued his directions for our future conduct.\n\n\"No person is to go into her,\" he said, in conclusion, \"but you and goot\nMrs. Zillahs. You two watch her, turn-about-turn-about. In a whiles, she\nwill sleep. For me, I go to smoke my tobaccos in the garden. Hear this,\nMadame Pratolungo. When Gott made the womens, he was sorry afterwards for\nthe poor mens--and he made tobaccos to comfort them.\"\n\nFavoring me with this peculiar view of the scheme of creation, Herr\nGrosse shook his shock head, and waddled away to the garden.\n\nI softly opened the bed-room door, and looked in--disappearing just in\ntime to escape the rector and Mrs. Finch returning to their own side of\nthe house.\n\nLucilla was lying on the sofa. She asked who it was in a drowsy\nvoice--she was happily just sinking into slumber. Zillah occupied a chair\nnear her. I was not wanted for the moment--and I was glad, for the first\ntime in my experience at Dimchurch, to get out of the room again. By some\ncontradiction in my character which I am not able to explain, there was a\ncertain hostile influence in the sympathy that I felt for Oscar, which\nestranged me, for the moment, from Lucilla. It was not her fault--and yet\n(I am ashamed to own it) I almost felt angry with her for reposing so\ncomfortably, when I thought of the poor fellow, without a creature to say\na kind word to him, alone at Browndown.\n\nOut again in the corridor, the question faced me:--What was I to do next?\n\nThe loneliness of the house was insupportable; my anxiety about Oscar\ngrew more than I could endure. I put on my hat, and went out.\n\nHaving no desire to interfere with Herr Grosse's enjoyment of his pipe, I\nmade my way through the garden as quickly as possible, and found myself\nin the village again. My uneasiness on the subject of Oscar, was matched\nby my angry desire to know what Nugent would do. Now that he had worked\nthe very mischief which his brother had foreseen to be possible--the very\nmischief which it had been Oscar's one object to prevent in asking him to\nleave Dimchurch--would he take his departure? would he rid us, at once\nand for ever, of the sight of him? The bare idea of the other\nalternative--I mean, of his remaining in the place--shook me with such an\nunutterable dread of what might happen next, that my feet refused to\nsupport me. I was obliged, just beyond the village, to sit down by the\nroad-side, and wait till my giddy head steadied itself before I attempted\nto move again.\n\nAfter a minute or two, I heard footsteps coming along the road. My heart\ngave one great leap in me. I thought it was Nugent.\n\nA moment more brought the person in view. It was only Mr. Gootheridge of\nthe village inn, on his way home. He stopped, and took off his hat.\n\n\"Tired, ma'am?\" he said.\n\nThe uppermost idea in my mind found its way somehow, ill as I was, to\nexpression on my lips--in the form of a question addressed to the\nlandlord.\n\n\"Do you happen to have seen anything of Mr. Nugent Dubourg?\" I asked.\n\n\"I saw him not five minutes since, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Going into Browndown.\"\n\nI started up, as if I had been struck or shot. Worthy Mr. Gootheridge\nstared. I wished him good-day, and went on as fast as my feet would take\nme, straight to Browndown. Had the brothers met in the house? I turned\ncold at the bare thought of it--but I still kept on. There was an\nobstinate resolution in me to part them, which served me in place of\ncourage. Account for it as you may, I was bold and frightened both at the\nsame time. At one moment, I was fool enough to say to myself, \"They will\nkill me.\" At another, just as foolishly, I found comfort in the opposite\nview. \"Bah! They are gentlemen; they can't hurt a woman!\"\n\nThe servant was standing idling at the front door, when I arrived in\nsight of the house. This, in itself, was unusual. He was a hard-working\nwell-trained man. On other occasions, nobody had ever seen him out of his\nproper place. He advanced a few steps to meet me. I looked at him\ncarefully. Not the slightest appearance of disturbance was visible in his\nface.\n\n\"Is Mr. Oscar at home?\" I asked.\n\n\"I beg your pardon, ma'am. Mr. Oscar is at home--but you can't see him.\nHe and Mr. Nugent are together.\"\n\nI rested my hand on the low wall in front of the house, and made a\ndesperate effort to put a calm face on it.\n\n\"Surely Mr. Oscar will see _me?_\" I said.\n\n\"I have Mr. Oscar's orders, ma'am, to wait at the door, and tell\neverybody who comes to the house (without exception) that he is engaged.\"\n\nThe house-door was half open. I listened intently while the man was\nspeaking. If they had been at high words together, I must have heard them\nin the silence of the lonely hills all round us. I heard nothing.\n\nIt was strange, it was inconceivable. At the same time it relieved me.\nThere they were together, and no harm had come of it, so far.\n\nI left my card--and walked on a little, past the corner of the house\nwall. As soon as I was out of the servant's sight, I turned back to the\nside of the building, and ventured as near as I durst to the window of\nthe sitting-room. Their voices reached me, but not their words. On both\nsides, the tones were low and confidential. Not a note of anger in either\nvoice--listen for it as I might! I left the house again, breathless with\namazement, and (so rapidly does a woman shift from one emotion to\nanother) burning with curiosity.\n\nAfter half an hour of aimless wandering in the valley, I returned to the\nrectory.\n\nLucilla was still sleeping. I took Zillah's place, and sent her into the\nkitchen. The landlady of the inn was there to help us with the dinner.\nBut she was hardly equal, single-handed, to the superintendence of such\ndishes as we had to set before Herr Grosse. It was high time I relieved\nZillah if we were to pass successfully through the ordeal of the great\nsurgeon's criticism, as reviewer of all the sauces.\n\nAn hour more passed before Lucilla woke. I sent a messenger to Grosse,\nwho appeared enveloped in a halo of tobacco, examined the patient's eyes,\nfelt her pulse, ordered her wine and jelly, filled his monstrous pipe,\nand gruffly returned to his promenade in the garden.\n\nThe day wore on. Mr. Finch came to make inquiries, and then went back to\nhis wife--whom he described as \"hysterically irresponsible,\" and in\nimminent need of another warm bath. He declined, in his most pathetic\nmanner, to meet the German at dinner. \"After what I have suffered, after\nwhat I have seen, these banquetings--I would say, these ticklings of the\npalate--are not to my taste. You mean well, Madame Pratolungo. (Good\ncreature!) But I am not in heart for feasting. Simple fare, by my wife's\ncouch; a few consoling words, in the character of pastor and husband,\nwhen the infant is quiet. So my day is laid out. I wish you well. I don't\nobject to your little dinner. Good day! good day!\"\n\nA second examination of Lucilla's eyes brought us to the dinner-hour.\n\nAt the sight of the table-cloth, Herr Grosse's good humour returned. We\ntwo dined together alone--the German sending in selections of his own\nmaking from the dishes to Lucilla's room. So far, he said, she had\nescaped any serious injury. But he still insisted on keeping his patient\nperfectly quiet, and he refused to answer for anything until the night\nhad passed. As for me, Oscar's continued silence weighed more and more\nheavily on my spirits. My past suspense in the darkened room with Lucilla\nseemed to be a mere trifle by comparison with the keener anxieties which\nI suffered now. I saw Grosse's eyes glaring discontentedly at me through\nhis spectacles. He had good reason to look at me as he did--I had never\nbefore been so stupid and so disagreeable in all my life.\n\nTowards the end of the dinner, there came news from Browndown at last.\nThe servant sent in a message by Zillah, begging me to see him for a\nmoment outside the sitting-room door.\n\nI made my excuses to my guest, and hurried out.\n\nThe instant I saw the servant's face, my heart sank. Oscar's kindness had\nattached the man devotedly to his master. I saw his lips tremble, and his\ncolor come and go, when I looked at him.\n\n\"I have brought you a letter, ma'am.\"\n\nHe handed me a letter addressed to me in Oscar's handwriting.\n\n\"How is your master?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not very well, when I saw him last.\"\n\n\"When you saw him last?\"\n\n\"I bring sad news, ma'am. There's a break-up at Browndown.\"\n\n\"What do you mean? Where is Mr. Oscar?\"\n\n\"Mr. Oscar has left Dimchurch.\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-SEVENTH\n\nThe Brothers change Places\n\nI VAINLY believed I had prepared myself for any misfortune that could\nfall on us. The man's last words dispelled my delusion. My gloomiest\nforebodings had never contemplated such a disaster as had now happened. I\nstood petrified, thinking of Lucilla, and looking helplessly at the\nservant. Try as I might, I was perfectly incapable of speaking to him.\n\nHe felt no such difficulty on his side. One of the strangest\npeculiarities in the humbler ranks of the English people, is the sort of\nsolemn relish which they have for talking of their own misfortunes. To be\nthe objects of a calamity of any kind, seems to raise them in their own\nestimations. With a dreary enjoyment of his miserable theme, the servant\nexpatiated on his position as a man deprived of the best of masters;\nturned adrift again in the world to seek another service; hopeless of\never again finding himself in such a situation as he had lost. He roused\nme at last into speaking to him, by sheer dint of irritating my nerves\nuntil I could endure him no longer.\n\n\"Has Mr. Oscar gone away alone?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am, quite alone.\"\n\n(What had become of Nugent? I was too much interested in Oscar to be able\nto put the question, at that moment.)\n\n\"When did your master go?\" I went on.\n\n\"Better than two hours since.\"\n\n\"Why didn't I hear of it before?\"\n\n\"I had Mr. Oscar's orders not to tell you, ma'am, till this time in the\nevening.\"\n\nWretched as I was already, my spirits sank lower still when I heard that.\nThe order given to the servant looked like a premeditated design, not\nonly to leave Dimchurch, but also to keep us in ignorance of his\nwhereabouts afterwards.\n\n\"Has Mr. Oscar gone to London?\" I inquired.\n\n\"He hired Gootheridge's chaise, ma'am, to take him to Brighton. And he\ntold me with his own lips that he had left Browndown never to come back.\nI know no more of it than that.\"\n\nHe had left Browndown, never to come back! For Lucilla's sake, I declined\nto believe that. The servant was exaggerating, or the servant had\nmisunderstood what had been said to him. The letter in my hand reminded\nme that I had perhaps needlessly questioned him on matters which his\nmaster had confided to my own knowledge only. Before I dismissed him for\nthe night, I made my deferred inquiry on the hateful subject of the other\nbrother.\n\n\"Where is Mr. Nugent?\"\n\n\"At Browndown.\"\n\n\"Do you mean to say that he is going to stay at Browndown?\"\n\n\"I don't know, ma'am, for certain. I see no signs of his meaning to\nleave; and he has said nothing to that effect.\"\n\nI had the greatest difficulty to keep myself from breaking out before the\nservant. My indignation almost choked me. The best way was to wish him\ngood night. I took the best way--only calling him back (as a measure of\ncaution) to say one last word.\n\n\"Have you told anybody at the rectory of Mr. Oscar's departure?\" I asked.\n\n\"No, ma'am.\"\n\n\"Say nothing, about it then, as you go out. Thank you for bringing me the\nletter. Good night.\"\n\nHaving thus provided against any whisper of what had happened reaching\nLucilla's ears that evening, I returned to Herr Grosse to make my\nexcuses, and to tell him (as I honestly could) that I was in sore need of\nbeing permitted to retire privately to my own room. I found my\nillustrious guest putting a plate over the final dish of the dinner, full\nof the tenderest anxiety to keep it warm on my account.\n\n\"Here is a lofely cheese-omelets,\" said Grosse. \"Two-thirds of him I have\neaten my own self. The odder third I sweat with anxiety to keep warm for\nyou. Sit down! sit down! Every moment he is getting cold.\"\n\n\"I am much obliged to you, Herr Grosse. I have just heard some miserable\nnews----\"\n\n\"Ach, Gott! don't tell it to me!\" the wretch burst out with a look of\nconsternation. \"No miserable news, I pray you, after such a dinner as I\nhave eaten. Let me do my digestions! My goot-dear-creature, if you lofe\nme let me do my digestions!\"\n\n\"Will you excuse me, if I leave you to your digestion, and retire to my\nown room?\"\n\nHe rose in a violent hurry, and opened the door for me.\n\n\"Yes! yes! From the deep bottoms of my heart I excuse you. Goot Madame\nPratolungo, retire! retire!\"\n\nI had barely passed the threshold, before the door was closed behind me.\nI heard the selfish old brute rub his hands, and chuckle over his success\nin shutting me and my sorrow both out of the room together.\n\nJust as my hand was on my own door, it occurred to me that I should do\nwell to make sure of not being surprised by Lucilla over the reading of\nOscar's letter. The truth is that I shrank from reading it. In spite of\nmy resolution to disbelieve the servant, the dread was now growing on me\nthat the letter would confirm his statement, and would force it on me as\nthe truth that Oscar had left us never to return. I retraced my steps,\nand entered Lucilla's room.\n\nI could just see her, by the dim night-light burning in a corner to\nenable the surgeon or the nurse to find their way to her. She was alone\nin her favorite little wicker-work chair, with the doleful white bandage\nover her eyes--to all appearance quite content, busily knitting!\n\n\"Don't you feel lonely, Lucilla?\"\n\nShe turned her head towards me, and answered in her gayest tones.\n\n\"Not in the least. I am quite happy as I am.\n\n\"Why is Zillah not with you?\"\n\n\"I sent her away.\"\n\n\"You sent her away?\"\n\n\"Yes! I couldn't enjoy myself thoroughly to-night, unless I felt that I\nwas quite alone. I have seen him, my dear--I have seen him! How could you\npossibly think I felt lonely? I am so inordinately happy that I am\nobliged to knit to keep myself quiet. If you say much more, I shall get\nup and dance--I know I shall! Where is Oscar? That odious Grosse--no! it\nis too bad to talk of the dear old man in that way, after he has given me\nback my sight. Still it _is_ cruel of him to say that I am overexcited,\nand to forbid Oscar to come and see me to-night. Is Oscar with you, in\nthe next room? Is he very much disappointed at being parted from me in\nthis way? Say I am thinking of him--since I have seen him--with such new\nthoughts!\"\n\n\"Oscar is not here to-night, my dear.\"\n\n\"No? then he is at Browndown of course with that poor wretched disfigured\nbrother of his. I have got over my terror of Nugent's hideous face. I am\neven beginning (though I never liked him, as you know) to pity him, with\nsuch a dreadful complexion as that. Don't let us talk about it! Don't let\nus talk at all! I want to go on thinking of Oscar.\"\n\nShe resumed her knitting, and shut herself up luxuriously in her own\nhappy thoughts. Knowing what I knew, it was nothing less than\nheart-breaking to see her and hear her. Afraid to trust myself to say\nanother word, I softly closed the door, and charged Zillah (when her\nmistress rang her bell) to say for me that I was weary after the events\nof the day, and had gone to rest in my bed-room.\n\nAt last, I was alone. At last I was at the end of my maneuvers to spare\nmyself the miserable necessity of opening Oscar's letter. After first\nlocking my door, I broke the seal, and read the lines which follow.\n\n\n\n\"KIND AND DEAR FRIEND,--Forgive me: I am going to surprise and distress\nyou. My letter thanks you gratefully; and bids you a last farewell.\n\n\"Summon all your indulgence for me. Read these lines to the end: they\nwill tell you what happened after I left the rectory.\n\n\"Nothing had been seen of Nugent, when I reached this house. It was not\ntill a quarter of an hour later that I heard his voice at the door,\ncalling to me, and asking if I had come back. I answered, and he joined\nme in the sitting-room. Nugent's first words to me were these:--\"\n'Oscar, I have come to ask your pardon, and to bid you good-bye.'\n\n\"I can give you no idea of the tone in which he spoke to me: it would\nhave gone straight to your heart, as it went straight to mine. For the\nmoment, I was not able to answer him. I could only offer him my hand. He\nsighed bitterly, and refused to take it.\n\n\"'I have something still to tell you,' he said. 'Wait till you have\nheard it; and give me your hand afterwards--if you can.'\n\n\"He even refused to take the chair to which I pointed. He distressed me\nby standing in my presence as if he was my inferior. The next words that\nhe said to me--\n\n\"No! I have need of all my calmness and all my courage. It shakes both to\nrecall what he said to me. I sat down to write this, intending to repeat\nto you everything that passed between us. Another of my weaknesses!\nanother of my failures! The tears come into my eyes again, when my mind\nattempts to dwell on the details. I can only tell you the result. My\nbrother's confession may be summed up in three words. Prepare yourself to\nbe startled; prepare yourself to be grieved.\n\n\"Nugent loves her.\n\n\"Think of this discovery falling on me, after I had seen my innocent\nLucilla's arms round his neck--after my own eyes had shown me how she\nrejoiced over her first sight of _him;_ how she shuddered at her first\nsight of _me!_ Need I tell you what I suffered? No.\n\n\"Nugent held out his hand, when he had done--as I had held out mine\nbefore he began.\n\n\"'The one atonement I can make to you and to her,' he said, 'is never to\nlet either of you set eyes on me again. Shake hands, Oscar; and let me\ngo.'\n\n\"If I had willed it so--so it might have ended. I willed it differently.\nIt has ended differently. Can you guess how?\"\n\n\n\nI laid down the letter for a moment. It cut me with such keen regret; it\nfired me with such hot rage--that I was within a hairsbreadth of tearing\nthe rest of it up unread, and trampling it under my feet. I took a turn\nin the room. I dipped my handkerchief in water, and bound it round my\nhead. In a minute or two I was myself again--I could force my mind away\nfrom my poor Lucilla, and return to the letter. It proceeded thus:\n\n\"I can write calmly of what I have next to tell you. You shall hear what\nI have decided, and what I have done.\n\n\"I told Nugent to wait in the room, while I went away, and thought over\nwhat he had said to me, by myself. He attempted to resist this. I\ninsisted on his yielding. For the first time in our lives, we changed\nplaces. It was I who took the lead, and he who followed. I left him and\nwent out into the valley alone.\n\n\"The heavenly tranquillity, the comforting solitude helped me. I saw my\nposition and his, in their true light. Before I got back, I had decided\n(cost me what it might) on myself making the sacrifice to which my\nbrother had offered to submit. For Lucilla's sake, and for Nugent's sake,\nI felt the certain assurance in my own mind that it was _my_ duty, and\nnot _his,_ to go.\n\n\"Don't blame me; don't grieve for me. Read the rest. I want you to think\nof this with my thoughts--to feel about it as I feel at this moment.\n\n\"Bearing in mind what Nugent has confessed, and what I have myself seen,\nhave I any right to hold Lucilla to her engagement? I am firmly persuaded\nthat I have no right. After inspiring her with terror and disgust at the\nmoment when her eyes first looked at me; after seeing her innocently\nhappy in Nugent's arms--how, in God's name, can I claim her as mine? Our\nmarriage has become an impossibility. For her own sake, I cannot, I dare\nnot, appeal to our engagement. The wreck of _my_ happiness is nothing.\nThe wreck of _her_ happiness would be a crime. I absolve her from her\nengagement. She is free.\n\n\"There is my duty towards Lucilla--as I see it.\n\n\"As to Nugent next. I owe it entirely to my brother (at the time of the\nTrial) that the honor of our family has been saved, and that I have\nescaped a shameful death on the scaffold. Is there any limit to the\nobligation that he has laid on me, after doing me such a service as this?\nThere is no limit. The man who loves Lucilla and the brother who has\nsaved my life are one. I am bound to leave him free--I do leave him\nfree--to win Lucilla by open and loyal means, if he can. As soon as Herr\nGrosse considers that she is fit to bear the disclosure, let her be told\nof the error into which she has fallen (through my fault)--let her read\nthese lines, purposely written to meet her eye as well as yours--and let\nmy brother tell her afterwards what has passed to-night in this house\nbetween himself and me. She loves him now, believing him to be Oscar.\nWill she love him still, after she has learnt to know him under his own\nname? The answer to that question rests with Time. If it is an answer in\nNugent's favor, I have already arranged to set aside from my income a\nsufficient yearly sum to place my brother in a position to begin his\nmarried life. I wish to leave his genius free to assert itself,\nuntrammeled by pecuniary cares. Possessing, as I do, far more than enough\nfor my own simple wants, I can dedicate my spare money to no better and\nnobler use than this.\n\n\"There is my duty towards Nugent--as I see it.\n\n\"What I have decided on you now know. What I have done can be told in two\nwords. I have left Browndown for ever. I have gone, to live or die (as\nGod pleases) under the blow that has fallen on me, far away from you all.\n\n\"Perhaps, when years have passed, and when their children are growing up\nround them, I may see Lucilla again, and may take as the hand of my\nsister, the hand of the beloved woman who might once have been my wife.\nThis may happen, if I live. If I die, you will none of you know it. My\ndeath shall not cast its shadow of sadness on their lives. Forgive me and\nforget me; and keep, as I keep, that first and noblest of all mortal\nhopes--the hope of the life to come.\n\n\"I enclose, when there is need for you to write to me, the address of my\nbankers in London. They will have their instructions. If you love me, if\nyou pity me, abstain from attempting to shake my resolution. You may\ndistress me--but you will never change me. Wait to write, until Nugent\nhas had the opportunity of pleading his own cause, and Lucilla has\ndecided on her future life.\n\n\"Once more, I thank you for the kindness which has borne with my\nweaknesses and my follies. God bless you--and goodbye.\n\n\"OSCAR.\"\n\n\n\nOf the effect which the first reading of this letter produced on me, I\nshall say nothing. Even at this distance of time, I shrink from reviving\nthe memory of what I suffered, alone in my room on that miserable night.\nLet it be enough if I tell you briefly at what decision I arrived.\n\nI determined on doing two things. First, on going to London by the\nearliest train the next morning, and finding my way to Oscar by means of\nhis bankers. Secondly, on preventing the villain who had accepted the\nsacrifice of his brother's happiness from entering the rectory in my\nabsence.\n\nThe one comfort I had, that night, was in feeling that, on these two\npoints, my mind was made up. There was a stimulant in my sense of my own\nresolution which strengthened me to make my excuses to Lucilla, without\nbetraying the grief that tortured me when I found myself in her presence\nagain. Before I went to my bed, I had left her quiet and happy; I had\narranged with Herr Grosse that he was still to keep his excitable patient\nsecluded from visitors all through the next day; and I had secured as an\nally to help me in preventing Nugent from entering the house, no less a\nperson than Reverend Finch himself. I saw him in his study overnight, and\ntold him all that had happened; keeping one circumstance only\nconcealed--namely, Oscar's insane determination to share his fortune with\nhis infamous brother. I purposely led the rector to suppose that Oscar\nhad left Lucilla free to receive the addresses of a man who had\ndissipated his fortune to the last farthing. Mr. Finch's harangue when\nthis prospect was brought within his range of contemplation, was\nsomething to be remembered, but not (on this occasion) to be reported--in\nmercy to the Church.\n\nBy the train of the next morning, I left for London.\n\nBy the train of the same evening, I returned alone to Dimchurch; having\ncompletely failed to achieve the purpose which taken me to the\nmetropolis.\n\nOscar had appeared at the bank as soon as the doors were opened in the\nmorning; had drawn out some hundreds of pounds in circular notes; had\ntold the bankers that they should be furnished with an address at which\nthey could write to him, in due course of time; and had departed for the\nContinent, without leaving a trace behind him.\n\nI spent the day in making what arrangements I could for discovering him\nby the usual methods of inquiry pursued in such cases; and took the\nreturn train to the country, with my mind alternating between despair\nwhen I thought of Lucilla, and anger when I thought of the twin-brothers.\nIn the first bitterness of my disappointment, I was quite as indignant\nwith Oscar as with Nugent. With all my heart I cursed the day which had\nbrought the one and the other to Dimchurch.\n\nAs we lengthened our distance from London, flying smoothly the tranquil\nwoods and fields, my mind, with time to help it, began to recover its\nbalance. Little by little, the unexpected revelation of firmness and\ndecision in Oscar's conduct--heartily as I still deplored and blamed that\nconduct--began to have a new effect on my mind. I now looked back in\namazement and self-reproach, at my own superficial estimate of the\ncharacters of the twin-brothers.\n\nThinking it over uninterruptedly, with no one in the carriage but myself,\nI arrived at a conclusion which strongly influenced my conduct in guiding\nLucilla through the troubles and perils that were still to come.\n\nOur physical constitutions have, as I take it, more to do with the\nactions which determine other people's opinions of us (as well as with\nthe course of our own lives) than we generally suppose. A man with\ndelicately-strung nerves says and does things which often lead us to\nthink more meanly of him than he deserves. It is his great misfortune\nconstantly to present himself at his worst. On the other hand, a man\nprovided with nerves vigorously constituted, is provided also with a\nconstitutional health and hardihood which express themselves brightly in\nhis manners, and which lead to a mistaken impression that his nature is\nwhat it appears to be on the surface. Having good health, he has good\nspirits. Having good spirits, he wins as an agreeable companion on the\npersons with whom he comes in contact--although he may be hiding all the\nwhile, under an outer covering which is physically wholesome, an inner\nnature which is morally diseased. In the last of these typical men, I saw\nreflected--Nugent. In the first--Oscar. All that was feeblest and poorest\nin Oscar's nature had shown itself on the surface in past times, to the\nconcealment of its stronger and its nobler side. There had been something\nhidden in this supersensitive man, who had shrunk under all the small\ntrials of his life in our village, which had proved firm enough, when the\ngreatness of the need called on it, to sustain the terrible disaster that\nhad fallen on him. The nearer I got to the end of my journey, the more\ncertain I felt that I was only now learning (bitterly as he had\ndisappointed me) to estimate Oscar's character at its true value.\nInspired by this conviction, I began already to face our hopeless\nprospects boldly. As long as I had life and strength to help her, I\ndetermined that Lucilla should _not_ lose the man, whose best qualities I\nhad failed to discover until he had made up his mind to turn his back on\nher for ever.\n\nWhen I reached the rectory, I was informed that Mr. Finch wished to speak\nto me. My anxiety about Lucilla made me unwilling to submit to any delay\nin seeing her. I sent a message, informing the rector that I would be\nwith him in a few minutes--and ran up-stairs into Lucilla's room.\n\n\"Has it been a very long day, my dear?\" I asked, when our first greetings\nwere over.\n\n\"It has been a delightful day,\" she answered joyously. \"Grosse took me\nout for a walk, before he went back to London. Can you guess where our\nwalk led us?\"\n\nA chilly sense of misgiving seized me. I drew back from her. I looked at\nher lovely face without the slightest admiration of it--worse still, with\ndownright distrust of it.\n\n\"Where did you go?\" I asked.\n\n\"To Browndown, of course!\"\n\nAn exclamation escaped me--(\"Infamous Grosse!\" spit out between my teeth\nin my own language). I could _not_ help it. I should have died if I had\nrepressed it--I was in such a rage.\n\nLucilla laughed. \"There! there! It was my fault; I insisted on speaking\nto Oscar. As soon as I had my own way, I behaved perfectly. I never asked\nto have the bandage taken off; I was satisfied with only speaking to him.\nDear old Grosse--he isn't half as hard on me as you and my father--was\nwith us, all the time. It has done me so much good. Don't be sulky about\nit, you darling Pratolungo! My 'surgeon optic' sanctions my imprudence. I\nwon't ask you to go with me to Browndown to-morrow; Oscar is coming to\nreturn my visit.\"\n\nThose last words decided me. I had had a weary time of it since the\nmorning; but (for me) the day was not at an end yet. I said to myself, \"I\nwill have it out with Mr. Nugent Dubourg, before I go to my bed\nto-night!\"\n\n\"Can you spare me for a little while?\" I asked. \"I must go to the other\nside of the house. Your father wishes to speak to me.\"\n\nLucilla started. \"About what?\" she inquired eagerly.\n\n\"About business in London,\" I answered--and left her, before her\ncuriosity could madden me (in the state I was in at that moment) with\nmore questions.\n\nI found the rector prepared to favor me with his usual flow of language.\nFifty Mr. Finches could not have possessed themselves of my attention in\nthe humour I was in at that moment. To the reverend gentleman's\namazement, it was I who began--and not he.\n\n\"I have just left Lucilla, Mr. Finch. I know what has happened.\"\n\n\"Wait a minute, Madame Pratolungo! One thing is of the utmost importance\nto begin with. Do you thoroughly understand that I am, in no sense of the\nword, to blame--?\"\n\n\"Thoroughly,\" I interposed. \"Of course, they would not have gone to\nBrowndown, if you had consented to let Nugent Dubourg into the house.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" said Mr. Finch, elevating his right hand. \"My good creature, you\nare in a state of hysterical precipitation. I will be heard! I did more\nthan refuse my consent. When the man Grosse--I insist on your composing\nyourself--when the man Grosse came and spoke to me about it, I did more,\nI say, infinitely more, than refuse my consent. You know my force of\nlanguage--don't be alarmed! I said, 'Sir! As pastor and parent, My Foot\nis down'----\"\n\n\"I understand, Mr. Finch. Whatever you said to Herr Grosse was quite\nuseless; he entirely ignored your personal point of view.\"\n\n\"Madame Pratolungo----!\"\n\n\"He found Lucilla dangerously agitated by her separation from Oscar: he\nasserted, what he calls, his professional freedom of action.\"\n\n\"Madame Pratolungo----!\"\n\n\"You persisted in closing your doors to Nugent Dubourg. _He_ persisted,\non his side--and took Lucilla to Browndown.\"\n\nMr. Finch got on his feet, and asserted himself at the full pitch of his\ntremendous voice.\n\n\"Silence!\" he shouted, with a smack of his open hand on the table at his\nside.\n\nI didn't care. _I_ shouted. _I_ came down, with a smack of my hand, on\nthe opposite side of the table.\n\n\"One question, sir, before I leave you,\" I said. \"Since your daughter\nwent to Browndown, you have had many hours at your disposal. Have you\nseen Mr. Nugent Dubourg?\"\n\nThe Pope of Dimchurch suddenly collapsed, in full fulmination of his\ndomestic Bulls.\n\n\"Pardon me,\" he replied, adopting his most elaborately polite manner.\n\"This requires considerable explanation.\"\n\nI declined to wait for considerable explanation. \"You have not seen him?\"\nI said.\n\n\"I have _not_ seen him,\" echoed Mr. Finch. \"My position towards Nugent\nDubourg is very remarkable, Madame Pratolungo. In my parental character,\nI should like to wring his neck. In my clerical character, I feel it\nincumbent on me to pause--and write to him. You feel the responsibility?\nYou understand the distinction?\"\n\nI understood that he was afraid. Answering him by an inclination of the\nhead (I hate a coward!) I walked silently to the door.\n\nMr. Finch returned my bow with a look of helpless perplexity. \"Are you\ngoing to leave me?\" he inquired blandly.\n\n\"I am going to Browndown.\"\n\nIf I had said that I was going to a place which the rector had frequent\noccasion to mention in the stronger passages of his sermons, Mr. Finch's\nface could hardly have shown more astonishment and alarm than it\nexhibited when I replied to him in those terms. He lifted his persuasive\nright hand; he opened his eloquent lips. Before the coming overflow of\nlanguage could reach me, I was out of the room, on my way to Browndown.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-EIGHTH\n\nIs there no Excuse for Him?\n\nOSCAR'S dismissed servant (left, during the usual month of warning, to\ntake care of the house) opened the door to me when I knocked. Although\nthe hour was already a late one in primitive Dimchurch, the man showed no\nsigns of surprise at seeing me.\n\n\"Is Mr. Nugent Dubourg at home?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\" He lowered his voice, and added, \"I think Mr. Nugent\nexpected to see you to-night.\"\n\nWhether he intended it, or not, the servant had done me a good turn--he\nhad put me on my guard. Nugent Dubourg understood my character better\nthan I had understood his. He had foreseen what would happen, when I\nheard of Lucilla's visit on my return to the rectory--and he had, no\ndoubt, prepared himself accordingly. I was conscious of a certain nervous\ntrembling (I own) as I followed the servant to the sitting-room. At the\nmoment, however, when he opened the door, this ignoble sensation left me\nas suddenly as it had come. I felt myself Pratolungo's widow again, when\nI entered the room.\n\nA reading-lamp, with its shade down, was the only light on the table.\nNugent Dubourg, comfortably reposing in an easychair, sat by the lamp,\nwith a cigar in his mouth, and a book in his hand. He put down the book\non the table as he rose to receive me. Knowing, by this time, what sort\nof man I had to deal with, I was determined not to let even the merest\ntrifles escape me. It might have its use in helping me to understand him,\nif I knew how he had been occupying his mind while he was expecting me to\narrive. I looked at the book. It was _Rousseau's Confessions._\n\nHe advanced with his pleasant smile, and offered his hand as if nothing\nhad happened to disturb our ordinary relations towards each other. I drew\nback a step, and looked at him.\n\n\"Won't you shake hands with me?\" he asked.\n\n\"I will answer that directly,\" I said. \"Where is your brother?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"When you _do_ know, Mr. Nugent Dubourg, and when you have brought your\nbrother back to this house, I will take your hand--not before.\"\n\nHe bowed resignedly, with a little satirical shrug of the shoulders, and\nasked if he might offer me a chair.\n\nI took a chair for myself, and placed it so that I might be opposite to\nhim when he resumed his seat. He checked himself in the act of sitting\ndown, and looked towards the open window.\n\n\"Shall I throw away my cigar?\" he said.\n\n\"Not on my account. I have no objection to smoking.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\" He took his chair--keeping his face in the partial obscurity\ncast by the shade of the lamp. After smoking for a moment, he spoke\nagain, without turning to look at me. \"May I ask what your object is in\nhonoring me with this visit?\"\n\n\"I have two objects. The first is to see that you leave Dimchurch\nto-morrow morning. The second is to make you restore your brother to his\npromised wife.\"\n\nHe looked round at me quickly. His experience of my irritable temper had\nnot prepared him for the perfect composure of voice and manner with which\nI answered his question. He looked back again from me to his cigar, and\nknocked off the ash at the tip of it (considering with himself) before he\naddressed his next words to me.\n\n\"We will come to the question of my leaving Dimchurch presently,\" he\nsaid. \"Have you received a letter from Oscar?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Have you read it?\"\n\n\"I have read it.\"\n\n\"Then you know that we understand each other?\"\n\n\"I know that your brother has sacrificed himself--and that you have taken\na base advantage of the sacrifice.\"\n\nHe started, and looked round at me once more. I saw that something in my\nlanguage, or in my tone of speaking, had stung him.\n\n\"You have your privilege as a lady,\" he said. \"Don't push it too far.\nWhat Oscar has done, he has done of his own free will.\"\n\n\"What Oscar has done,\" I rejoined, \"is lamentably foolish, cruelly wrong.\nStill, perverted as it is, there is something generous, something noble,\nin the motive which has led _him._ As for your conduct in this matter, I\nsee nothing but what is mean, nothing but what is cowardly, in the motive\nwhich has led _you._\"\n\nHe started to his feet, and flung his cigar into the empty fireplace.\n\n\"Madame Pratolungo,\" he said, \"I have not the honor of knowing anything\nof your family. I can't call a woman to account for insulting me. Do you\nhappen to have any _man_ related to you, in or out of England?\"\n\n\"I happen to have what will do equally well on this occasion,\" I replied.\n\"I have a hearty contempt for threats of all sorts, and a steady\nresolution in me to say what I think.\"\n\nHe walked to the door, and opened it.\n\n\"I decline to give you the opportunity of saying anything more,\" he\nrejoined. \"I beg to leave you in possession of the room, and to wish you\ngood evening.\"\n\nHe opened the door. I had entered the house, armed in my own mind with a\nlast desperate resolve, only to be communicated to him, or to anybody, in\nthe final emergency and at the eleventh hour. The time had come for\nsaying what I had hoped with my whole heart to have left unsaid.\n\nI rose on my side, and stopped him as he was leaving the room.\n\n\"Return to your chair and your book,\" I said. \"Our interview is at an\nend. In leaving the house, I have one last word to say. You are wasting\nyour time in remaining at Dimchurch.\"\n\n\"I am the best judge of that,\" he answered, making way for me to go out.\n\n\"Pardon me, you are not in a position to judge at all. You don't know\nwhat I mean to do as soon as I get back to the rectory.\"\n\nHe instantly changed his position; placing himself in the doorway so as\nto prevent me from leaving the room.\n\n\"What do you mean to do?\" he asked, keeping his eyes attentively fixed on\nmine.\n\n\"I mean to force you to leave Dimchurch.\"\n\nHe laughed insolently. I went on as quietly as before. \"You have\npersonated your brother to Lucilla this morning,\" I said. \"You have done\nthat, Mr. Nugent Dubourg, for the last time.\"\n\n\"Have I? Who will prevent me from doing it again?\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\nThis time he took it seriously.\n\n\"You?\" he said. \"How are _you_ to control me, if you please?\"\n\n\"I can control you through Lucilla. When I get back to the rectory, I\ncan, and will, tell Lucilla the truth.\"\n\nHe started--and instantly recovered himself.\n\n\"You forget something, Madame Pratolungo. You forget what the surgeon in\nattendance on her has told us.\"\n\n\"I remember it perfectly. If we say or do anything to agitate his\npatient, in her present state, the surgeon refuses to answer for the\nconsequences.\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"Well--between the alternative of leaving you free to break both their\nhearts, and the alternative of setting the surgeon's warning at\ndefiance--dreadful as the choice is, my choice is made. I tell you to\nyour face, I would rather see Lucilla blind again than see her your\nwife.\"\n\nHis estimate of the strength of the position on his side, had been\nnecessarily based on one conviction--the conviction that Grosse's\nprofessional authority would tie my tongue. I had scattered his\ncalculations to the winds. He turned so deadly pale that, dim as the\nlight was, I could see the change in his face.\n\n\"I don't believe you!\" he said.\n\n\"Present yourself at the rectory tomorrow,\" I answered--\"and you will\nsee. I have no more to say to you. Let me by.\"\n\nYou may suppose I was only trying to frighten him. I was doing nothing of\nthe sort. Blame me, or approve of me, as you please, I was expressing the\nresolution which I had in my mind when I spoke. Whether my courage would\nhave held out through the walk from Browndown to the rectory--whether I\nshould have shrunk from it when I actually found myself in Lucilla's\npresence--is more than I can venture to decide. All I say is that I did,\nin my desperation, positively mean doing it, at the moment when I\nthreatened to do it--and that Nugent Dubourg heard something in my voice\nwhich told him I was in earnest.\n\n\"You fiend!\" he burst out, stepping close up to me with a look of fury.\n\nThe whole passionate fervour of the love that the miserable wretch felt\nfor her, shook him from head to foot, as his horror of me found its way\nto expression in those two words.\n\n\"Spare me your opinion of my character,\" I said. \"I don't expect _you_\nto understand the motives of an honest woman. For the last time, let me\nby!\"\n\nInstead of letting me by, he locked the door, and put the key in his\npocket. That done, he pointed to the chair that I had left.\n\n\"Sit down,\" he said, with a sudden sinking in his voice which implied a\nsudden change in his temper. \"Let me have a minute to myself.\"\n\nI returned to my place. He took his own chair on the other side of the\ntable, and covered his face with his hands. We waited awhile in silence.\nI looked at him, once or twice, as the minutes followed each other. The\nshaded lamp-light glistened dimly on something between his fingers. I\nrose softly, and stretched across the table to look closer. Tears! On my\nword of honor, tears forcing their way through his fingers, as he held\nthem over his face! I had been on the point of speaking. I sat down again\nin silence.\n\n\"Say what you want of me. Tell me what you wish me to do.\" Those were his\nfirst words. He spoke them without moving his hands; so quietly, so\nsadly, with such hopeless sorrow, such uncomplaining resignation in his\nvoice, that I, who had entered that room, hating him, rose again, and\nwent round to his chair. I--who a minute ago, if I had had the strength,\nwould have struck him down on the floor at my feet--laid my hand on his\nshoulder, pitying him from the bottom of my heart. That is what women\nare! There is a specimen of their sense, firmness, and self-control!\n\n\"Be just, Nugent,\" I said. \"Be honorable. Be all that I once thought you.\nI want no more.\"\n\nHe dropped his arms on the table: his head fell on them, and he burst\ninto a fit of crying. It was so like his brother, that I could almost\nhave fancied I, too, had mistaken one of them for the other. \"Oscar over\nagain,\" I thought to myself, \"on the first day when I spoke to him in\nthis very room!\"\n\n\"Come!\" I said, when he was quieter. \"We shall end in understanding each\nother and respecting each other after all.\"\n\nHe irritably shook my hand off his shoulder, and turned his face away\nfrom the light.\n\n\"Don't talk of understanding _me,_\" he said. \"Your sympathy is for Oscar.\nHe is the victim; he is the martyr; he has all your consideration and all\nyour pity. I am a coward; I am a villain; I have no honor and no heart.\nTread Me under foot like a reptile. _My_ misery is only what I deserve!\nCompassion is thrown away--isn't it?--on such a scoundrel as I am?\"\n\nI was sorely puzzled how to answer him. All that he had said against\nhimself, I had thought of him in my own mind. And why not? He _had_\nbehaved infamously--he _was_ a fit object for righteous indignation. And\nyet--and yet--it is sometimes so very hard, however badly a man may have\nbehaved, for women to hold out against forgiving him, when they know that\na woman is at the bottom of it.\n\n\"Whatever I may have thought of you,\" I said, \"it is still in your power,\nNugent, to win back my old regard for you.\"\n\n\"Is it?\" he answered scornfully. \"I know better than that. You are not\ntalking to Oscar now--you are talking to a man who has had some\nexperience of women. I know how you all hold to your opinions because\nthey are your opinions--without asking yourselves whether they are right\nor wrong. There are men who could understand me and pity me. No woman can\ndo it. The best and cleverest among you don't know what love is--as a man\nfeels it. It isn't the frenzy with You that it is with Us. It\nacknowledges restraints in a woman--it bursts through everything in a\nman. It robs him of his intelligence, his honor, his self-respect--it\nlevels him with the brutes--it debases him into idiocy--it lashes him\ninto madness. I tell you I am not accountable for my own actions. The\nkindest thing you could do for me would be to shut me up in a madhouse.\nThe best thing I could do for myself would be to cut my throat.--Oh, yes!\nthis is a shocking way of talking, isn't it? I ought to struggle against\nit--as you say. I ought to summon my self-control. Ha! ha! ha! Here is a\nclever woman--here is an experienced woman. And yet--though she has seen\nme in Lucilla's company hundreds of times--she has never once discovered\nthe signs of a struggle in me! From the moment when I first saw that\nheavenly creature, it has been one long fight against myself, one\ninfernal torment of shame and remorse; and this clever friend of mine has\nobserved so little and knows so little, that she can only view my conduct\nin one light--it is the conduct of a coward and a villain!\"\n\nHe got up, and took a turn in the room. I was--naturally, I think--a\nlittle irritated by his way of putting it. A man assuming to know more\nabout love than a woman! Was there ever such a monstrous perversion of\nthe truth as that? I appeal to the women!\n\n\"You ought to be the last person to blame me,\" I said. \"I had too high an\nopinion of you to suspect what was going on. I will never make the same\nmistake again--I promise you that!\"\n\nHe came back, and stood still in front of me, looking me hard in the\nface.\n\n\"Do you really mean to say you saw nothing to set you thinking, on the\nday when I first met her?\" he asked. \"You were there in the room--didn't\nyou see that she struck me dumb? Did you notice nothing suspicious at a\nlater time? When I was suffering martyrdom, if I only looked at her--was\nthere nothing to be seen in me which told its own tale?\"\n\n\"I noticed that you were never at your ease with her,\" I replied. \"But I\nliked you and trusted you--and I failed to understand it. That's all.\"\n\n\"Did you fail to understand everything that followed? Didn't I speak to\nher father? Didn't I try to hasten Oscar's marriage?\"\n\nIt was true. He _had_ tried.\n\n\"When we first talked of his telling Lucilla of the discoloration of his\nface, did I not agree with you that he ought to put himself right with\nher, in his own interests?\"\n\nTrue again. Impossible to deny that he had sided with my view.\n\n\"When she all but found it out for herself, whose influence was used to\nmake him own it? Mine! What did I do, when he tried to confess it, and\nfailed to make her understand him? what did I do when she first committed\nthe mistake of believing _me_ to be the disfigured man?\"\n\nThe audacity of that last question fairly took away my breath. \"You\ncruelly helped to deceive her,\" I answered indignantly. \"You basely\nencouraged your brother in his fatal policy of silence.\"\n\nHe looked at me with an angry amazement on his side which more than\nequaled the angry amazement on mine.\n\n\"So much for the delicate perception of a woman!\" he exclaimed. \"So much\nfor the wonderful tact which is the peculiar gift of the sex! You can see\nno motive but a bad motive in my sacrificing myself for Oscar's sake?\"\n\nI began to discern faintly that there might have been another than a bad\nmotive for his conduct. But--well! I dare say I was wrong; I resented the\ntone he was taking with me; I would have owned I had made a mistake to\nanybody else in the world; I wouldn't own it to _him._ There!\n\n\"Look back for one moment,\" he resumed, in quieter and gentler tones.\n\"See how hardly you have judged me! I seized the opportunity--I swear to\nyou this is true--I seized the opportunity of making myself an object of\nhorror to her, the moment I heard of the mistake that she had made. I\nfelt in myself that I was growing less and less capable of avoiding her,\nand I caught at the chance of making _her_ avoid _me;_ I did that--and I\ndid more! I entreated Oscar to let me leave Dimchurch. He appealed to me,\nin the name of our love for each other, to remain. I couldn't resist him.\nWhere do you see signs of the conduct of a scoundrel in all this? Would a\nscoundrel have betrayed himself to you a dozen times over--as I did in\nthat talk of ours in the summer-house? I remember saying in so many\nwords, I wished I had never come to Dimchurch. What reason but one could\nthere be for my saying that? How is it that you never even asked me what\nI meant?\"\n\n\"You forget,\" I interposed, \"that I had no opportunity of asking you.\nLucilla interrupted us, and diverted my attention to other things. What\ndo you mean by putting me on my defence in this way?\" I went on, more and\nmore irritated by the tone he was taking with me. \"What right have you to\njudge my conduct?\"\n\nHe looked at me with a kind of vacant surprise.\n\n\"_Have_ I been judging your conduct?\" he asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I was thinking, if you had seen my infatuation in time you\nmight have checked it in time. No!\" he exclaimed, before I could answer\nhim. \"Nothing could have checked it--nothing will cure it but my death.\nLet us try to agree. I beg your pardon if I have offended you. I am\nwilling to take a just view of your conduct. Will you take a just view of\nmine?\"\n\nI tried hard to take a just view. Though I resented his manner of\nspeaking to me, I nevertheless secretly felt for him, as I have\nconfessed. Still I could not forget that he had attempted to attract to\nhimself Lucilla's first look, on the day when she tried her sight--that\nhe had personated his brother to Lucilla that very morning--that he had\nsuffered his brother to go away heart-broken, a voluntary exile from all\nthat he held dear. No! I could feel for him, but I could _not_ take a\njust view of him. I sat down, and said nothing.\n\nHe returned to the question between us; treating me with the needful\npoliteness, when he spoke next. For all that, he alarmed me, by what he\nnow said, as he had not alarmed me yet.\n\n\"I repeat what I have already told you,\" he proceeded. \"I am no longer\naccountable for what I do. If I know anything of myself, I believe it\nwill be useless to trust me in the future. While I am capable of speaking\nthe truth, let me tell it. Whatever happens at a later time--remember\nthis, I have honestly made a clean breast of it to-night.\"\n\n\"Stop!\" I cried. \"I don't understand your reckless way of talking. Every\nman is accountable for what he does.\"\n\nHe checked me there by an impatient wave of his hand.\n\n\"Keep your opinion; I don't dispute it. You will see; you will\nsee.--Madame Pratolungo, the day when we had that private talk of ours in\nthe rectory summer-house, marks a memorable date in my calendar. My last\nhonest struggle to be true to my poor Oscar ended with that day. The\nefforts I have made since then have been little better than mere\noutbreaks of despair. They have done nothing to help me against the\npassion that has become the one feeling and the one misery of my life.\nDon't talk of resistance. All resistance stops at a certain point. Since\nthe time I have told you of, _my_ resistance has reached its limits. You\nhave heard how I struggled against temptation, as long as I could resist\nit. I have only to tell you how I have yielded to it now.\"\n\nThe reckless, shameless composure with which he said that, began to set\nme against him once more. The perpetual shifts and contradictions in him,\nbewildered and irritated me. Quicksilver itself seemed to be less\nslippery to lay hold of than this man.\n\n\"Do you remember the day,\" he asked, \"when Lucilla lost her temper, and\nreceived you so rudely at your visit to Browndown?\"\n\nI made a sign in the affirmative.\n\n\"You spoke, a little while since, of my personating Oscar to her. I\npersonated him, on the occasion I have just mentioned, for the first\ntime. You were present and heard me. Did you care to speculate on the\nmotives which made me impose myself on her as my brother?\"\n\n\"As well as I can remember,\" I answered, \"I made the first guess that\noccurred to me. I thought you were indulging in a moment's mischievous\namusement at Lucilla's expense.\n\n\"I was indulging the passion that consumed me! I longed to feel the\nluxury of her touching me and being familiar with me, under the\nimpression that I was Oscar. Worse even than that, I wanted to try how\ncompletely I could impose on her--how easily I might marry her, if I\ncould only deceive you all, and take her away somewhere by herself. The\ndevil was in possession of me. I don't know how it might have ended, if\nOscar had not come in, and if Lucilla had not burst out as she did. She\ndistressed me--she frightened me--she gave me back again to my better\nself. I rushed, without stopping to prepare her, into the question of her\nrestoration to sight--as the only way of diverting her mind from the vile\nadvantage that I had taken of her blindness. That night, Madame\nPratolungo, I suffered pangs of self-reproach and remorse which would\neven have satisfied _you._ At the very next opportunity that offered, I\nmade my atonement to Oscar. I supported his interests; I even put the\nwords he was to say to Lucilla into his lips.\n\n\"When?\" I broke in. \"Where? How?\"\n\n\"When the two surgeons had left us. In Lucilla's sitting-room. In the\nheat of the discussion whether she should submit to the operation at\nonce--or whether she should marry Oscar first, and let Grosse try his\nexperiment on her eyes at a later time. If you recall our conversation,\nyou will remember that I did all I could to persuade Lucilla to marry my\nbrother before Grosse tried his experiment on her sight. Quite useless!\nYou threw all the weight of your influence into the opposite side of the\nscale. I failed. It made no difference. I had done what I had done in\nsheer despair: mere impulse--it didn't last. When the next temptation\ntried me, I behaved like a scoundrel--as you say.\"\n\n\"I have said nothing,\" I answered shortly.\n\n\"Very well--as you _think,_ then. Did you suspect me at last--when we met\nin the village, yesterday? Surely, even your eyes must have seen through\nme on that occasion!\"\n\nI answered silently, by an inclination of my head. I had no wish to drift\ninto another quarrel. Sorely as he was presuming on my endurance, I\ntried, in Lucilla's interests, to keep on friendly terms with him.\n\n\"You concealed it wonderfully well,\" he went on, \"when I tried to find\nout whether you had, or had not discovered me. You virtuous people are\nnot bad hands at deception, when it suits your interests to deceive. I\nneedn't tell you what my temptation was yesterday. The first look of her\neyes when they opened on the world; the first light of love and joy\nbreaking on her heavenly face--what madness to expect me to let that look\nfall on another man, that light show itself to other eyes! No living\nbeing, adoring her as I adored her, would have acted otherwise than I\ndid. I could have fallen down on my knees and worshipped Grosse, when he\ninnocently proposed to me to take the very place in the room which I was\ndetermined to occupy. You saw what I had in my mind! You did your\nbest--and did it admirably--to defeat me. Oh, you pattern people--you can\nbe as shifty with your resources, when a cunning trick is to be played,\nas the worst of us! You saw how it ended. Fortune stood my friend at the\neleventh hour; fortune can shine, like the sun, on the just and the\nunjust! _I_ had the first look of her eyes! _I_ felt the first light of\nlove and joy in her face falling on _me! I_ have had her arms round me,\nand her bosom on mine--\"\n\nI could endure it no longer.\n\n\"Open the door!\" I said. \"I am ashamed to be in the same room with you!\"\n\n\"I don't wonder at it,\" he answered. \"You may well be ashamed of me. I am\nashamed of myself.\"\n\nThere was nothing cynical in his tone, nothing insolent in his manner.\nThe same man who had just gloried in that abominable way, in his victory\nover innocence and misfortune, now spoke and looked like a man who was\nhonestly ashamed of himself. If I could only have felt convinced that he\nwas mocking me, or playing the hypocrite with me, I should have known\nwhat to do. But I say again--impossible as it seems--he was, beyond all\ndoubt, genuinely penitent for what he had said, the instant after he had\nsaid it! With all my experience of humanity, and all my practice in\ndealing with strange characters, I stopped mid-way between Nugent and the\nlocked door, thoroughly puzzled.\n\n\"Do you believe me?\" he asked.\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" I answered.\n\nHe took the key of the door out of his pocket, and put it on the\ntable--close to the chair from which I had just risen.\n\n\"I lose my head when I talk of her, or think of her,\" he went on. \"I\nwould give everything I possess not to have said what I said just now. No\nlanguage you can use is too strong to condemn it. The words burst out of\nme: if Lucilla herself had been present, I couldn't have controlled them.\nGo, if you like. I have no right to keep you here, after behaving as I\nhave done. There is the key, at your service. Only think first, before\nyou leave me. You had something to propose when you came in. You might\ninfluence me--you might shame me into behaving like an honorable man. Do\nas you please. It rests with you.\"\n\nWhich was I, a good Christian? or a contemptible fool? I went back once\nmore to my chair, and determined to give him a last chance.\n\n\"That's kind,\" he said. \"You encourage me; you show me that I am worth\ntrying again. I had a generous impulse in this room, yesterday. It might\nhave been something better than an impulse--if I had not had another\ntemptation set straight in my way.\"\n\n\"What temptation?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oscar's letter has told you: Oscar himself put the temptation in my way.\nYou must have seen it.\"\n\n\"I saw nothing of the sort.\"\n\n\"Doesn't he tell you that I offered to leave Dimchurch for ever? I meant\nit. I saw the misery in the poor fellow's face, when Grosse and I were\nleading Lucilla out of the room. With my whole heart, I meant it. If he\nhad taken my hand, and had said Good-bye, I should have gone. He wouldn't\ntake my hand. He insisted on thinking it over by himself. He came back,\nresolved to make the sacrifice, on his side----\"\n\n\"Why did you accept the sacrifice?\"\n\n\"Because he tempted me.\"\n\n\"Tempted you?\"\n\n\"Yes! What else can you call it--when he offered to leave me free to\nplead my own cause with Lucilla? What else can you call it--when he\nshowed me a future life, which was a life with Lucilla? Poor, dear,\ngenerous fellow, he tempted me to stay when he ought to have encouraged\nme to go. How could I resist him? Blame the passion that has got me body\nand soul: don't blame _me!_\"\n\nI looked at the book on the table--the book that he had been reading when\nI entered the room. These sophistical confidences of his were nothing but\nRousseau at second hand. Good! If he talked false Rousseau, nothing was\nleft for me but to talk genuine Pratolungo. I let myself go--I was just\nin the humour for it.\n\n\"How can a clever man like you impose on yourself in that way?\" I said.\n\"Your future with Lucilla? You have no future with Lucilla which is not\nshocking to think of. Suppose--you shall never do it, as long as I\nlive--suppose you married her? Good heavens, what a miserable life it\nwould be for both of you! You love your brother. Do you think you could\never really know a moment's peace, with one reflection perpetually\nforcing itself on your mind? 'I have cheated Oscar out of the woman whom\nhe loved; I have wasted his life; I have broken his heart.' You couldn't\nlook at her, you couldn't speak to her, you couldn't touch her, without\nfeeling it all embittered by that horrible reproach. And she? What sort\nof wife would she make you, when she knew how you had got her? I don't\nknow which of the two she would hate most--you or herself. Not a man\nwould pass her in the street, who would not rouse the thought in her--'I\nwonder whether _he_ has ever done anything as base as what my husband has\ndone.' Not a married woman of her acquaintance, but would make her sick\nat heart with envy and regret. 'Whatever faults he may have, your husband\nhasn't won you as my husband won me.' You happy? Your married life\nendurable? Come! I have saved a few pounds, since I have been with\nLucilla. I will lay you every farthing I possess, you two would be\nseparated by mutual consent before you had been six months man and wife.\n_Now,_ which will you do? Will you start for the Continent, or stay here?\nWill you bring Oscar back, like an honorable man? or let him go, and\ndisgrace yourself for ever?\"\n\nHis eyes sparkled; his color rose. He sprang to his feet, and unlocked\nthe door. What was he going to do? To start for the Continent, or to turn\nme out of the house?\n\nHe called to the servant.\n\n\"James!\"\n\n\"Yes, sir?\"\n\n\"Make the house fast when Madame Pratolungo and I have left it. I am not\ncoming back again.\"\n\n\"Sir!\"\n\n\"Pack my portmanteau, and send it after me to-morrow, to Nagle's Hotel,\nLondon.\"\n\nHe closed the door again, and came back to me.\n\n\"You refused to take my hand when you came in,\" he said. \"Will you take\nit now? I leave Browndown when you leave it; and I won't come back again\ntill I bring Oscar with me.\n\n\"Both hands!\" I exclaimed--and took him by both hands. I could say\nnothing more. I could only wonder whether I was waking or sleeping; fit\nto be put into an asylum, or fit to go at large?\n\n\"Come!\" he said. \"I will see you as far as the rectory gate.\n\n\"You can't go to-night,\" I answered. \"The last train has left hours\nsince.\"\n\n\"I can! I can walk to Brighton, and get a bed there, and leave for London\nto-morrow morning. Nothing will induce me to pass another night at\nBrowndown. Stop! One question before I put the lamp out.\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"Did you do anything towards tracing Oscar, when you were in London\nto-day?\"\n\n\"I went to a lawyer, and made what arrangements with him I could.\"\n\n\"Here is my pocket-book. Write me down his name and address.\"\n\nI wrote them. He extinguished the lamp, and led me into the passage. The\nservant was standing there bewildered. \"Good night, James. I am going to\nbring your master back to Browndown.\" With that explanation, he took up\nhis hat and stick, and gave me his arm. The moment after, we were out in\nthe dark valley, on our way to the village.\n\nOn the walk back to the rectory, he talked with a feverish volubility and\nexcitement. Avoiding the slightest reference to the subject discussed at\nour strange and stormy interview, he returned, with tenfold confidence in\nhimself, to his old boastful assertion of the great things he was going\nto do as a painter. The mission which called him to reconcile Humanity\nwith Nature; the superb scale on which he proposed to interpret\nsympathetic scenery for the benefit of suffering mankind; the prime\nnecessity of understanding him, not as a mere painter, but as Grand\nConsoler in Art--I had it all over again, by way of satisfying my mind as\nto his prospects and occupations in his future life. It was only when we\nstopped at the rectory-gate that he referred to what had passed between\nus--and even then, he only touched on the subject in the briefest\npossible way.\n\n\"Well?\" he said. \"Have I won back your old regard for me? Do you believe\nthere is a fine side to be found in the nature of Nugent Dubourg? Man is\na compound animal. You are a woman in ten thousand. Give me a kiss.\"\n\nHe kissed me, foreign fashion, on both cheeks.\n\n\"Now for Oscar!\" he shouted cheerfully. He waved his hat, and disappeared\nin the darkness. I stood at the gate till the last rapid pit-pat of his\nfeet died away in the silence of the night.\n\nAn indescribable depression seized on my spirits. I began to doubt him\nagain, the instant I was alone.\n\n\"Is there a time coming,\" I asked myself, \"when all that I have done\nto-night must be done over again?\"\n\nI opened the rectory-gate. Mr. Finch intercepted me before I could get\nround to our side of the house. He held up before me, in solemn triumph,\na manuscript of many pages.\n\n\"My Letter,\" he said. \"A Letter of Christian remonstrance, to Nugent\nDubourg.\"\n\n\"Nugent Dubourg has left Dimchurch.\"\n\nWith that reply, I told the rector in as few words as possible how my\nvisit to Browndown had ended.\n\nMr. Finch looked at his letter. All those pages of eloquence written for\nnothing? No! In the nature of things, _that_ could not possibly be. \"You\nhave done very well, Madame Pratolungo,\" he remarked, in his most\npatronizing manner. \"Very well indeed, all things considered. _But,_ I\ndon't think I shall act wisely if I destroy this.\" He carefully locked up\nhis manuscript, and turned to me again with a mysterious smile. \"I\nventure to think,\" said Mr. Finch with mock humility, \"My Letter will be\nwanted. Don't let me discourage you about Nugent Dubourg. Only let me\nsay:--Is he to be trusted?\"\n\nIt was said by a fool: it would never have been said at all, if he had\nnot written his wonderful letter. Still, it echoed, with a painful\nfidelity, the misgiving secretly present at that moment in my own\nmind--and, more yet, it echoed the misgiving in Nugent's mind, the doubt\nof himself which his own lips had confessed to me in so many words. I\nwished the rector good night, and went upstairs.\n\nLucilla was in bed and asleep, when I softly opened her door.\n\nAfter looking for awhile at her lovely peaceful face, I was obliged to\nturn away. It was time I left the bedside, when the sight of her only\nmade my spirits sink lower and lower. As I cast my last look at her\nbefore I closed the door, Mr. Finch's ominous question forced itself on\nme again. In spite of myself, I said to myself--\n\n\"Is he to be trusted?\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE THIRTY-NINTH\n\nShe Learns to See\n\nWITH the new morning, certain reflections found their way into my mind\nwhich were not of the most welcome sort. There was one serious element of\nembarrassment in my position towards Lucilla, which had not discovered\nitself to me when Nugent and I parted at the rectory gate.\n\nBrowndown was now empty. In the absence of both the brothers, what was I\nto say to Lucilla when the false Oscar failed to pay her his promised\nvisit that day?\n\nIn what a labyrinth of lies had the first fatal suppression of the truth\ninvolved us all! One deception after another had been forced on us; one\ndisaster after another had followed retributively as the result--and, now\nthat I was left to deal single-handed with the hard necessities of our\nposition, no choice seemed left to me but to go on deceiving Lucilla\nstill! I was weary of it and ashamed of it. At breakfast-time, I evaded\nall further discussion of the subject, after I had first ascertained that\nLucilla did not expect her visitor before the afternoon. For some time\nafter breakfast, I kept her at the piano. When she wearied of music, and\nbegan to talk of Oscar once more, I put on my hat, and set forth on a\ndomestic errand (of the kind usually entrusted to Zillah), solely for the\npurpose of keeping out of the way, and putting off to the last moment the\nhateful necessity of telling more lies. The weather stood my friend. It\nthreatened to rain; and Lucilla, on that account, refrained from\nproposing to accompany me.\n\nMy errand took me to a farm-house on the road which led to Brighton.\nAfter settling my business, I prolonged my walk, though the rain was\nalready beginning to fall. I had nothing on me that would spoil; and, in\nmy present frame of mind, a wet gown was a preferable alternative to\nreturning to the rectory.\n\nAfter I had walked about a mile further on, the solitude of the road was\nenlivened by the appearance of an open carriage approaching me from the\ndirection of Brighton. The hood was up to protect the person inside from\nthe rain. The person looked out as I passed, and stopped the carriage in\na voice which I instantly recognized as the voice of Grosse. Our gallant\noculist insisted (in the state of the weather) on my instantly taking\nshelter by his side and returning with him to the house.\n\n\"This is an unexpected pleasure,\" I said. \"I thought you had arranged not\nto see Lucilla again till the end of the week.\"\n\nGrosse's eyes glared at me through his spectacles with a dignity and\ngravity worthy of Mr. Finch himself.\n\n\"Shall I tell you something?\" he said. \"You see sitting at your side a\nlost surgeon-optic. I shall die soon. Put on my tombs, if you please, The\nmalady which killed this German mans was--Lofely Feench. When I am away\nfrom her--gif me your sympathies: I so much want it--I sweat with\nanxiousness for young Miss. Your damn-mess-fix about those two brodders\nis a sort of perpetual blisters on my mind. Instead of snoring peaceably\nall night in my nice big English beds, I roll wide awake on my pillows,\nfidgeting for Feench. I am here to-day before my time. For what? For to\ntry her eyes--you think? Goot Madam, you think wrong! It is not her eyes\nwhich troubles me. Her eyes will do. It is You--and the odders at your\nrectory-place. You make me nervous-anxious about my patients. I am afraid\nsome of you will let the mess-fix of those brodder-twins find its way to\nher pretty ears, and turn her poor little mind topsy-turvies when I am\nnot near to see to it in time. Will you let her be comfortable-easy for\ntwo months more? Ach Gott! if I could only be certain-sure of _that,_ I\nmight leave those weak new eyes of hers to cure themselves, and go my\nways back to London again.\"\n\nI had intended to remonstrate with him pretty sharply for taking Lucilla\nto Browndown. After what he had now said, it was useless to attempt\nanything of that sort--and doubly useless to hope that he would let me\nextricate myself from my difficulties by letting me tell her the truth.\n\n\"Of course you are the best judge,\" I said. \"But you little know what\nthese precautions of yours cost the unfortunate people who are left to\ncarry them out.\"\n\nHe took me up sharply at those words.\n\n\"You shall judge for yourself,\" he said, \"if it is not worth the cost. If\nher eyes satisfy me--Feench shall learn to see to-day. You shall stand\nby, you obstinate womans, and judge if it is goot to add shock and\nagitation to the exhaustions and irritabilities and bedevilments of all\nsorts which our poor Miss must suffer in learning to see, after being\nblind for all her life. No more of it now, till we get to the\nrectory-place.\" By way of changing the subject for the present, he put a\nquestion to me which I felt it necessary to answer with some caution.\n\"How is my nice boys?--my bright-clever Nugent?\" he asked.\n\n\"Very well.\"\n\nThere I stopped, not feeling at all sure of the ground I was treading on.\n\n\"Mind this!\" Grosse went on. \"My bright-boy-Nugent keeps her\ncomfortable-easy. My bright-boy-Nugent is worth all the rest of you\ntogedder. I insist on his making his visits to young Miss at the\nrectory-place, in spite of that windy-talky-puff-bag-Feench-father of\nhers. I say positively--Nugent shall come into the house.\"\n\nThere was no help for it now. I was obliged to tell him that Nugent had\nleft Browndown, and that I was the person who had sent him away.\n\nFor a moment, I was really in doubt whether the skilled hand of the great\nsurgeon would not be ignobly employed in boxing my ears. No perversion of\nspelling can possibly report the complicated German-English jargon in\nwhich his fury poured itself out on my devoted head. Let it be enough to\nsay that he declared Nugent's abominable personation of his brother to be\nvitally important--so long as Oscar was absent--to his successful\ntreatment of the sensitive and excitable patient whom we had placed under\nhis care. I vainly assured him that Nugent's object in leaving Dimchurch\nwas to set matters right again by bringing his brother back. Grosse\nflatly declined to allow himself to be influenced by any speculative\nconsideration of that sort. He said (and swore) that my meddling had\nraised a serious obstacle in his way, and that nothing but his own tender\nregard for Lucilla prevented him from \"turning the coachmans back,\" and\nleaving us henceforth to shift for ourselves.\n\nWhen we reached the rectory gate, he had cooled a little. As we crossed\nthe garden, he reminded me that I stood pledged to be present when the\nbandage was taken off.\n\n\"Now mind!\" he said. \"You are going to see, if it is goot or bad to tell\nher that she has had those nice white arms of hers round the wrong\nbrodder. You are going to tell me afterwards, if you dare say to her, in\nplain English words, 'Blue-Face is the man.'\"\n\nWe found Lucilla in the sitting-room. Grosse briefly informed her that he\nhad nothing particular to occupy him in London, and that he had advanced\nthe date of his visit on that account. \"You want something to do, my\nlofe, on this soaky-rainy day. Show Papa-Grosse what you can do with your\neyes, now you have got them back again.\" With those words, he unfastened\nthe bandage, and, taking her by the chin, examined her eyes--first\nwithout his magnifying glass; then with it.\n\n\"Am I going on well?\" she asked anxiously.\n\n\"Famous-well! You go on (as my goot friends say in America) first-class.\nNow use your eyes for yourself. Gif one lofing look to Grosse first.\nThen--see! see! see!\"\n\nThere was no mistaking the tone in which he spoke to her.\n\nHe was not only satisfied about her eyes--he was triumphant. \"Soh!\" he\ngrunted, turning to me. \"Why is Mr. Sebrights not here to look at this?\"\n\nI eagerly approached Lucilla. There was still a little dimness left in\nher eyes. I noticed also that they moved to and fro restlessly, and (at\ntimes) wildly. But, oh, the bright change in her! the new life of beauty\nwhich the new sense had bestowed on her already! Her smile, always\ncharming, now caught light from her lips, and spread its gentle\nfascination over all her face. It was impossible not to long to kiss her.\nI advanced to congratulate, to embrace her. Grosse stepped forward, and\nchecked me.\n\n\"No,\" he said. \"Walk your ways to the odder end of the rooms--and let us\nsee if _she_ can go to _you._\"\n\nLike all other people, knowing no more of the subject than I knew, I had\nno idea of the pitiably helpless manner in which the restored sense of\nsight struggles to assert itself, in persons who have been blind for\nlife. In such cases, the effort of the eyes that are first learning to\nsee, is like the effort of the limbs when a child is first learning to\nwalk. But for Grosse's odd way of taking it, the scene which I was now to\nwitness would have been painful in the last degree. My poor\nLucilla--instead of filling me with joy, as I had anticipated--would I\nreally believe have wrung my heart, and have made me burst out crying.\n\n\"Now!\" said Grosse, laying one hand on Lucilla's arm, while he pointed to\nme with the other. \"There she stands. Can you go to her?\"\n\n\"Of course I can!\"\n\n\"I lay you a bet-wager you can _not!_ Ten thausand pounds to six pennies.\nDone-done. Now try!\"\n\nShe answered by a little gesture of defiance, and took three hasty steps\nforward. Bewildered and frightened, she stopped suddenly at the third\nstep--before she had advanced half the way from her end of the room to\nmine.\n\n\"I saw her here,\" she said, pointing down to the spot on which she was\nstanding; and appealing piteously to Grosse. \"I see her now--and I don't\nknow where she is! She is so near, I feel as if she touched my eyes--and\nyet\" (she advanced another step, and clutched with her hands at the empty\nair)--\"and yet, I can't get near enough to take hold of her. Oh! what\ndoes it mean? what does it mean?\"\n\n\"It means--pay me my six pennies!\" said Grosse. \"The wager-bet is mine!\"\n\nShe resented his laughing at her, with an obstinate shake of her head,\nand an angry knitting of her pretty eyebrows.\n\n\"Wait a little,\" she said. \"You shan't win quite so easily as that. I\nwill get to her yet!\"\n\nShe came straight to me in a moment--just as easily as I could have gone\nto her myself if I had tried.\n\n\"Another wager-bet!\" cried Grosse, still standing behind her, and\ncalling to me. \"Twenty thousand pounds this time to a fourpennies-bit.\n_She has shut her eyes to get to you._ Hey!\"\n\nIt was true--she had blindfolded herself! With her eyes closed, she\ncould measure to a hair's breadth the distance which, with her eyes\nopened, she was perfectly incompetent to calculate! Detected by both of\nus, she sat down, poor dear, with a sigh of despair. \"Was it worth\nwhile,\" she said to me sadly, \"to go through the operation for _this?_\"\n\nGrosse joined us at our end of the room.\n\n\"All in goot time,\" he said. \"Patience--and these helpless eyes of yours\nwill learn. Soh! I shall begin to teach them now. You have got your own\nnotions--hey?--about this colors and that? When you were blind, did you\nthink what would be your favorite colors if you could see? You did? Which\ncolors is it? Tell me. Come!\"\n\n\"White first,\" she answered. \"Then scarlet.\"\n\nGrosse paused, and considered.\n\n\"White, I understand,\" he said. \"White is the fancy of a young girls. But\nwhy scarlets? Could you see scarlets when you were blind?\"\n\n\"Almost,\" she answered, \"if it was bright enough. I used to feel\nsomething pass before my eyes when scarlet was shown to me.\"\n\n\"In these cataracts-cases, it is constantly scarlets that they almost\nsee,\" muttered Grosse to himself. \"There must be reason for this--and I\nmust find him.\" He went on with his questions to Lucilla. \"And the colors\nyou hate most--which is _he?_\"\n\n\"Black.\"\n\nGrosse nodded his head approvingly. \"I thought so,\" he said. \"It is\nalways black that they hate. For this also there must be reason--and I\nmust find _him._\"\n\nHaving expressed that resolution, he approached the writing-table, and\ntook a sheet of paper out of the case, and a circular pen-wiper of\nscarlet cloth out of the inkstand. After that, he looked about him;\nwaddled back to the other end of the room; and fetched the black felt hat\nin which he had traveled from London. He ranged the hat, the paper, and\nthe pen-wiper in a row. Before he could put his next question to her, she\npointed to the hat with a gesture of disapproval.\n\n\"Take it away,\" she said. \"I don't like that.\"\n\nGrosse stopped me before I could speak.\n\n\"Wait a little,\" he whispered in my ear. \"It is not quite so wonderful as\nyou think. These blind peoples, when they first see, have all alike the\nsame hatred of anything what is dark.\" He turned to Lucilla. \"Say,\" he\nasked. \"Is your favorite colors among these things here?\"\n\nShe passed by the hat in contempt; looked at the pen-wiper, and put it\ndown; looked at the sheet of paper, and put it down; hesitated--and again\nshut her eyes.\n\n\"No!\" cried Grosse. \"I won't have it! How dare you blind yourself, in the\npresence of Me? What! I give you back your sights, and you go shut your\neyes. Open them--or I will put you in the corner like a naughty girls.\nYour favorite colors? Now, now, now!\"\n\nShe opened her eyes (very unwillingly), and looked once more at the\npen-wiper and the paper.\n\n\"I see nothing as bright as my favorite colors here,\" she said.\n\nGrosse held up the sheet of paper, and pressed the question without\nmercy.\n\n\"What! is white, whiter than this?\"\n\n\"Fifty thousand times whiter than that!\"\n\n\"Goot. Now mind! This paper is white,\" (he snatched her handkerchief out\nof her apron-pocket). \"This handkerchief is white, too; whitest of white,\nboth of them. First lesson, my lofe! Here in my hands is your favorite\ncolors, in the time when you were blind.\"\n\n\"_Those!_\" she exclaimed, pointing to the paper and the handkerchief,\nwith a look of blank disappointment as he dropped them on the table. She\nturned over the pen-wiper and the hat, and looked round at me. Grosse,\nwaiting to try another experiment, left it to me to answer. The result,\nin both cases, was the same as in the cases of the sheet of paper and the\nhandkerchief. Scarlet was not half as red--black, not one-hundredth part\nas black--as her imagination had figured them to her, in the days when\nshe was blind. Still, as to this last color--as to black--she could feel\nsome little encouragement. It had affected her disagreeably (just as poor\nOscar's face had affected her), though she had not actually known it for\nthe color that she disliked. She made an effort, poor child, to assert\nherself, against her merciless surgeon-teacher. \"I didn't know it was\nblack,\" she said. \"But I hated the sight of it, for all that.\"\n\nShe tried, as she spoke, to toss the hat on to a chair, standing close\nby her--and threw it instead, high above the back of the chair, against\nthe wall, at least six feet away from the object at which she had aimed.\n\"I am a helpless fool!\" she burst out; her face flushing crimson with\nmortification. \"Don't let Oscar see me! I can't bear the thought of\nmaking myself ridiculous before _him!_ He is coming here,\" she added,\nturning to me entreatingly. \"Manage to make some excuse for his not\nseeing me till later in the day.\"\n\nI promised to find the excuse--all the more readily, that I now saw an\nunexpected chance of reconciling her in some degree (so long as she was\nlearning to see) to the blank produced in her life by Oscar's absence.\n\nShe addressed herself again to Grosse.\n\n\"Go on!\" she said impatiently. \"Teach me to be something better than an\nidiot--or put the bandage on, and blind me again. My eyes are of no use\nto me! Do you hear?\" she cried furiously, taking him by his broad\nshoulders and shaking him with all her might--\"my eyes are of no use to\nme!\"\n\n\"Now! now! now!\" cried Grosse. \"If you don't keep your tempers, you\nlittle spitfire, I will teach you nothing.\" He took up the sheet of paper\nand the pen-wiper; and, forcing her to sit down, placed them together\nbefore her, in her lap.\n\n\"Do you know one thing?\" he went on. \"Do you know what is meant by an\nobjects which is square? Do you know what is meant by an objects which is\nround?\"\n\nInstead of answering him, she appealed indignantly to my opinion.\n\n\"Is it not monstrous,\" she asked, \"to hear him put such a question to me\nas that? Do I know round from square? Oh, how cruelly humiliating! Don't\ntell Oscar! don't tell Oscar!\"\n\n\"If you know,\" persisted Grosse, \"you can tell me. Look at those two\nthings in your lap. Are they both round? or both square? or is one round?\nand the odder square? Look now, and tell me.\"\n\nShe looked--and said nothing.\n\n\"Well?\" continued Grosse.\n\n\"You put me out, standing there staring at me through your horrid\nspectacles!\" she said irritably. \"Don't look at me, and I will tell you\ndirectly.\"\n\nGrosse turned his head my way, with his diabolical grin; and signed to me\nto keep watch on her, in his place.\n\nThe instant his back was turned, she shut her eyes, and ran over the\npaper and the pen-wiper with the tips of her fingers!\n\n\"One is round and one is square,\" she answered, cunningly opening her\neyes again, just in time to bear critical inspection when Grosse turned\nround towards her once more.\n\nHe took the paper and the pen-wiper out of her hands; and (thoroughly\nunderstanding the trick she had played him) changed them for a bronze\nsaucer and a book. \"Which is round? and which is square of these?\" he\nasked, holding them up before her.\n\nShe looked first at one, and then at the other--plainly incapable (with\nonly her eyes to help her) of answering the question.\n\n\"I put you out--don't I?\" said Grosse. \"You can't shut your eyes, my\nlofely Feench, while I am looking--can you?\"\n\nShe turned red--then pale again. I began to be afraid she would burst out\ncrying. Grosse managed her to perfection. The tact of this rough, ugly,\neccentric old man was the most perfect tact I have ever met with.\n\n\"Shut your eyes,\" he said soothingly. \"It is the right ways to learn.\nShut your eyes, and take them in your hands, and tell me which is round\nand which is square in that way first.\"\n\nShe told him directly.\n\n\"Goot! now open your eyes, and see for yourself it is the saucers you\nhave got in your right hand, and the books you have got in your left. You\nsee? Goot again! Put them back on the table now. What shall we do next?\"\n\n\"May I try if I can write?\" she asked eagerly. \"I do so want to see if I\ncan write with my eyes instead of my finger.\"\n\n\"No! Ten thausand times no! I forbid reading; I forbid writing, yet. Come\nwith me to the window. How do these most troublesome eyes of yours do at\na distance?\"\n\nWhile we had been trying our experiment with Lucilla, the weather had\nbrightened again. The clouds were parting; the sun was coming out; the\nbright gaps of blue in the sky were widening every moment; the shadows\nwere traveling grandly over the windy slopes of the hills. Lucilla lifted\nher hands in speechless admiration as the German threw open the window,\nand placed her face to face with the view.\n\n\"Oh!\" she exclaimed, \"don't speak to me! don't touch me!--let me enjoy\nit! There is no disappointment _here._ I have never thought, I have never\ndreamed, of anything half so beautiful as _this!_\"\n\nGrosse looked at me, and silently pointed to her. She had turned\npale--she was trembling in every limb, overwhelmed by her own ecstatic\nsense of the glory of the sky and the beauty of the earth, as they now\nmet her view for the first time. I penetrated the surgeon's object in\ndirecting my attention to her. \"See\" (he meant to say), \"what a\ndelicately-organized creature we have to deal with! Is it possible to be\ntoo careful in handling such a sensitive temperament as that?\"\nUnderstanding him only too well, I also trembled when I thought of the\nfuture. Everything now depended on Nugent. And Nugent's own lips had told\nme that he could not depend on himself!\n\nIt was a relief to me when Grosse interrupted her.\n\nShe pleaded hard to be allowed to stay at the window a little longer. He\nrefused to allow it. Upon that she flew instantly into the opposite\nextreme. \"I am in my own room, and I am my own mistress,\" she said\nangrily. \"I insist on having my own way.\" Grosse was ready with his\nanswer.\n\n\"Take your own ways; fatigue those weak new eyes of yours--and to-morrow,\nwhen you try to look out of window, you will not be able to see at all.\"\nThis reply terrified her into instant submission. She assisted in\nreplacing the bandage with her own hands. \"May I go away to my own room?\"\nshe asked, with the simplicity of a child. \"I have seen such beautiful\nsights--and I do so want to think of them by myself.\"\n\nThe medical adviser instantly granted the patient's request. Any\nproceeding which tended to compose her, was a proceeding of which he\nhighly approved.\n\n\"If Oscar comes,\" she whispered, as she passed me on her way to the door,\n\"mind I hear of it! and mind you don't tell him of the mistakes I have\nmade!\" She paused for a moment, thinking. \"I don't understand myself,\"\nshe said. \"I never was so happy in my life. And yet I feel almost ready\nto cry!\" She turned towards Grosse. \"Come here, papa. You have been very\ngood to me to-day. I will give you a kiss.\" She laid her hands lightly on\nhis shoulders; kissed his lined and wrinkled cheek; gave me a little\nsqueeze round the waist--and left us. Grosse turned sharply to the\nwindow, and used his huge silk handkerchief for a purpose to which (I\nsuspect) it had not been put for many a long year past.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FORTIETH\n\nTraces of Nugent\n\n\"MADAME PRATOLUNGO!\"\n\n\"Herr Grosse?\"\n\nHe put his handkerchief back into his pocket, and turned round to me from\nthe window with his face composed again, and his tea-caddy snuff-box in\nhis hand.\n\n\"Now you have seen for your own self,\" he said, with an emphatic rap on\nthe box, \"do you dare tell that sweet girls which of them it is that has\ngone his ways and left her for ever?\"\n\nIt is not easy to find a limit to the obstinacy of women--when men expect\nthem to acknowledge themselves to have been wrong. After what I had seen,\nI no more dared tell her than he did. I was only too obstinate to\nacknowledge it to him--just yet.\n\n\"Mind this!\" he went on. \"Whether you shake her with frights, or whether\nyou heat her with rages, or whether you wound her with griefs--it all\ngoes straight the same to those weak new eyes of hers. They are so weak\nand so new, that I must ask once more for my beds here to-night, for to\nsee to-morrow if I have not already tried them too much. Now, for the\nlast time of asking, have you got the abominable courage in you to tell\nher the truth?\"\n\nHe had found my limit at last. I was obliged to own (heartily as I\ndisliked doing it) that there was, for the present, no choice left but\nmercifully to conceal the truth. Having gone this length I next attempted\nto consult him as to the safest manner in which I could account to\nLucilla for Oscar's absence. He refused (as a man) to recognize the\nslightest necessity for giving me (as a woman) any advice on a question\nof evasions and excuses. \"I have not lived all my years in the world,\nwithout learning something,\" he said. \"When it comes to walking upon\neggshells and telling fips, the womens have nothing to learn from the\nmens.--Will you take a little stroll-walk with me in the garden? I have\none odder thing to say to you: and I am hungry and thirsty both\ntogedder--for This.\"\n\nHe produced \"This,\" in the form of his pipe. We left the room at once for\nour stroll in the garden.\n\nHaving solaced himself with his first mouthful of tobacco-smoke, he\nstartled me by announcing that he meant to remove Lucilla forthwith from\nDimchurch to the sea-side. In doing this, he was actuated by two\nmotives--first, the medical motive of strengthening her constitution:\nsecond, the personal motive of preserving her from making painful\ndiscoveries by placing her out of reach of the gossip of the rectory and\nthe village. Grosse had the lowest opinion of Mr. Finch and his\nhousehold. His dislike and distrust of the rector, in particular, knew no\nbounds: he characterized the Pope of Dimchurch as an Ape with a long\ntongue, and a man-and-monkey capacity for doing mischief. Ramsgate was\nthe watering-place which he had fixed on. It was at a safe distance from\nDimchurch; and it was near enough to London to enable him to visit\nLucilla frequently. The one thing needed was my co-operation in the new\nplan. If I was at liberty to take charge of Lucilla, he would speak to\nthe Ape with the long tongue; and we might start for Ramsgate before the\nend of the week.\n\nWas there anything to prevent me from carrying out the arrangement\nproposed?\n\nThere was nothing to prevent me. My one other anxiety apart from\nLucilla--anxiety about good Papa--had now, for some time, been happily\nset at rest. Letter after letter from my sisters in France, brought me\nalways the same cheering news. My evergreen parent had at last discovered\nthat he was no longer in the first bloom of his youth. He had resigned to\nhis juniors, with pathetic expressions of regret, the making of love and\nthe fighting of duels. Ravaged by past passions, this dear innocent had\nnow found a refuge from swords, pistols, and the sex, in collecting\nbutterflies and playing on the guitar. I was free wholly to devote myself\nto Lucilla; and I honestly rejoiced in the prospect before me. Alone with\nher, and away from the rectory (where there was always danger off gossip\nreaching her ears) I could rely on myself to protect her from harm in the\npresent, and to preserve her for Oscar in the future. With all my heart I\nagreed to the arrangements as Grosse proposed them. When we parted in the\ngarden, he went round to the rector's side of the house to announce (in\nhis medical capacity) the decision at which he had arrived--while I, on\nmy side, went back to Lucilla to make the best excuses that I could\ninvent for Oscar, and to prepare her for our speedy removal from\nDimchurch.\n\n\n\n\"Gone, without coming to say good-bye! Gone, without even writing to me!\"\n\nThere was the first impression I produced on her, when I had done my best\nto account harmlessly for Oscar's absence. I had, as I thought, taken the\nshortest and simplest way out of the difficulty, by merely inverting the\ntruth. In other words, by telling her that Nugent had got into some\nserious embarrassment abroad, and that Oscar had been called away at a\nmoment's notice, to follow him and help him. It was in vain that I\nreminded her of Oscar's well-known horror of leave-takings of all kinds;\nin vain that I represented the urgency of the matter as leaving him no\nalternative but to confide his excuses and his farewells to me; in vain\nthat I promised for him that he would write to her at the first\nopportunity. She listened, without conviction. The more perseveringly I\ntried to account for it, the more perseveringly she dwelt on Oscar's\nunaccountable disregard of her claims on his consideration for her. As\nfor our journey to Ramsgate, it was impossible to interest her in the\nsubject. I gave it up in despair.\n\n\"Surely Oscar has left some address at which I can write to him?\" she\nsaid.\n\nI could only answer that he was not sure enough of his movements to be\nable to do that before he went away.\n\n\"It is more provoking than you think,\" she went on. \"I believe Oscar is\nafraid to bring his unfortunate brother into my presence. The blue face\nstartled me when I saw it, I know. But I have quite got over that. I feel\nnone of the absurd terror of the poor man which I felt when I was blind.\nNow that I have seen for myself what he is really like, I can feel for\nhim. I wanted to tell Oscar this--I wanted to say that he might bring his\nbrother to live with us if he liked--I wanted to prevent (just what has\nhappened,) his going away from _me_ when he wishes to see his brother.\nYou are using me very hardly among you; and I have some reason to\ncomplain of it.\"\n\nWhile she was talking in this mortifying manner, I felt some consolation\nnevertheless. Oscar's disfigured complexion would not be the terrible\nobstacle in the way of his restoration to Lucilla that I had feared. All\nthe comfort which this reflection could give, I wanted badly enough.\nThere was no open hostility towards me on Lucilla's part--but there was a\ncoolness which I found more distressing to bear than hostility itself. I\nbreakfasted in bed the next morning, and only rose towards noon--just in\ntime to say good-bye to Grosse before he returned to London.\n\nHe was in high good spirits about his patient. Her eyes were the better\ninstead of the worse for the exertion to which he had subjected them on\nthe previous day. The bracing air of Ramsgate was all that was wanting to\ncomplete the success of the operation. Mr. Finch had started objections,\nall turning on the question of expense. But with a daughter who was her\nown mistress, and who had her own fortune, his objections mattered\nnothing. By the next day, or the day after at latest, we were to start\nfor Ramsgate. I promised to write to our good surgeon as soon as we were\nestablished; and he engaged on his side, to visit us immediately after.\n\"Let her use her eyes for two goot hours every day,\" said Grosse, at\nparting. \"She may do what she likes with them--except that she must not\npeep into books, or take up pens, till I come to you at Ramsgate. It is\nmost wonderful-beautiful to see how those new eyes of hers do get along.\nWhen I next meet goot Mr. Sebrights--hey! how I shall cock-crow over that\nspick-span respectable man!\"\n\nI felt a little nervous as to how the day would pass--when the German\nleft me alone with Lucilla.\n\nTo my amazement, she not only met me with the needful excuses for her\nbehavior on the previous day, but showed herself to be perfectly resigned\nto the temporary loss of Oscar's society. It was she (not I) who remarked\nthat he could not have chosen a better time for being away from her, than\nthe humiliating time when she was learning to distinguish between round\nand square. It was she (not I) who welcomed the little journey to\nRamsgate as a pleasant change in her dull life, which would help to\nreconcile her to Oscar's absence. In brief, if she had actually received\na letter from Oscar, relieving her of all anxiety about him, her words\nand looks could hardly have offered a completer contrast than they now\nshowed to her words and looks of the previous day.\n\n\nIf I had noticed no other alteration in her than this welcome change for\nthe better, my record of the day would have ended here, as the record of\nunmixed happiness.\n\nBut, I grieve to say, I have something unpleasant to add. While she was\nmaking her excuses to me, and speaking in the sensible and satisfactory\nterms which I have just repeated, I noticed a curious underlying\nembarrassment in her manner, entirely unlike any previous embarrassment\nwhich had ever intruded itself between us. And, stranger still, on the\nfirst occasion when Zillah came into the room, while I was in it, I\nobserved that Lucilla's embarrassment was reflected (when the old woman\nspoke to me) in the face and manner of Lucilla's nurse.\n\nBut one conclusion could possibly follow from what I saw:--they were both\nconcealing something from me; and they were both more or less ashamed of\nwhat they were doing.\n\nSomewhere--not very far back in these pages--I have said of myself that I\nam not by nature a woman who is easily ready to suspect others. On this\nvery account, when I find suspicion absolutely forced on me--as it was\nnow--I am apt to fly into the opposite extreme. In the present case, I\nfixed on the person to suspect--all the more readily from having been\nslow to suspect him in bygone days. \"In some way or other,\" I said to\nmyself, \"Nugent Dubourg is at the bottom of this.\"\n\nWas he communicating with her privately, in the name and in the character\nof Oscar?\n\nThe bare idea of it hurried me headlong into letting her know that I had\nnoticed the change in her.\n\n\"Lucilla!\" I said. \"Has anything happened?\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" she asked coldly.\n\n\"I fancy I see some change----\" I began.\n\n\"I don't understand you,\" she answered, walking away from me as she\nspoke.\n\nI said no more. If our intimacy had been less close and less\naffectionate, I might have openly avowed to her what was passing in my\nmind. But how could I say to Lucilla, You are deceiving me? It would have\nbeen the end of our sisterhood--the end of our friendship. When\nconfidence is withdrawn between two people who love each\nother--everything is withdrawn. They are on the footing of strangers from\nthat moment, and must stand on ceremony. Delicate minds will understand\nwhy I accepted the check she had administered to me, and said no more.\n\nI went into the village alone. Managing matters so as to excite no\nsurprise, I contrived to have a little gossip about Nugent with\nGootheridge at the inn, and with the servant at Browndown. If Nugent had\nreturned secretly to Dimchurch, one of those two men, in our little\nvillage, must almost certainly have seen him. Neither of them had seen\nhim.\n\nI inferred from this that he had not tried to communicate with her\npersonally. Had he attempted it (more cunningly and more safely) by\nletter?\n\nI went back to the rectory. It was close on the hour which I had\nappointed with Lucilla--now that the responsibility rested on my\nshoulders--for allowing her to use her eyes. On taking off the bandage, I\nnoticed a circumstance which confirmed the conclusion at which I had\nalready arrived. Her eyes deliberately avoided looking into mine.\nSuppressing as well as I could the pain which this new discovery caused\nme, I repeated Grosse's words, prohibiting her from attempting to look\ninto a book, or to use a pen, until he had seen her again.\n\n\"There is no need for him to forbid me to do that,\" she said.\n\n\"Have you attempted it already?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I looked into a little book of engravings,\" she answered. \"But I could\ndistinguish nothing. The lines all mingled together and swam before my\neyes.\"\n\n\"Have you tried to write?\" I asked next. (I was ashamed of myself for\nlaying that trap for her--although the serious necessity of discovering\nwhether she was privately in correspondence with Nugent, might surely\nhave excused it?)\n\n\"No,\" she replied. \"I have not tried to write.\"\n\nShe changed color when she made that answer. It is necessary to own that,\nin putting my question, I was too much excited to call to mind, what I\nshould have remembered in a calmer state. There was no necessity for her\ntrying to use her eyes--even if she was really carrying on a\ncorrespondence which she wished to keep secret from me. Zillah had been\nin the habit of reading her letters to her, before I appeared at the\nrectory; and she could write short notes (as I have already mentioned) by\nfeeling her way on the paper with her finger. Besides, having learnt to\nread by touch (that is to say with raised characters), just as she had\nlearnt to write--even if her eyes had been sufficiently recovered to\nenable her to distinguish small objects, nothing but practice could have\ntaught her to use them for purposes of correspondence.\n\nThese considerations, though they did not strike me at the time, occurred\nto me later in the day, and altered my opinion to a certain extent. I now\ninterpreted the change of color which I had noticed in her as the outward\nsign of suspicion on her side--suspicion that I had a motive of my own in\ninterrogating her. For the rest, my doubts of Nugent remained unmoved.\nTry as I might, I could not divest my mind of the idea that he was\nplaying me false, and that in one way or another he had contrived, not\nonly to communicate with Lucilla, but to persuade her to keep me in\nignorance of what he had done.\n\nI deferred to the next day any attempt at making further discoveries.\n\nThe last thing at night, I had a momentary impulse to question Zillah.\nReflection soon checked it. My experience of the nurse's character told\nme that she would take refuge in flat denial--and would then inform her\nmistress of what had happened. I knew enough of Lucilla to know (after\nwhat had already passed between us) that a quarrel with me would follow.\nThings were bad enough already, without making them worse in that way.\nWhen the morning came, I resolved to keep a watchful eye on the village\npost-office, and on the movements of the nurse.\n\nWhen the morning came, there was a letter for me from abroad.\n\nThe address was in the handwriting of one of my sisters. We usually wrote\nto each other at intervals of a fortnight or three weeks. This letter had\nfollowed its predecessor after an interval of less than one week. What\ndid it mean? Good news or bad?\n\nI opened the letter.\n\nIt enclosed a telegram, announcing that my poor dear father was lying\ndangerously wounded at Marseilles. My sisters had already gone to him:\nthey implored me to follow them without one moment of needless delay. Is\nit necessary to tell the story of this horrible calamity? Of course it\nbegins with a woman and an elopement. Of course it ends with a young man\nand a duel. Have I not told you already?--Papa was so susceptible; Papa\nwas so brave. Oh, dear, dear! the old story over again. You have an\nEnglish proverb: \"What is bred in the bone--\" etcetera, etcetera. Let us\ndrop the veil. I mean, let us end the chapter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-FIRST\n\nA Hard Time for Madame Pratolungo\n\nOUGHT I to have been prepared for the calamity which had now fallen on my\nsisters and myself? If I had looked my own experience of my poor father\nfairly in the face, would it not have been plain to me that the habits of\na life were not likely to be altered at the end of a life? Surely--if I\nhad exerted my intelligence--I might have foreseen that the longer his\nreformation lasted, the nearer he was to a relapse, and the more\nobviously probable it became that he would fail to fulfill the hopeful\nexpectations which I had cherished of his conduct in the future? I grant\nit all. But where are the pattern people who can exert their\nintelligence--when their intelligence points to one conclusion, and their\ninterests to another? Ah, my dear ladies and gentlemen, there is such a\nfine strong foundation of stupidity at the bottom of our common\nhumanity--if we only knew it!\n\nI could feel no hesitation--as soon as I had recovered myself--about what\nit was my duty to do. My duty was to leave Dimchurch in time to catch the\nfast mail-train from London to the Continent, at eight o'clock that\nnight.\n\nAnd leave Lucilla?\n\nYes! not even Lucilla's interests--dearly as I loved her; alarmed as I\nfelt about her--were as sacred as the interests which called me to my\nfather's bedside. I had some hours to spare before it would be necessary\nfor me to leave her. All I could do was to employ those hours in taking\nthe strictest precautions I could think of to protect her in my absence.\nI could not be long parted from her. One way or the other, the miserable\ndoubt whether my father would live or die, would, at his age, soon be\nover.\n\nI sent for her to see me in my room, and showed her my letter.\n\nShe was honestly grieved when she read it. For a moment--when she spoke\nher few words of sympathy--the painful constraint in her manner towards\nme passed away. It returned again, when I announced my intention of\nstarting for France that day, and expressed the regret I felt at being\nobliged to defer our visit to Ramsgate for the present. She not only\nanswered restrainedly (forming, as I fancied, some thought at the moment\nin her own mind)--she left me, with a commonplace excuse. \"You must have\nmuch to think of in this sad affliction: I won't intrude on you any\nlonger. If you want me, you know where to find me.\" With no more than\nthose words, she walked out of the room.\n\nI never remember, at any other time, such a sense of helplessness and\nconfusion as came over me when she had closed the door. I set to work to\npack up the few things I wanted for the journey; feeling instinctively\nthat if I did not occupy myself in doing something, I should break down\naltogether. Accustomed in all the other emergencies of my life, to decide\nrapidly, I was not even clear enough in my mind to see the facts as they\nwere. As to resolving on anything, I was about as capable of doing that\nas the baby in Mrs. Finch's arms.\n\nThe effort of packing aided me to rally a little--but did no more towards\nrestoring me to my customary tone of mind.\n\nI sat down helplessly, when I had done; feeling the serious necessity of\nclearing matters up between Lucilla and myself, before I went away, and\nstill as ignorant as ever how to do it. To my own indescribable disgust,\nI actually felt tears beginning to find their way into my eyes! I had\njust enough of Pratolungo's widow left in me to feel heartily ashamed of\nmyself. Past vicissitudes and dangers, in the days of my republican life\nwith my husband, had made me a sturdy walker--with a gypsy relish (like\nmy little Jicks) for the open air. I snatched up my hat, and went out, to\nsee what exercise would do for me.\n\nI tried the garden. No! the garden was (for some inscrutable reason) not\nbig enough. I had still some hours to spare. I tried the hills next.\n\nTurning towards the left, and passing the church, I heard through the\nopen windows the _boom-boom_ of Reverend Finch's voice, catechizing the\nvillage children. Thank Heaven, he was out of my way at any rate! I\nmounted the hills, hurrying on as fast as I could. The air and the\nmovement cleared my mind. After more than an hour of hard walking, I\nreturned to the rectory, feeling like my old self again.\n\nPerhaps, there were some dregs of irresolution still left in me. Or,\nperhaps, there was some enervating influence in my affliction, which made\nme feel more sensitively than ever the change in the relations between\nLucilla and myself. Having, by this time, resolved to come to a plain\nexplanation, before I left her unprotected at the rectory, I shrank, even\nyet, from confronting a possible repulse, by speaking to her personally.\nTaking a leaf out of poor Oscar's book, I wrote what I wanted to say to\nher in a note.\n\nI rang the bell--once, twice. Nobody answered it.\n\nI went to the kitchen. Zillah was not there. I knocked at the door of her\nbed-room. There was no answer: the bed-room was empty when I looked in.\nAwkward as it would be, I found myself obliged, either to give my note to\nLucilla with my own hand, or to decide on speaking to her, after all.\n\nI could not prevail on myself to speak to her. So I went to her room with\nmy note, and knocked at the door.\n\nHere again there was no reply. I knocked once more--with the same result.\nI looked in. There was no one in the room. On the little table at the\nfoot of the bed, there lay a letter addressed to me. The writing was in\nZillah's hand. But Lucilla had written her name in the corner in the\nusual way, to show that she had dictated the letter to her nurse. A load\nwas lifted off my heart as I took it up. The same idea (I concluded) had\noccurred to her which had occurred to me. She too had shrunk from the\nembarrassment of a personal explanation. She too had written--and was\nkeeping out of the way until her letter had spoken for her, and had\nunited us again as friends before I left the house.\n\nWith these pleasant anticipations, I opened the letter. Judge what I felt\nwhen I found what it really contained.\n\n\n\n\"DEAR MADAME PRATOLUNGO,--You will agree with me, that it is very\nimportant, after what Herr Grosse has said about the recovery of my\nsight, that my visit to Ramsgate should not be delayed. As you are\nunable, through circumstances which I sincerely regret, to accompany me\nto the sea-side, I have determined to go to London to my aunt, Miss\nBatchford, and to ask her to be my companion instead of you. I have had\nexperience enough of her sincere affection for me to be quite sure that\nshe will gladly take the charge of me off your hands. As no time is to be\nlost, I start for London without waiting for your return from your walk\nto wish you good-bye. You so thoroughly understand the necessity of\ndispensing with formal farewells, in cases of emergency, that I am sure\nyou will not feel offended at my taking leave of you in this way. With\nbest wishes for your father's recovery, believe me,\n\n\"Yours very truly,\n\n\"LUCILLA.\n\n\"P. S.--You need be under no apprehension about me. Zillah goes with me\nas far as London; and I shall communicate with Herr Grosse when I arrive\nat my aunt's house.\"\n\n\n\nBut for one sentence in it, I should most assuredly have answered this\ncruel letter by instantly resigning my situation as Lucilla's companion.\n\nThe sentence to which I refer, contained the words which cast in my teeth\nthe excuses that I had made for Oscar's absence. The sarcastic reference\nto my recent connection with a case of emergency, and to my experience of\nthe necessity of dispensing with formal farewells, removed my last\nlingering doubts of Nugent's treachery. I now felt, not suspicion only,\nbut positive conviction that he had communicated with her in his\nbrother's name, and that he had contrived (by some means at which it was\nimpossible for me to guess) so to work on Lucilla's mind--so to excite\nthat indwelling distrust which her blindness had rooted in her\ncharacter--as to destroy her confidence in me for the time being.\n\nArriving at this conclusion, I could still feel compassionately and\ngenerously towards Lucilla. Far from blaming my poor deluded\nsister-friend for her cruel departure and her yet crueler letter, I laid\nthe whole fault on the shoulders of Nugent. Full as my mind was of my own\ntroubles, I could still think of the danger that threatened Lucilla, and\nof the wrong that Oscar had suffered. I could still feel the old glow of\nmy resolution to bring them together again, and still remember (and\ndetermine to pay) the debt I owed to Nugent Dubourg.\n\nIn the turn things had taken, and with the short time still at my\ndisposal, what was I to do next? Assuming that Miss Batchford would\naccompany her niece to Ramsgate, how could I put the necessary obstacle\nin Nugent's way, if he attempted to communicate with Lucilla at the\nsea-side, in my absence?\n\nIt was impossible for me to decide this, unless I first knew whether Miss\nBatchford, as a member of the family, was to be confidentially informed\nof the sad position in which Oscar and Lucilla now stood towards each\nother.\n\nThe person to consult in this difficulty was the rector. As head of the\nhousehold, and in my absence, the responsibility evidently rested with\nReverend Finch.\n\nI went round at once to the other side of the house. If Mr. Finch had\nreturned to the rectory, after the catechizing was over, well and good.\nIf not, I should be obliged to inquire in the village and seek him at the\ncottages of his parishioners. His magnificent voice relieved me from all\nanxiety on this head. The _boom-boom_ which I had last heard in the\nchurch, I now heard again in the study.\n\nWhen I entered the room, Mr. Finch was on his legs, highly excited;\nharanguing Mrs. Finch and the baby, ensconced as usual in a corner. My\nappearance on the scene diverted his flow of language, for the moment, so\nthat it all poured itself out on my unlucky self. (If you recollect that\nthe rector and Lucilla's aunt had been, from time immemorial, on the\nworst of terms--you will be prepared for what is coming. If you have\nforgotten this, look back at my sixth chapter and refresh your memory.)\n\n\"The very person I was going to send for!\" said the Pope of Dimchurch.\n\"Don't excite Mrs. Finch! Don't speak to Mrs. Finch! You shall hear why\ndirectly. Address yourself exclusively to Me. Be calm, Madame Pratolungo!\nyou don't know what has happened. I am here to tell you.\"\n\nI ventured to stop him: mentioning that Lucilla's letter had informed me\nof his daughter's sudden departure for her aunt's house. Mr. Finch waved\naway my answer with his hand, as something too infinitely unimportant to\nbe worthy of a moment's notice.\n\n\"Yes! yes! yes!\" he said. \"You have a superficial acquaintance with the\nfacts. But you are far from being aware of what my daughter's sudden\nremoval of herself from my roof really means. Now don't be frightened,\nMadame Pratolungo! and don't excite Mrs. Finch! (How are you, my dear?\nhow is the child? Both well? Thanks to an overruling Providence, both\nwell.) Now, Madame Pratolungo, attend to this. My daughter's flight--I\nsay flight advisedly: it is nothing less--my daughter's flight from my\nhouse means (I entreat you to be calm!)--means ANOTHER BLOW dealt at me\nby the family of my first wife. Dealt at me,\" repeated Mr. Finch; heating\nhimself with the recollection of his old feud with the Batchfords--\"Dealt\nat me by Miss Batchford (by Lucilla's aunt, Madame Pratolungo) through my\nunoffending second wife, and my innocent child.--Are you sure you are\nwell, my dear? are you sure the infant is well? Thank\nProvidence!--Concentrate your attention, Madame Pratolungo! Your\nattention is wandering. Prompted by Miss Batchford, my daughter has left\nmy roof. Ramsgate is a mere excuse. And how has she left it? Not only\nwithout first seeing Me--I am Nobody! but without showing the slightest\nsympathy for Mrs. Finch's maternal situation. Attired in her traveling\ncostume, my daughter precipitately entered (or to use my wife's graphic\nexpression 'bounced into') the nursery, while Mrs. Finch was\nadministering maternal sustenance to the infant. Under circumstances\nwhich might have touched the heart of a bandit or a savage, my unnatural\ndaughter (remind me, Mrs. Finch; we will have a little Shakespeare\nto-night; I will read _King Lear_), my unnatural daughter announced\nwithout one word of preparation that a domestic affliction would prevent\nyou from accompanying her to Ramsgate.--Grieved, dear Madame Pratolungo,\nto hear of it. Cast your burden on Providence. Bear up, Mrs. Finch; bear\nup--Having startled my wife with this harrowing news, my daughter next\nshocked her by declaring that she was going to leave her father's roof,\nwithout waiting to bid her father good-bye. The catching of a train, you\nwill observe, was (no doubt at Miss Batchford's instigation) of more\nimportance than the parental embrace or the pastoral blessing. Leaving a\nmessage of apology for Me, my heartless child (I use Mrs. Finch's graphic\nlanguage again--you have fair, very fair powers of expression, Mrs.\nFinch)--my heartless child 'bounced out' of the nursery to catch her\ntrain; having, for all she knew, or cared, administered a shock to my\nwife which might have soured the fountain of maternal sustenance at its\nsource. There is where the Blow falls, Madame Pratolungo! How do I know\nthat acid disturbance is not being communicated at this moment, instead\nof wholesome nourishment, between mother and child? I shall prepare you\nan alkaline draught, Mrs. Finch, to be taken after meals. Don't speak;\ndon't move! Give me your pulse. I hold Miss Batchford accountable, Madame\nPratolungo, for whatever happens--my daughter is a mere instrument in the\nhands of my first wife's family. Give me your pulse, Mrs. Finch. I don't\nlike your pulse. Come up-stairs directly. A recumbent position, and\nanother warm bath--under Providence, Madame Pratolungo!--may parry the\nBlow. Would you kindly open the door, and pick up Mrs. Finch's\nhandkerchief? Never mind the novel--the handkerchief.\"\n\nI seized my first opportunity of speaking again, while Mr. Finch was\nconducting his wife (with his arm round her waist) to the door--putting\nthe question which I had been waiting to ask, in this cautious form:\n\n\"Do you propose to communicate, sir, either with your daughter or with\nMiss Batchford, while Lucilla is away from the rectory? My object in\nventuring to ask----\"\n\nBefore I could state my object, Mr. Finch turned round (turning Mrs.\nFinch with him) and surveyed me from head to foot with a look of\nindignant astonishment.\n\n\"Is it possible you can see this double Wreck,\" said Mr. Finch,\nindicating his wife and child, \"and suppose that I would communicate or\nsanction communication of any sort, with the persons who are responsible\nfor it?--My dear! Can you account for Madame Pratolungo's extraordinary\nquestion? Am I to understand (do _you_ understand) that Madame Pratolungo\nis insulting me?\"\n\nIt was useless to try to explain myself. It was useless for Mrs. Finch\n(who had made several abortive efforts to put in a word or two, on her\nown part) to attempt to pacify her husband. All the poor damp lady could\ndo was to beg me to write to her from foreign parts. \"I'm sorry you're in\ntrouble; and I should really be glad to hear from you.\" Mrs. Finch had\nbarely time to say those kind words--before the rector, in a voice of\nthunder, desired me to look at \"that double Wreck, and respect it if I\ndid not respect _him_\"--and with that walked himself, his wife, and his\nbaby out of the room.\n\nHaving gained the object which had brought me into the study, I made no\nattempt to detain him. The little sense the man possessed at the best of\ntimes, was completely upset by the shock which Lucilla's abrupt departure\nhad inflicted on his high opinion of his own importance. That he would\nend in being reconciled to his daughter--before her next subscription to\nthe household expenses fell due--was a matter of downright certainty.\nBut, until that time came, I felt equally sure that he would vindicate\nhis outraged dignity by declining to hold any communication, in person or\nin writing, with Ramsgate. During the short term of my absence from\nEngland, Miss Batchford would be left as ignorant of her niece's perilous\nposition between the twin-brothers, as Lucilla herself. To know this was\nto have gained the information that I wanted. Nothing was left but to set\nmy brains to work at once, and act on it.\n\nHow was I to act on it?\n\nOn the spur of the moment, I could see but one way. If Grosse pronounced\nLucilla's recovery to be complete, before I returned from abroad, the\nbest thing I could do would be to put Miss Batchford in a position to\nreveal the truth in my place--without running any risk of a premature\ndiscovery. In other words, without letting the old lady into the secret,\nbefore the time arrived at which it could be safely divulged.\n\nThis apparently intricate difficulty was easily overcome, by writing two\nletters (before I went away) instead of one.\n\nThe first letter I addressed to Lucilla. Without any reference to her\nbehavior to me, I stated, in the fullest detail and with all needful\ndelicacy, her position between Oscar and Nugent: and referred her for\nproof of the truth of my assertions to her relatives at the rectory. \"I\nleave it entirely to your discretion\" (I added) \"to write me an answer or\nnot. Put the warning which I now give you to the proof; and if you wonder\nwhy it has been so long delayed, apply to Herr Grosse on whom the whole\nresponsibility rests.\" There I ended; being resolved, after the wrong\nthat Lucilla had inflicted on me, to leave my justification to facts. I\nconfess I was too deeply wounded by her conduct--though I _did_ lay all\nthe blame of it on Nugent--to care to say a word in my own defence.\n\nThis letter sealed, I wrote next to Lucilla's aunt.\n\nIt was not an easy matter to address Miss Batchford. The contempt with\nwhich she regarded Mr. Finch's opinions in politics and religion, was\nmore than matched by the strong aversion which she felt for my republican\nopinions. I have already mentioned, far back in these pages, that a\ndispute on politics between the Tory old lady and myself ended in a\nquarrel between us, which closed the doors of her house on me from that\ntime forth. Knowing this, I ventured on writing to her nevertheless,\nbecause I also knew Miss Batchford to be (apart from her furious\nprejudices) a gentlewoman in the best sense of the word; devotedly\nattached to her niece, and quite as capable, when that devotion was\nappealed to, of doing justice to me (apart from _my_ furious prejudices)\nas I was of doing justice to her. Writing in a tone of unaffected\nrespect, and appealing to her forbearance to encourage mine, I requested\nher to hand my letter to Lucilla on the day when the surgeon reported\nthat all further necessity for his attendance had ceased. In the interval\nbefore this happened, I entreated Miss Batchford, in her niece's\ninterests, to consider my letter as a strictly private communication;\nadding, that my sufficient reason for venturing to make this condition\nwould be found in my letter to Lucilla--which I authorized her aunt to\nread as soon as the time had arrived for opening it.\n\nBy this means I had, as I firmly believed, taken the only possible way of\npreventing Nugent Dubourg from doing any serious mischief in my absence.\n\nWhatever his uncontrolled infatuation for Lucilla might lead him to do\nnext, he could proceed to no serious extremities until Grosse pronounced\nher recovery to be complete. On the day when Grosse did that, she would\nreceive my letter, and would discover for herself the abominable\ndeception which had been practiced on her. As to attempting to find\nNugent, no idea of doing this entered my mind. Wherever he might be, at\nhome or abroad, it would be equally useless to appeal to his honor again.\nIt would be degrading myself to speak to him or to trust him. To expose\nhim to Lucilla the moment it became possible was the one thing to be\ndone. I was ready with my letters, one enclosed in the other, when good\nMr. Gootheridge (with whom I had arranged previously) called to drive me\nto Brighton in his light cart. The chaise which he had for hire had been\nalready used to make the same journey by Lucilla and the nurse, and had\nnot yet been returned to the inn. I reached my train before the hour of\nstarting, and arrived in London with a sufficient margin of time to\nspare.\n\nResolved to make sure that no possible mischance could occur, I drove to\nMiss Batchford's house, and saw the cabman give my letter into the\nservant's hands.\n\nIt was a bitter moment when I found myself pulling down my veil, in the\nfear that Lucilla might be at the window and see me! Nobody was visible\nbut the man who answered the door. If pen, ink, and paper had been within\nmy reach at the moment, I think I should have written to her on my own\naccount, after all! As it was, I could only forgive her the injury she\nhad done me. From the bottom of my heart, I forgave her, and longed for\nthe blessed time which should unite us again. In the meanwhile, having\ndone everything that I could to guard and help her, I was now free to\ngive to Oscar all the thoughts that I could spare from my poor misguided\nfather.\n\nBeing bound for the Continent, I determined (though the chances were a\nhundred to one against me) to do all that I could, in my painful\nposition, to discover the place of Oscar's retreat. The weary hours of\nsuspense at my father's bedside would be lightened to me, if I could feel\nthat the search for the lost man was being carried on at my instigation,\nand that from day to day there was a bare possibility of my hearing of\nhim, if there was no more.\n\nThe office of the lawyer whom I had consulted during my previous visit to\nLondon, lay in my way to the terminus. I drove there next, and was\nfortunate enough to find him still at business.\n\nNo tidings had yet been heard of Oscar. The lawyer, however, proved to be\nuseful by giving me a letter of introduction to a person at Marseilles,\naccustomed to conduct difficult confidential inquiries, and having agents\nwhom he could employ in all the great cities of Europe. A man of Oscar's\nstartling personal appearance would be surely more or less easy to trace,\nif the right machinery to do it could only be set at work. My savings\nwould suffice for this purpose to a certain extent--and to that extent I\nresolved that they should be used when I reached my journey's end.\n\nIt was a troubled sea on the channel passage that night. I remained on\ndeck; accepting any inconvenience rather than descend into the atmosphere\nof the cabin. As I looked out to sea on one side and on the other, the\ndark waste of tossing waters seemed to be the fit and dreary type of the\ndark prospect that was before me. On the trackless path that we were\nploughing, a faint misty moonlight shed its doubtful ray. Like the\ndoubtful light of hope, faintly flickering on my mind when I thought of\nthe coming time!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-SECOND\n\nThe Story of Lucilla: told by Herself\n\nIN my description of what Lucilla said and did, on the occasion when the\nsurgeon was teaching her to use her sight, it will be remembered that she\nis represented as having been particularly anxious to be allowed to try\nhow she could write.\n\nThe motive at the bottom of this was the motive which is always at the\nbottom of a woman's conduct when she loves. Her one ambition is to\npresent herself to advantage, even in the most trifling matters, before\nthe man on whom her heart is fixed. Lucilla's one ambition with Oscar,\nwas this and no more.\n\nConscious that her handwriting--thus far, painfully and incompletely\nguided by her sense of touch--must present itself in sadly unfavorable\ncontrast to the handwriting of other women who could see, she persisted\nin petitioning Grosse to permit her to learn to \"write with her eyes\ninstead of her finger,\" until she fairly wearied out the worthy German's\npower of resistance. The rapid improvement in her sight, after her\nremoval to the sea-side, justified him (as I was afterwards informed) in\nletting her have her way. Little by little, using her eyes for a longer\nand longer time on each succeeding day, she mastered the serious\ndifficulty of teaching herself to write by sight instead of by touch.\nBeginning with lines in copybooks, she got on to writing easy words to\ndictation. From that again, she advanced to writing notes; and from\nwriting notes to keeping a journal--this last, at the suggestion of her\naunt, who had lived in the days before penny postage, when people kept\njournals, and wrote long letters--in short, when people had time to think\nof themselves, and, more wonderful still, to write about it too.\n\nLucilla's Journal at Ramsgate lies before me as I trace these lines.\n\nI had planned at first to make use of it, so as to continue the course of\nmy narrative without a check; still writing in my own person--as I have\nwritten thus far; and as I propose to write again, at the time when I\nreappear on the scene.\n\nBut on thinking over it once more, and after reading the Journal again,\nit strikes me as the wiser proceeding to let Lucilla tell the story of\nher life at Ramsgate, herself: adding notes of my own occasionally, where\nthey appear to be required. Variety, freshness, and reality--I believe I\nshall secure them all three by following this plan. Why is History in\ngeneral (I know there are brilliant exceptions to the rule) such dull\nreading? Because it is the narrative of events, written at second hand.\nNow I will be anything else you please, except dull. You may say I have\nbeen dull already? As I am an honest woman, I don't agree with you. There\nare some people who bring dull minds to their reading--and then blame the\nwriter for it. I say no more.\n\nConsider it as arranged, then. During my absence on the Continent,\nLucilla shall tell the story of events at Ramsgate. (And I will sprinkle\na few notes over it, here and there; signed P.)\n\n\n                    Lucilla's Journal\n\n_East Cliff Ramsgate, August_ 28th.--A fortnight to-day since my aunt and\nI arrived at this place. I sent Zillah back to the rectory from London.\nHer rheumatic infirmities trouble her tenfold, poor old soul, in the\nmoist air of the seaside.\n\nHow has my writing got on for the last week? I am becoming a little\nbetter satisfied with it. I use my pen more easily; my hand is less like\nthe hand of a backward child than it was. I shall be able to write as\nwell as other ladies do when I am Oscar's wife.\n\n[Note.--She is easily satisfied, poor dear. Her improved handwriting is\nsadly crooked. Some of the letters embrace each other at close quarters\nlike dear friends; and some start asunder like bitter enemies. This is\nnot to reflect on Lucilla--but to excuse myself, if I make any mistakes\nin transcribing the Journal. Now let her go on.--P.]\n\nOscar's wife! when shall I be Oscar's wife? I have not so much as seen\nhim yet. Something--I am afraid a difficulty with his brother--still\nkeeps him on the Continent. The tone in which he writes continues to have\na certain reserve in it which disquiets and puzzles me. Am I quite as\nhappy as I expected to be when I recovered my sight? Not yet!\n\nIt is not Oscar's fault, if I am out of spirits every now and then. It is\nmy own fault. I have offended my father; and I sometimes fear I have not\nacted justly towards Madame Pratolungo. These things vex me.\n\nIt seems to be my fate to be always misunderstood. My sudden flight from\nthe rectory meant no disrespect to my father. I left as I did, because I\nwas quite incapable of facing the woman whom I had once dearly\nloved--thinking of her as I think now. It is so unendurable to feel that\nyour confidence is lost in a person whom you once trusted without limit,\nand to go on meeting that person every hour in the day with a smooth\nface, as if nothing had happened! The impulse to escape more meetings\n(when I discovered that she had left the house for a walk) was\nirresistible. I should do it again, if I was in the same position again.\nI have hinted at this in writing to my father; telling him that something\nunpleasant had happened between Madame Pratolungo and me, and that I went\naway so suddenly, on that account alone. No use! He has not answered my\nletter. I have written since to my step-mother. Mrs. Finch's reply has\ninformed me of the unjust manner in which he speaks of my aunt. Without\nthe slightest reason for it, he is even more deeply offended with Miss\nBatchford than he is with me!\n\nSad as this estrangement is, there is one consolation--so far as I am\nconcerned, it will not last. My father and I are sure, sooner or later,\nto come to an understanding together. When I return to the rectory, I\nshall make my peace with him, and we shall get on again as smoothly as\never.\n\nBut how will it end between Madame Pratolungo and me?\n\nShe has not answered the letter I wrote to her. (I begin to wish I had\nnever written it, or at least some of it--the latter part I mean.) I have\nheard absolutely nothing of her since she has been abroad. I don't know\nwhen she will return--or if she will ever return, to live at Dimchurch\nagain. Oh, what would I not give to have this dreadful mystery cleared\nup! to know whether I ought to fall down on my knees before her and beg\nher pardon? or whether I ought to count among the saddest days of my life\nthe day which brought that woman to live with me as companion and friend?\n\nHave I acted rashly? or have I acted wisely?\n\nThere is the question which always comes to me and torments me, when I\nwake in the night. Let me look again (for the fiftieth time at least) at\nOscar's letter.\n\n[Note.--I copy the letter. Other eyes than hers ought to see it in this\nplace. It is Nugent, of course, who here writes in Oscar's character and\nin Oscar's name. You will observe that his good resolutions, when he left\nme, held out as far as Paris--and then gave way as follows.--P.]\n\n\"MY OWN DEAREST,--I have reached Paris, and have found my first\nopportunity of writing to you since I left Browndown. Madame Pratolungo\nhas no doubt told you that a sudden necessity has called me to my\nbrother. I have not yet reached the place at which I am to meet him.\nBefore I meet him, let me tell you what the necessity which has parted us\nreally is. Madame Pratolungo no longer possesses my confidence. When you\nhave read on a little farther, she will no longer possess yours.\n\n\"Alas, my love, I must amaze you, shock you, grieve you--I who would lay\ndown my life for your happiness! Let me write it in the fewest words. I\nhave made a terrible discovery. Lucilla! you have trusted Madame\nPratolungo as your friend. Trust her no longer. She is your enemy, and\nmine.\n\n\"I suspected her some time since. My worst suspicions have been\nconfirmed.\n\n\"Long ere this, I ought to have told you, what I tell you now. But I\nshrink from distressing you. To see a sad look on your dear face breaks\nmy heart. It is only when I am away from you--when I fear the\nconsequences if you are not warned of your danger--that I can summon the\ncourage to tear off the mask from that woman's false face, and show her\nto you as she really is. It is impossible for me to enter into details in\nthe space of a letter; I reserve all particulars until we meet again, and\nuntil I can produce, what you have a right to ask for--proof that I am\nspeaking the truth.\n\n\"In the meanwhile, I beg you to look back into your own thoughts, to\nrecall your own words, on the day when Madame Pratolungo offended you in\nthe rectory garden. On that occasion, the truth escaped the Frenchwoman's\nlips--and she knew it!\n\n\"Do you remember what you said, after she had followed you to Browndown?\nI mean, after she had declared that you would have fallen in love with my\nbrother if you had met him first--and after Nugent (at her instigation no\ndoubt) had taken advantage of your blindness to make you believe that you\nwere speaking to _me._ When you were smarting under the insult, and when\nyou had found out the trick, what did you say?\n\n\"You said these--or nearly these--words:\n\n\"'She hated you from the first, Oscar--she took up with your brother\ndirectly he came here. Don't marry me at Dimchurch! Find out some place\nthat they don't know of! They are both in a conspiracy together against\nyou and against me. Take care of them! take care of them!'\n\n\"Lucilla! I echo your own words to you. I return the warning--the\nprophetic warning--which you unconsciously gave me in that past time. I\nam afraid my unhappy brother loves you--and I know for certain that\nMadame Pratolungo feels the interest in _him_ which she has never felt in\n_me._ What you said, I say. They are in a conspiracy together against us.\nTake care of them! take care of them!\n\n\"When we meet again, I shall be prepared to defeat the conspiracy. Till\nthat time comes--as you value your happiness and mine, don't let Madame\nPratolungo suspect that you have discovered her. It is she, I firmly\nbelieve, who is to blame. I am going to my brother--as you will now\nunderstand--with an object far different to the object which I put\nforward as an excuse to your false friend. Fear no dispute between Nugent\nand me. I know him. I firmly believe I shall find that he has been\ntempted and misled. I answer--now that no evil influences are at work on\nhim--for his acting like an honorable man, and deserving your pardon and\nmine. The excuse I have made to Madame Pratolungo will prevent her from\ninterfering between us. That was my one object in making it.\n\n\"Keep me correctly informed of your movements and of hers. I enclose an\naddress to which you can write, with the certainty that your letters will\nbe forwarded.\n\n\"On my side, I promise to write constantly. Once more, don't trust a\nliving creature about you with the secret which this letter reveals!\nExpect me back at the earliest possible moment, to free you--with a\nhusband's authority--from the woman who has so cruelly deceived\nus.--Yours with the truest affection, the fondest love,\n\n\"OSCAR.\"\n\n[Note.--It is quite needless for me to dwell here on the devilish\ncunning--I can use no other phrase--which inspired this abominable\nletter. Look back to the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth chapters, and\nyou will see how skillfully what I said in a moment of foolish\nirritation, and what Lucilla said when she too had lost her temper, is\nturned to account to poison her mind against me. We are made innocently\nto supply our enemy with the foundation on which he builds his plot. For\nthe rest, the letter explains itself. Nugent still persists in\npersonating his brother. He guesses easily at the excuse I should make to\nLucilla for his absence; and he gets over the difficulty of appearing to\nhave confided his errand to a woman whom he distrusts, by declaring that\nhe felt it necessary to deceive me as to what the nature of that errand\nreally was. As the Journal proceeds, you will see how dexterously he\nworks the machinery which his letter has set in motion. All I need add\nhere, in the way of explanation, is--that the delay in his arrival at\nRamsgate of which Lucilla complains, was caused by nothing but his own\nhesitation. His sense of honor--as I knew, from discoveries made at a\nlater time--was not entirely lost yet. The lower he sank, the harder his\nbetter nature struggled to raise him. Nothing, positively nothing, but\nhis own remorse need have kept him at Paris (it is needless to say that\nhe never stirred farther, and never discovered the place of his brother's\nretreat) after Lucilla had informed him by letter, that I had gone\nabroad, and that she was at Ramsgate with her aunt. I have done: let\nLucilla go on again.--P.]\n\nI have read Oscar's letter once more.\n\nHe is the soul of honor; he is incapable of deceiving me. I remember\nsaying what he tells me I said, and thinking it too--for the moment\nonly--when I was beside myself with rage. Still--may it not be possible\nthat appearances have misled Oscar? Oh, Madame Pratolungo! I had such a\nhigh opinion of you, I loved you so dearly--can you have been unworthy of\nthe admiration and affection that you once inspired in me?\n\nI quite agree with Oscar that his brother is not to blame. It is sad and\nshocking that Mr. Nugent Dubourg should have allowed himself to fall in\nlove with me. But I cannot help pitying him. Poor disfigured man, I hope\nhe will get a good wife! How he must have suffered!\n\nIt is impossible to endure, any longer, my present state of suspense.\nOscar must, and shall, satisfy me about Madame Pratolungo--with his own\nlips. I shall write to him by this post, and insist on his coming to\nRamsgate.\n\n_August_ 29th.--I wrote to him yesterday, to the address in Paris. My\nletter will be delivered to-morrow. Where is he? when will he get it?\n\n[Note.--That innocent letter did its fatal mischief. It ended the\nstruggle against himself which had kept Nugent Dubourg in Paris. On the\nmorning when he received it, he started for England. Here is the entry in\nLucilla's journal.--P.]\n\n_August_ 31st.--A telegram for me at breakfast-time. I am too happy to\nkeep my hand steady--I am writing horribly. It doesn't matter: nothing\nmatters but my telegram. (Oh, what a noble creature the man was who\ninvented telegrams!) Oscar is on his way to Ramsgate!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-THIRD\n\nLucilla's Journal, continued\n\n_September_ 1st.\n\nI AM composed enough to return to my Journal, and to let my mind dwell a\nlittle on all that I have thought and felt since Oscar has been here.\n\nNow that I have lost Madame Pratolungo, I have no friend with whom I can\ntalk over my little secrets. My aunt is all that is kind and good to me;\nbut with a person so much older than I am--who has lived in such a\ndifferent world from my world, and whose ideas seem to be so far away\nfrom mine--how can I talk about my follies and extravagances, and expect\nsympathy in return! My one confidential friend is my Journal--I can only\ntalk about myself to myself, in these pages. My position feels sometimes\nlike a very lonely one. I saw two girls telling all their secrets to each\nother on the sands to-day--and I am afraid I envied them.\n\nWell, my dear Journal, how did I feel--after longing for Oscar--when\nOscar came to me? It is dreadful to own it; but my book locks up, and my\nbook can be trusted with the truth. I felt ready to cry--I was so\nunexpectedly, so horribly, disappointed.\n\nNo. \"Disappointed\" is not the word. I can't find the word. There was a\nmoment--I hardly dare write it: it seems so atrociously wicked--there was\na moment when I actually wished myself blind again.\n\nHe took me in his arms; he held my hand in his. In the time when I was\nblind, how I should have felt it! how the delicious _tingle_ would have\nrun through me when he touched me! Nothing of the kind happened now. He\nmight have been Oscar's brother for all the effect he produced on me. I\nhave myself taken his hand since, and shut my eyes to try and renew my\nblindness, and put myself back completely as I was in the old time. The\nsame result still. Nothing, nothing, nothing!\n\nIs it that he is a little restrained with me on his side? He certainly\nis! I felt it the moment he came into the room--I have felt it ever\nsince.\n\nNo: it is not that. In the old time, when we were only beginning to love\neach other, he was restrained with me. But it made no difference then. I\nwas not the insensible creature in those days that I have become since.\n\nI can only account for it in one way. The restoration of my sight has\nmade a new creature of me. I have gained a sense--I am no longer the same\nwoman. This great change must have had some influence over me that I\nnever suspected until Oscar came here. Can the loss of my sense of\nfeeling be the price that I have paid for the recovery of my sense of\nsight?\n\nWhen Grosse comes next, I shall put that question to him.\n\nIn the meanwhile, I have had a second disappointment. He is not nearly so\nbeautiful as I thought he was when I was blind.\n\nOn the day when my bandage was taken off for the first time, I could only\nsee indistinctly. When I ran into the room at the rectory, I guessed it\nwas Oscar rather than knew it was Oscar. My father's grey head, and Mrs.\nFinch's woman's dress, would no doubt have helped anybody in my place to\nfix as I did on the right man. But this is all different now. I can see\nhis features in detail--and the result is (though I won't own it to any\nof them) that I find my idea of him in the days of my blindness--oh, so\nunlike the reality! The one thing that is not a disappointment to me, is\nhis voice. When he cannot see me, I close my eyes, and let my ears feel\nthe old charm again--so far.\n\nAnd this is what I have gained, by submitting to the operation, and\nenduring my imprisonment in the darkened room!\n\nWhat am I writing? I ought to be ashamed of myself! Is it nothing to have\nhad all the beauty of land and sea, all the glory of cloud and sunshine,\nrevealed to me? Is it nothing to be able to look at my\nfellow-creatures--to see the bright faces of children smile at me when I\nspeak to them? Enough of myself! I am unhappy and ungrateful when I think\nof myself.\n\nLet me write about Oscar.\n\nMy aunt approves of him. She thinks him handsome, and says he has the\nmanners of a gentleman. This last is high praise from Miss Batchford. She\ndespises the present generation of young men. \"In my time,\" she said the\nother day, \"I used to see young gentlemen. I only see young animals now;\nwell-fed, well-washed, well-dressed; riding animals, rowing animals,\nbetting animals--nothing more.\"\n\nOscar, on his side, seems to like Miss Batchford on better acquaintance.\nWhen I first presented him to her, he rather surprised me by changing\ncolor and looking very uneasy. He is almost distressingly nervous, on\ncertain occasions. I suppose my aunt's grand manner daunted him.\n\n[Note.--I really must break in here. Her aunt's \"grand manner\" makes me\nsick. It is nothing (between ourselves) but a hook-nose and a stiff pair\nof stays. What daunted Nugent Dubourg, when he first found himself in the\nold lady's presence, was the fear of discovery. He would no doubt have\nlearnt from his brother that Oscar and Miss Batchford had never met. You\nwill see, if you look back, that it was, in the nature of things,\nimpossible they should have met. But is it equally clear that Nugent\ncould find out beforehand that Miss Batchford had been left in ignorance\nof what had happened at Dimchurch? He could do nothing of the sort--he\ncould feel no assurance of his security from exposure, until he had tried\nthe ground in his own proper person first. The risk here was certainly\nserious enough to make even Nugent Dubourg feel uneasy. And Lucilla talks\nof her aunt's \"grand manner!\" Poor innocent! I leave her to go on.--P.]\n\nAs soon as my aunt left us together, the first words I said to Oscar,\nreferred (of course) to his letter about Madame Pratolungo.\n\nHe made a little sign of entreaty, and looked distressed.\n\n\"Why should we spoil the pleasure of our first meeting by talking of\nher?\" he said. \"It is so inexpressibly painful to you and to me. Let us\nreturn to it in a day or two. Not now, Lucilla--not now!\"\n\nHis brother was the next subject in my mind. I was not at all sure how he\nwould take my speaking about it. I risked a question however, for all\nthat. He made another sign of entreaty, and looked distressed again.\n\n\"My brother and I understand each other, Lucilla. He will remain abroad\nfor the present. Shall we drop that subject, too? Let me hear your own\nnews--I want to know what is going on at the rectory. I have heard\nnothing since you wrote me word that you were here with your aunt, and\nthat Madame Pratolungo had gone abroad to her father. Is Mr. Finch well?\nIs he coming to Ramsgate to see you?\"\n\nI was unwilling to tell him of the misunderstanding at home. \"I have not\nheard from my father since I have been here,\" I said. \"Now you have come\nback, I can write and announce your return, and get all the news from the\nrectory.\"\n\nHe looked at me rather strangely--in a way which led me to fear that he\nsaw some objection to my writing to my father.\n\n\"I suppose you would like Mr. Finch to come here?\" he said--and then\nstopped suddenly, and looked at me again.\n\n\"There is very little chance of his coming here,\" I answered.\n\nOscar seemed to be wonderfully interested about my father. \"Very little\nchance!\" he repeated. \"Why?\"\n\nI was obliged to refer to the family quarrel--still, however, saying\nnothing of the unjust manner in which my father had spoken of my aunt.\n\n\"As long as I am with Miss Batchford,\" I said, \"it is useless to hope\nthat my father will come here. They are on bad terms; and I am afraid\nthere is no prospect, at present, of their being friends again. Do you\nobject to my writing home to say you have come to Ramsgate?\" I asked.\n\n\"I?\" he exclaimed, looking the picture of astonishment. \"What could\npossibly make you think that? Write by all means--and leave a little\nspace for me. I will add a few lines to your letter.\"\n\nIt is impossible to say how his answer relieved me. It was quite plain\nthat I had stupidly misinterpreted him. Oh, my new eyes! my new eyes!\nshall I ever be able to depend on you as I could once depend on my touch?\n\n[Note.--I must intrude myself again. I shall burst with indignation while\nI am copying the journal, if I don't relieve my mind at certain places in\nit. Remark, before you go any farther, how skillfully Nugent contrives to\nascertain his exact position at Ramsgate--and see with what a fatal\nunanimity all the chances of his personating Oscar, without discovery,\ndeclare themselves in his favor! Miss Batchford, as you have seen, is\nentirely at his mercy. She not only knows nothing herself, but she\noperates as a check on Mr. Finch--who would otherwise have joined his\ndaughter at Ramsgate, and have instantly exposed the conspiracy. On every\nside of him, Nugent is, to all appearance, safe. I am away in one\ndirection. Oscar is away in another. Mrs. Finch is anchored immovably in\nher nursery. Zillah has been sent back from London to the rectory. The\nDimchurch doctor (who attended Oscar, and who might have proved an\nawkward witness) is settled in India--as you will see, if you refer to\nthe twenty-second chapter. The London doctor with whom he consulted has\nlong since ceased to have any relations with his former patient. As for\nHerr Grosse, if he appears on the scene, he can be trusted to shut his\neyes professionally to all that is going on, and to let matters take\ntheir course in the only interest he recognizes--the interest of\nLucilla's health. There is literally no obstacle in Nugent's way--and no\nsort of protection for Lucilla, except in the faithful instinct which\npersists in warning her that this is the wrong man--though it speaks in\nan unknown tongue. Will she end in understanding the warning before it is\ntoo late? My friend, this note is intended to relieve my mind--not yours.\nAll you have to do is to read on. Here is the journal. I won't stand\nanother moment in your way.--P.]\n\n_September_ 2nd.--A rainy day. Very little said that is worth recording\nbetween Oscar and me.\n\nMy aunt, whose spirits are always affected by bad weather, kept me a long\ntime in her sitting-room, amusing herself by making me exercise my sight.\nOscar was present by special invitation, and assisted the old lady in\nsetting this new seeing-sense of mine all sorts of tasks. He tried hard\nto prevail on me to let him see my writing. I refused. It is improving as\nfast as it can; but it is not good enough yet.\n\nI notice here what a dreadfully difficult thing it is to get back--in\nsuch a case as mine--to the exercise of one's sight.\n\nWe have a cat and a dog in the house. Would it be credited, if I was\ntelling it to the world instead of telling it to my Journal, that I\nactually mistook one for the other to-day?--after seeing so well, too, as\nI do now, and being able to write with so few false strokes in making my\nletters! It is nevertheless true that I did mistake the two animals;\nhaving trusted to nothing but my memory to inform my eyes which was\nwhich, instead of helping my memory by my touch. I have now set this\nright. I caught up puss, and shut my eyes (oh, that habit! when shall I\nget over it?) and felt her soft fur (so different from a dog's hair!) and\nopened my eyes again, and associated the feel of the fur for ever\nafterwards with the sight of a cat.\n\nTo-day's experience has also informed me that I make slow progress in\nteaching myself to judge correctly of distances.\n\nIn spite of this drawback, however, there is nothing I enjoy so much in\nusing my sight as looking at a great wide prospect of any kind--provided\nI am not asked to judge how far or how near objects may be. It seems like\nescaping out of prison, to look (after having been shut up in my\nblindness) at the view over the town, and the bold promontory of the\npier, and the grand sweep of the sea beyond--all visible from our\nwindows.\n\nThe moment my aunt begins to question me about distances, she makes a\ntoil of my pleasure. It is worse still when I am asked about the relative\nsizes of ships and boats. When I see nothing but a boat, I fancy it\nlarger than it is. When I see the boat in comparison with a ship, and\nthen look back at the boat, I instantly go to the other extreme, and\nfancy it smaller than it is. The setting this right still vexes me almost\nas keenly as my stupidity vexed me some time since, when I saw my first\nhorse and cart from an upper window, and took it for a dog drawing a\nwheelbarrow! Let me add in my own defence that both horse and cart were\nfigured at least five times their proper size in my blind fancy, which\nmakes my mistake, I think, not so very stupid after all.\n\nWell, I amused my aunt. And what effect did I produce on Oscar?\n\nIf I could trust my eyes, I should say I produced exactly the contrary\neffect on _him_--I made him melancholy. But I don't trust my eyes. They\nmust be deceiving me when they tell me that he looked, in my company, a\nmoping, anxious, miserable man.\n\nOr is it, that he sees and feels something changed in Me? I could scream\nwith vexation and rage against myself. Here is my Oscar--and yet he is\nnot the Oscar I knew when I was blind. Contradictory as it seems, I used\nto understand how he looked at me, when I was unable to see it. Now that\nI can see it, I ask myself, Is this really love that is looking at me in\nhis eyes? or is it something else? How should I know? I knew when I had\nonly my own fancy to tell me. But now, try as I may, I cannot make the\nold fancy and the new sight serve me in harmony both together. I am\nafraid he sees that I don't understand him. Oh, dear! dear! why did I not\nmeet my good old Grosse, and become the new creature that he has made me,\nbefore I met Oscar? I should have had no blind memories and\nprepossessions to get over then. I shall become used to my new self, I\nhope and believe, with time--and that will accustom me to my new\nimpressions of Oscar--and so it may all come right in the end. It is all\nwrong enough now. He put his arm round me, and gave me a little tender\nsqueeze, while we were following Miss Batchford down to the dining-room\nthis afternoon. Nothing in me answered to it. I should have felt it all\nover me a few months since.\n\nHere is a tear on the paper. What a fool I am! Why can't I write about\nsomething else?\n\nI sent my second letter to my father to-day; telling him of Oscar's\nreturn from abroad, and taking no notice of his not having replied to my\nfirst letter. The only way to manage my father is not to take notice, and\nto let him come right by himself. I showed Oscar my letter--with a space\nleft at the end for his postscript. While he was writing it, he asked me\nto get something which happened to be up-stairs in my room. When I came\nback, he had sealed the envelope--forgetting to show me his postscript.\nIt was not worth while to open the letter again; he told me what he had\nwritten, and that did just as well.\n\n[Note.--I must trouble you with a copy of what Nugent really did write.\nIt shows why he sent her out of the room, and closed the envelope before\nshe could come back. The postscript is also worthy of notice, in this\nrespect--that it plays a part in a page of my narrative which is still to\ncome.\n\nThus Nugent writes, in Oscar's name and character, to the rector of\nDimchurch. (I have already mentioned, as you will see in the\ntwenty-second chapter, that a close similarity of handwriting was one\namong the other striking points of resemblance between the twins.)\n\n\"DEAR MR. FINCH,\n\n\"Lucilla's letter will have told you that I have come to my senses, and\nthat I am again paying my addresses to her as her affianced husband. My\nprincipal object in adding these lines is to propose that we should\nforget the past, and go on again as if nothing had happened.\n\n\"Nugent has behaved nobly. He absolves me from the engagements towards\nhim into which I so rashly entered, at our last interview before I left\nBrowndown. Most generously and amply he has redeemed his pledge to Madame\nPratolungo to discover the place of my retreat and to restore me to\nLucilla. For the present he remains abroad.\n\n\"If you favor me with a reply to this, I must warn you to be careful how\nyou write; for Lucilla is sure to ask to see your letter. Remember that\nshe only supposes me to have returned to her after a brief absence from\nEngland, caused by a necessity for joining my brother on the Continent.\nIt will be also desirable to say nothing on the subject of my unfortunate\npeculiarity of complexion. I have made it all right with Lucilla, and she\nis getting accustomed to me. Still, the subject is a sore one; and the\nless it is referred to the better.\n\nTruly yours,\n\n\"OSCAR.\"\n\n\nUnless I add a word of explanation here, you will hardly appreciate the\nextraordinary skillfulness with which the deception is continued by means\nof this postscript.\n\nWritten in Oscar's character (and representing Nugent as having done all\nthat he had promised me to do) it designedly omits the customary courtesy\nof Oscar's style. The object of this is to offend Mr. Finch--with what\nend in view you will presently see. The rector was the last man in\nexistence to dispense with the necessary apologies and expressions of\nregret from a man engaged to his daughter, who had left her as Oscar had\nleft her--no matter how the circumstances might appear to excuse him. The\ncurt, off-hand postscript signed \"Oscar\" was the very thing to exasperate\nthe wound already inflicted on Mr. Finch's self-esteem, and to render it\nat least probable that he would reconsider his intention of himself\nperforming the marriage ceremony. In the event of his refusal, what would\nhappen? A stranger, entirely ignorant of which was Nugent and which was\nOscar, would officiate in his place. Do you see it now?\n\nBut even the cleverest people are not always capable of providing for\nevery emergency. The completest plot generally has its weak place.\n\nThe postscript, as you have seen, was a little masterpiece. But it\nnevertheless exposed the writer to a danger which (as the Journal will\ntell you) he only appreciated at its true value when it was too late to\nalter his mind. Finding himself forced, for the sake of appearances, to\npermit Lucilla to inform her father of his arrival at Ramsgate, he was\nnow obliged to run the risk of having that important piece of domestic\nnews communicated--either by Mr. Finch or by his wife--to no less a\nperson than myself. You will remember that worthy Mrs. Finch, when we\nparted at the rectory, had asked me to write to her while I was\nabroad--and you will see, after the hint I have given you, that clever\nMr. Nugent is beginning already to walk upon delicate ground. I say no\nmore: Lucilla's turn now.--P.]\n\n_September_ 3rd.--Oscar has (I suppose) forgotten something which he\nought to have included in his postscript to my letter.\n\nMore than two hours after I had sent it to the post, he asked if the\nletter had gone. For the moment, he looked annoyed when I said, Yes. But\nhe soon recovered himself. It mattered nothing (he said); he could easily\nwrite again. \"Talking of letters,\" he added, \"do you expect Madame\nPratolungo to write to you?\" (This time it was he who referred to her!) I\ntold him that there was not much chance, after what had passed on her\nside and on mine, of her writing to me--and then tried to put some of\nthose questions about her which he had once already requested me not to\npress yet. For the second time, he entreated me to defer the discussion\nof that unpleasant subject for the present--and yet, with a curious\ninconsistency, he made another inquiry relating to the subject in the\nsame breath.\n\n\"Do you think she is likely to be in correspondence with your father, or\nyour stepmother, while she is out of England?\" he asked.\n\n\"I should doubt her writing to my father,\" I said. \"But she might\ncorrespond with Mrs. Finch.\"\n\nHe considered a little--and then turned the talk to the topic of our\nresidence at Ramsgate next.\n\n\"How long do you stay here?\" he inquired.\n\n\"It depends on Herr Grosse,\" I answered. \"I will ask him when he comes\nnext.\"\n\nHe turned away to the window--suddenly, as if he was a little put out.\n\n\"Are you tired of Ramsgate already?\" I asked.\n\nHe came back to me, and took my hand--my cold insensible hand that won't\nfeel his touch as it ought!\n\n\"Let me be your husband, Lucilla,\" he whispered; \"and I will live at\nRamsgate if you like--for your sake.\"\n\nAlthough there was everything to please me in those words, there was\nsomething that startled me--I cannot describe it--in his look and manner\nwhen he said them. I made no answer at the moment. He went on.\n\n\"Why should we not be married at once?\" he asked. \"We are both of age. We\nhave only ourselves to think of.\"\n\n[Note.--Alter his words as follows: \"Why should we not be married before\nMadame Pratolungo can hear of my arrival at Ramsgate?\"--and you will\nrightly interpret his motives. The situation is now fast reaching its\nclimax of peril. Nugent's one chance is to persuade Lucilla to marry him\nbefore any discoveries can reach my ears, and before Grosse considers her\nsufficiently recovered to leave Ramsgate.--P.]\n\n\"You forget,\" I answered, more surprised than ever; \"we have my father to\nthink of. It was always arranged that he was to marry us at Dimchurch.\"\n\nOscar smiled--not at all the charming smile I used to imagine, when I was\nblind!\n\n\"We shall wait a long time, I am afraid,\" he said, \"if we wait until your\nfather marries us.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\" I asked.\n\n\"When we enter on the painful subject of Madame Pratolungo,\" he replied,\n\"I will tell you. In the meantime, do you think Mr. Finch will answer\nyour letter?\"\n\n\"I hope so.\"\n\n\"Do you think he will answer my postscript?\"\n\n\"I am sure he will!\"\n\nThe same unpleasant smile showed itself again in his face. He abruptly\ndropped the conversation, and went to play _piquet_ with my aunt.\n\nAll this happened yesterday evening. I went to bed, sadly dissatisfied\nwith somebody. Was it with Oscar? or with myself? or with both? I fancy\nwith both.\n\nTo-day, we went out together for a walk on the cliffs. What a delight it\nwas to move through the fresh briny air, and see the lovely sights on\nevery side of me! Oscar enjoyed it too. All through the first part of our\nwalk, he was charming, and I was more in love with him than ever. On our\nreturn, a little incident occurred which altered him for the worse, and\nwhich made my spirits sink again.\n\nIt happened in this manner.\n\nI proposed returning by the sands. Ramsgate is still crowded with\nvisitors; and the animated scene on the beach in the later part of the\nday has attractions for me, after my blind life, which it does not (I\ndare say) possess for people who have always enjoyed the use of their\neyes. Oscar, who has a nervous horror of crowds, and who shrinks from\ncontact with people not so refined as himself, was surprised at my\nwishing to mix with what he called \"the mob on the sands.\" However, he\nsaid he would go, if I particularly wished it. I did particularly wish\nit. So we went.\n\nThere were chairs on the beach. We hired two, and sat down to look about\nus.\n\nAll sorts of diversions were going on. Monkeys, organs, girls on stilts,\na conjurer, and a troop of negro minstrels, were all at work to amuse the\nvisitors. I thought the varied color and bustling enjoyment of the crowd,\nwith the bright blue sea beyond, and the glorious sunshine overhead,\nquite delightful--I declare I felt as if two eyes were not half enough to\nsee with! A nice old lady, sitting near, entered into conversation with\nme; hospitably offering me biscuits and sherry out of her own bag. Oscar,\nto my disappointment, looked quite disgusted with all of us. He thought\nmy nice old lady vulgar; and he called the company on the beach \"a herd\nof snobs.\" While he was still muttering under his breath about the\n\"mixture of low people,\" he suddenly cast a side-look at some person or\nthing--I could not at the moment tell which--and, rising, placed himself\nso as to intercept my view of the promenade on the sands immediately\nbefore me. I happened to have noticed, at the same moment, a lady\napproaching us in a dress of a peculiar color; and I pulled Oscar on one\nside, to look at her as she passed in front of me. \"Why do you get in my\nway?\" I asked. Before he could answer the question the lady passed, with\ntwo lovely children, and with a tall man at her side. My eyes, looking\nfirst at the lady and the children, found their way next to the\ngentleman--and saw repeated in his face, the same black-blue complexion\nwhich had startled me in the face of Oscar's brother, when I first opened\nmy eyes at the rectory! For the moment I felt startled again--more, as I\nbelieve, by the unexpected repetition of the blue face in the face of a\nstranger, than by the ugliness of the complexion itself. At any rate, I\nwas composed enough to admire the lady's dress, and the beauty of the\nchildren, before they had passed beyond my range of view. Oscar spoke to\nme, while I was looking at them, in a tone of reproach for which, as I\nthought, there was no occasion and no excuse.\n\n\"I tried to spare you,\" he said. \"You have yourself to thank, if that man\nhas frightened you.\"\n\n\"He has _not_ frightened me,\" I answered--sharply enough.\n\nOscar looked at me very attentively; and sat down again, without saying a\nword more.\n\nThe good-humoured old woman, on my other side, who had seen and heard all\nthat had passed, began to talk of the gentleman with the discolored face,\nand of the lady and the children who accompanied him. He was a retired\nIndian officer, she said. The lady was his wife, and the two beautiful\nchildren were his own children. \"It seems a pity that such a handsome man\nshould be disfigured in that way,\" my new acquaintance remarked. \"But\nstill, it don't matter much, after all. There he is, as you see, with a\nfine woman for a wife, and with two lovely children. I know the landlady\nof the house where they lodge--and a happier family you couldn't lay your\nhand on in all England. That is my friend's account of them. Even a blue\nface don't seem such a dreadful misfortune, when you look at it in that\nlight--does it, Miss?\"\n\nI entirely agreed with the old lady. Our talk seemed, for some\nincomprehensible reason, to irritate Oscar. He got up again impatiently,\nand looked at his watch.\n\n\"Your aunt will be wondering what has become of us,\" he said. \"Surely you\nhave had enough of the mob on the sands, by this time?\"\n\nI had not had enough of it, and I should have been quite content to have\nmade one of the mob for some time longer. But I saw that Oscar would be\nseriously vexed if I persisted in keeping my place. So I took leave of my\nnice old lady, and left the pleasant sands--not very willingly.\n\nHe said nothing more, until we had threaded our way out of the crowd.\nThen he returned, without any reason for it that I could discover, to the\nsubject of the Indian officer, and to the remembrance which the\nstranger's complexion must have awakened in me of his brother's face.\n\n\"I don't understand your telling me you were not frightened when you saw\nthat man,\" he said. \"You were terribly frightened by my brother, when you\nsaw him.\"\n\n\"I was terribly frightened by my own imagination, _before_ I saw him,\" I\nanswered. \"_After_ I saw him, I soon got over it.\"\n\n\"So you say!\" he rejoined.\n\nThere is something excessively provoking--at least to me--in being told\nto my face that I have said something which is not worthy of belief. It\nwas not a very becoming act on my part (after what he had told me in his\nletter about his brother's infatuation) to mention his brother. I ought\nnot to have done it. I did it, for all that.\n\n\"I say what I mean,\" I replied. \"Before I knew what you told me about\nyour brother, I was going to propose to you, for your sake and for his,\nthat he should live with us after we were married.\"\n\nOscar suddenly stopped. He had given me his arm to lead me through the\ncrowd--he dropped it now.\n\n\"You say that, because you are angry with me!\" he said.\n\nI denied being angry with him; I declared, once more, that I was only\nspeaking the truth.\n\n\"You really mean,\" he went on, \"that you could have lived comfortably\nwith my brother's blue face before you every hour of the day?\"\n\n\"Quite comfortably--if he would have been my brother too.\" Oscar pointed\nto the house in which my aunt and I are living--within a few yards of the\nplace on which we stood.\n\n\"You are close at home,\" he said, speaking in an odd muffled voice, with\nhis eyes on the ground. \"I want a longer walk. We shall meet at\ndinner-time.\"\n\nHe left me--without looking up, and without saying a word more.\n\nJealous of his brother! There is something unnatural, something degrading\nin such jealousy as that. I am ashamed of myself for thinking it of him.\nAnd yet what else could his conduct mean?\n\n[Note.--It is for me to answer that question. Give the miserable wretch\nhis due. His conduct meant, in one plain word--remorse. The only excuse\nleft that he could make to his own conscience for the infamous part which\nhe was playing, was this--that his brother's personal disfigurement\npresented a fatal obstacle in the way of his brother's marriage. And now\nLucilla's own words, Lucilla's own actions, had told him that Oscar's\nface was no obstacle to her seeing Oscar perpetually in the familiar\nintercourse of domestic life. The torture of self-reproach which this\ndiscovery inflicted on him, drove him out of her presence. His own lips\nwould have betrayed him, if he had spoken a word more to her at that\nmoment. This is no speculation of mine. I know what I am now writing to\nbe the truth.--P.]\n\nIt is night again. I am in my bed-room--too nervous and too anxious to go\nto rest yet. Let me employ myself in finishing this private record of the\nevents of the day.\n\nOscar came a little before dinner-time; haggard and pale, and so absent\nin mind that he hardly seemed to know what he was talking about. No\nexplanations passed between us. He asked my pardon for the hard things he\nhad said, and the ill-temper he had shown, earlier in the day. I readily\naccepted his excuses--and did my best to conceal the uneasiness which his\nvacant, pre-occupied manner caused me. All the time he was speaking to\nme, he was plainly thinking of something else--he was more unlike the\nOscar of my blind remembrances than ever. It was the old voice talking in\na new way: I can only describe it to myself in those terms.\n\nAs for his manner, I know it used to be always more or less quiet and\nretiring in the old days: but was it ever so hopelessly subdued and\ndepressed, as I have seen it to-day? Useless to ask! In the by-gone time,\nI was not able to see it. My past judgment of him and my present judgment\nof him have been arrived at by such totally different means, that it\nseems useless to compare them. Oh, how I miss Madame Pratolungo! What a\nrelief, what a consolation it would have been, to have said all this to\nher, and to have heard what she thought of it in return!\n\nThere is, however, a chance of my finding my way out of some of my\nperplexities, at any rate--if I can only wait till tomorrow.\n\nOscar seems to have made up his mind at last to enter into the\nexplanations which he has hitherto withheld from me. He has asked me to\ngive him a private interview in the morning. The circumstances which led\nto his making this request have highly excited my curiosity. Something is\nevidently going on under the surface, in which my interests are\nconcerned--and, possibly, Oscar's interests too.\n\nIt all came about in this way.\n\nOn returning to the house, after Oscar had left me, I found that a letter\nfrom Grosse had arrived by the afternoon post. My dear old surgeon wrote\nto say that he was coming to see me--and added in a postscript that he\nwould arrive the next day at luncheon-time. Past experience told me that\nthis meant a demand on my aunt's housekeeping for all the good things\nthat it could produce. (Ah, dear! I thought of Madame Pratolungo and the\nMayonnaise. Will those times never come again?) Well--at dinner, I\nannounced Grosse's visit; adding significantly, \"at luncheon-time.\"\n\nMy aunt looked up from her plate with a little start--not interested, as\nI was prepared to hear, in the serious question of luncheon, but in the\nopinion which my medical adviser was likely to give of the state of my\nhealth.\n\n\"I am anxious to hear what Mr. Grosse says about you to-morrow,\" the old\nlady began. \"I shall insist on his giving me a far more complete report\nof you than he gave last time. The recovery of your sight appears to me,\nmy dear, to be quite complete.\"\n\n\"Do you want me to be cured, aunt, because you want to get away?\" I\nasked. \"Are you weary of Ramsgate?\"\n\nMiss Batchford's quick temper flashed at me out of Miss Batchford's\nbright old eyes.\n\n\"I am weary of keeping a letter of yours,\" she answered, with a look of\ndisgust.\n\n\"A letter of mine!\" I exclaimed.\n\n\"Yes. A letter which is only to be given to you, when Mr. Grosse\npronounces that you are quite yourself again.\"\n\nOscar--who had not taken the slightest interest in the conversation thus\nfar--suddenly stopped, with his fork half way to his mouth; changed\ncolor; and looked eagerly at my aunt.\n\n\"What letter?\" I asked. \"Who gave it to you? Why am I not to see it until\nI am quite myself again?\"\n\nMiss Batchford obstinately shook her head three times, in answer to those\nthree questions.\n\n\"I hate secrets and mysteries,\" she said impatiently. \"This is a secret\nand a mystery--and I long to have done with it. That is all. I have said\ntoo much already. I shall say no more.\"\n\nAll my entreaties were of no avail. My aunt's quick temper had evidently\nled her into committing an imprudence of some sort. Having done that, she\nwas now provokingly determined not to make bad worse. Nothing that I\ncould say would induce her to open her lips on the subject of the\nmysterious letter. \"Wait till Mr. Grosse comes to-morrow.\" That was the\nonly reply I could get.\n\nAs for Oscar, this little incident appeared to have an effect on him\nwhich added immensely to the curiosity that my aunt had roused in me.\n\nHe listened with breathless attention while I was trying to induce Miss\nBatchford to answer my questions. When I gave it up, he pushed away his\nplate, and ate no more. On the other hand (though generally the most\ntemperate of men) he drank a great deal of wine, both at dinner and\nafter. In the evening, he made so many mistakes in playing cards with my\naunt, that she dismissed him from the game in disgrace. He sat in a\ncorner for the rest of the time, pretending to listen while I was playing\nthe piano--really lost to me and my music; buried, fathoms deep, in some\nuneasy thoughts of his own.\n\nWhen he took his leave, he whispered these words in my ear; anxiously\npressing my hand while he spoke:\n\n\"I must see you alone to-morrow, before Grosse comes. Can you manage it?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"At the stairs on the cliff, at eleven o'clock.\"\n\nOn that, he left me. But one question has pursued me ever since. Does\nOscar know the writer of the mysterious letter? I firmly believe he does.\nTo-morrow will prove whether I am right or wrong. How I long for\nto-morrow to come!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-FOURTH\n\nLucilla's Journal, continued\n\n_September_ 4th.\n\nI MARK this day as one of the saddest days of my life. Oscar has shown\nMadame Pratolungo to me, in her true colors. He has reasoned out this\nmiserable matter with a plainness which it is impossible for me to\nresist. I have thrown away my love and my confidence on a false woman:\nthere is no sense of honor, no feeling of gratitude or of delicacy in her\nnature. And I once thought her--it sickens me to recall it! I will see\nher no more.\n\n[Note.--Did it ever occur to you to be obliged to copy out, with your own\nhand, this sort of opinion of your own character? I can recommend the\nsensation produced as something quite new, and the temptation to add a\nline or two on your own account to be as nearly as possible beyond mortal\nresistance.--P.]\n\nOscar and I met at the stairs, at eleven o'clock, as we had arranged.\n\nHe took me to the west pier. At that hour of the morning (excepting a few\nsailors who paid no heed to us) the place was a solitude. It was one of\nthe loveliest days of the season. When we were tired of pacing to and\nfro, we could sit down under the mellow sunshine, and enjoy the balmy sea\nair. In that pure light, with all those lovely colors about us, there was\nsomething, to my mind, horribly and shamefully out of place in the talk\nthat engrossed us--talk that still turned, hour after hour, on nothing\nbut plots and lies, cruelty, ingratitude, and deceit!\n\nI managed to ask my first question so as to make him enter on the subject\nat once--without wasting time in phrases to prepare me for what was to\ncome.\n\n\"When my aunt mentioned that letter at dinner yesterday,\" I said, \"I\nfancied that you knew something about it. Was I right?\"\n\n\"Very nearly right,\" he answered. \"I can't say I knew anything about it.\nI only suspected that it was the production of an enemy of yours and\nmine.\"\n\n\"Not Madame Pratolungo?\"\n\n\"Yes! Madame Pratolungo.\"\n\nI disagreed with him at the outset. Madame Pratolungo and my aunt had\nquarreled about politics. Any correspondence between them--a confidential\ncorrespondence especially--seemed to be one of the most unlikely things\nthat could take place. I asked Oscar if he could guess what the letter\ncontained, and why it was not to be given to me until Grosse reported\nthat I was quite cured.\n\n\"I can't guess at the contents--I can only guess at the object of the\nletter,\" he said.\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"The object which she has had in view from the first--to place every\npossible obstacle in the way of my marrying you.\"\n\n\"What interest can she have in doing that?\"\n\n\"My brother's interest.\"\n\n\"Forgive me, Oscar. I cannot believe it of her.\"\n\nWe were walking, while these words were passing between us. When I said\nthat, he stopped, and looked at me very earnestly.\n\n\"You believed it of her, when you answered my letter,\" he said.\n\nI admitted that.\n\n\"I believed your letter,\" I replied; \"and I shared your opinion of her as\nlong as she was in the same house with me. Her presence fed my anger and\nmy horror of her in some way that I can't account for. Now she has left\nme--now I have had time to think--there is something in her absence that\npleads for her, and tortures me with doubts if I have done right. I can't\nexplain it--I don't understand it. I only know that so it is.\"\n\nHe still looked at me more and more attentively. \"Your good opinion of\nher must have been very firmly rooted to assert itself in this obstinate\nmanner,\" he said. \"What can she have done to deserve it?\"\n\nIf I had looked back through all my old recollections of her, and had\nrecalled them one by one, it would only have ended in making me cry. And\nyet, I felt that I ought to stand up for her as long as I could. I\nmanaged to meet the difficulty in this way.\n\n\"I will tell you what she did,\" I said, \"after I received your letter.\nFortunately for me, she was not very well that morning; and she\nbreakfasted in bed. I had plenty of time to compose myself, and to\ncaution Zillah (who read your letter to me), before we met for the first\ntime that day. On the previous day, I had felt hurt and offended with her\nfor the manner in which she accounted for your absence from Browndown. I\nthought she was not treating me with the same confidence which I should\nhave placed in her, if our positions had been reversed. When I next saw\nher, having your warning in my mind, I made my excuses, and said what I\nthought she would expect me to say, under the circumstances. In my\nexcitement and my wretchedness, I daresay I over-acted my part. At any\nrate, I roused the suspicion in her that something was wrong. She not\nonly asked me if anything had happened, she went the length of saying, in\nso many words, that she thought she saw a change in me. I stopped it\nthere, by declaring that I did not understand her. She must have seen\nthat I was not telling the truth: she must have known as well as I knew\nthat I was concealing something from her. For all that, not one word more\nescaped her lips. A proud delicacy--I saw it as plainly in her face, as I\nnow see you--a proud delicacy silenced her; she looked wounded and hurt.\nI have been thinking of that look, since I have been here. I have asked\nmyself (what did not occur to me at the time) if a false woman, who knew\nherself to be guilty, would have behaved in that way? Surely a false\nwoman would have set her wits against mine, and have tried to lead me\ninto betraying to her what discoveries I had really made? Oscar! that\ndelicate silence, that wounded look, _will_ plead for her when I think of\nher in her absence! I can _not_ feel as satisfied as I once did, that she\nis the abominable creature you declare her to be. I know you are\nincapable of deceiving me--I know you believe what you say. But is it not\npossible that appearances have misled you? Can you really be sure that\nyou have not made some dreadful mistake?\"\n\nWithout answering me, he suddenly stopped at a seat under the stone\nparapet of the pier, and signed to me to sit down by him. I obeyed.\nInstead of looking at me, he kept his head turned away; looking out over\nthe sea. I could not make him out. He perplexed--he almost alarmed me.\n\n\"Have I offended you?\" I asked.\n\nHe turned towards me again, as abruptly as he had turned away. His eyes\nwandered; his face was pale.\n\n\"You are a good generous creature,\" he said, in a confused hasty way.\n\"Let us talk of something else.\"\n\n\"No!\" I answered. \"I am too deeply interested in knowing the truth to\ntalk of anything else.\"\n\nHis color changed again at that. His face flushed; he gave a heavy sigh\nas one does sometimes, when one is making a great effort.\n\n\"You _will_ have it?\" he said.\n\n\"I _will_ have it?\"\n\nHe rose again. The nearer he was to telling me all that he had kept\nconcealed from me thus far, the harder it seemed to be to him to say the\nfirst words.\n\n\"Do you mind walking on again?\" he asked.\n\nI silently rose on my side, and put my arm in his. We walked on slowly\ntowards the end of the pier. Arrived there, he stood still, and spoke\nthose hard first words--looking out over the broad blue waters: not\nlooking at me.\n\n\"I won't ask you to take anything for granted, on my assertion only,\" he\nbegan. \"The woman's own words, the woman's own actions, shall prove her\nguilty.\"\n\nI interrupted him by a question.\n\n\"Tell me one thing,\" I said. \"What first made you suspect her?\"\n\n\"You first made me suspect her, by what you said of her at Browndown,\" he\nanswered. \"Now carry your memory back to the time I have already\nmentioned in my letter--when she betrayed herself to you in the rectory\ngarden. Is it true that she said you would have fallen in love with\nNugent, if you had met him first instead of me?\"\n\n\"It is true that she said it,\" I answered. \"At a moment,\" I added, \"when\nher temper had got the better of her--and when mine had got the better of\nme.\"\n\n\"Advance the hour a little,\" he went on, \"to the time when she followed\nyou to Browndown. Was she still out of temper, when she made her excuses\nto you?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Did she interfere, when Nugent took advantage of your blindness to make\nyou believe you were talking to me?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"Was she out of temper then?\"\n\nI still defended her. \"She might well have been angry,\" I said. \"She had\nmade her excuses to me in the kindest manner; and I had received them\nwith the most unpardonable rudeness.\"\n\nMy defence produced no effect on him. He summed it up coolly so far. \"She\ncompared me disadvantageously with Nugent; and she allowed Nugent to\npersonate me in speaking to you, without interfering to stop it. In both\nthese cases, her temper excuses and accounts for her conduct. Very good.\nWe may, or may not, differ so far. Before we go farther, let us--if we\ncan--agree on one unanswerable fact. Which of us two brothers was her\nfavorite, from the first?\"\n\nAbout _that,_ there could be no doubt. I admitted at once that Nugent was\nher favorite. And more than this, I remembered accusing her myself of\nnever having done justice to Oscar from the first.\n\n[Note.--See the sixteenth chapter, and Madame Pratolungo's remark,\nwarning you that you would hear of this circumstance again.--P.]\n\nOscar went on.\n\n\"Bear that in mind,\" he said. \"And now let us get to the time when we\nwere assembled in your sitting-room, to discuss the subject of the\noperation on your eyes. The question before us, as I remember it, was\nthis. Were you to marry me, before the operation? Or were you to keep me\nwaiting until the operation had been performed, and the cure was\ncomplete? How did Madame Pratolungo decide on that occasion? She decided\nagainst my interests; she encouraged you to delay our marriage.\"\n\nI persisted in defending her. \"She did that out of sympathy with me,\" I\nsaid.\n\nHe surprised me by again accepting my view of the matter, without\nattempting to dispute it.\n\n\"We will say she did it out of sympathy with you,\" he proceeded.\n\"Whatever her motives might be, the result was the same. My marriage to\nyou was indefinitely put off; and Madame Pratolungo voted for that\ndelay.\"\n\n\"And your brother,\" I added, \"took the other side, and tried to persuade\nme to marry you first. How can you reconcile that with what you have told\nme----\"\n\nHe interposed before I could say more. \"Don't bring my brother into the\ninquiry,\" he said. \"My brother, at that time, could still behave like an\nhonorable man, and sacrifice his own feelings to his duty to me. Let us\nstrictly confine ourselves, for the present, to what Madame Pratolungo\nsaid and did. And let us advance again to a few minutes later on the same\nday, when our little domestic debate had ended. My brother was the first\nto go. Then, you retired, and left Madame Pratolungo and me alone in the\nroom. Do you remember?\"\n\nI remembered perfectly.\n\n\"You had bitterly disappointed me,\" I said. \"You had shown no sympathy\nwith my eagerness to be restored to the blessing of sight. You made\nobjections and started difficulties. I recollect speaking to you with\nsome of the bitterness that I felt--blaming you for not believing in my\nfuture as I believed in it, and hoping as I hoped--and then leaving you,\nand locking myself up in my own room.\"\n\nIn those terms, I satisfied him that my memory of the events of that day\nwas as clear as his own. He listened without making any remark, and went\non when I had done.\n\n\"Madame Pratolungo shared your hard opinion of me, on that occasion,\" he\nproceeded; \"and expressed it in infinitely stronger terms. She betrayed\nherself to _you_ in the rectory garden. She betrayed herself to _me,_\nafter you had left us together in the sitting-room. Her hasty temper\nagain, beyond all doubt! I quite agree with you. What she said to me in\nyour absence, she would never have said if she had been mistress of\nherself.\"\n\nI began to feel a little startled. \"How is it that you now tell me of\nthis for the first time?\" I said. \"Were you afraid of distressing me?\"\n\n\"I was afraid of losing you,\" he answered.\n\nHitherto, I had kept my arm in his. I drew it out now. If his reply meant\nanything, it meant that he had once thought me capable of breaking faith\nwith him. He saw that I was hurt.\n\n\"Remember,\" he said, \"that I had unhappily offended you that day, and\nthat you have not heard yet what Madame Pratolungo had the audacity to\nsay to me under those circumstances.\"\n\n\"What did she say to you?\"\n\n\"This:--'It would have been a happier prospect for Lucilla, if she had\nbeen going to marry your brother, instead of marrying you.' I repeat\nliterally: those were the words.\"\n\nI could no more believe it of her than I could have believed it of\nmyself.\n\n\"Are you really sure?\" I asked him. \"_Can_ she have said anything so\ncruel to you as that?\"\n\nInstead of answering me, he took his pocket-book from the breast-pocket\nof his coat--searched in it--and produced a morsel of folded and crumpled\npaper. He opened the paper, and showed me some writing inside.\n\n\"Is that my writing?\" he asked.\n\nIt was his writing. I had seen enough of his letters, since the recovery\nof my sight, to feel sure of that.\n\n\"Read it!\" he said; \"and judge for yourself.\"\n\n[Note.--You have made your acquaintance with this letter already, in my\nthirty-second chapter. I had said those foolish words to Oscar (as you\nwill find in my record of the time), under the influence of a natural\nindignation, which any other woman with a spark of spirit in her would\nhave felt in my place. Instead of personally remonstrating with me, Oscar\nhad (as usual) gone home, and written me a letter of expostulation.\nHaving, on my side, had time to cool--and feeling the absurdity of our\nexchanging letters when we were within a few minutes' walk of each\nother--I had gone straight to Browndown, on receiving the letter: first\ncrumpling it up, and (as I supposed) throwing it into the fire. After\npersonally setting myself right with Oscar, I had returned to the\nrectory; and had there heard that Nugent had been to see me in my\nabsence, had waited a little while alone in the sitting-room, and had\ngone away again. When I tell you that the letter which he was now showing\nto Lucilla, was that same letter of Oscar's, which I had (as I believed)\ndestroyed, you will understand that I had thrown it into the fender\ninstead of into the fire; and that I failed to see it in the fender on my\nreturn, simply because Nugent had seen it first, and had taken it away\nwith him. These particulars are described in greater detail in the\nchapter to which I have referred; the letter itself being there inserted\nat full length. However, I will save you the trouble of looking back--I\nknow how you hate trouble!--by transcribing literally what I find before\nme in the Journal. The original letter is pasted on the page: I will copy\nit from the page for the second time. Am I not good to you? What author\nby profession would do as much for you as this? I am afraid I am praising\nmyself! Let Lucilla proceed.--P.]\n\nI took the letter from him and read it. At my request, he has permitted\nme to keep it. The letter is my justification for thinking of Madame\nPratolungo as I now think of her. I place it here, before I write another\nline in my Journal.\n\n\n\n\"MADAME PRATOLUNGO,--You have distressed and pained me more than I can\nsay. There are faults, and serious ones, on my side, I know. I heartily\nbeg your pardon for anything that I may have said or done to offend you.\nI cannot submit to your hard verdict on me. If you knew how I adore\nLucilla, you would make allowances for me--you would understand me better\nthan you do. I cannot get your last cruel words out of my ears. I cannot\nmeet you again without some explanation of them. You stabbed me to the\nheart, when you said this evening that it would be a happier prospect for\nLucilla if she had been going to marry my brother instead of marrying me.\nI hope you did not really mean that? Will you please write and tell me\nwhether you did or not?\n\n\"OSCAR.\"\n\nMy first proceeding, after reading those lines, was of course to put my\narm again in his, and to draw him as close to me as close could be. My\nsecond proceeding followed in due time. I asked, naturally, for Madame\nPratolungo's answer to that most affectionate and most touching letter.\n\n\"I have no answer to show you,\" he said.\n\n\"You have lost it?\" I asked.\n\n\"I never had it.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Madame Pratolungo never answered my letter.\"\n\nI made him repeat that--once, twice. Was it not incredible that such an\nappeal could be made to any woman not utterly depraved--and be left\nunnoticed? Twice he reiterated the same answer. Twice he declared on his\nhonor that not a line of reply had been returned to him. She was then\nutterly depraved? No! there was a last excuse left that justice and\nfriendship might still make for her. I made it.\n\n\"There is but one explanation of her conduct,\" I said. \"She never\nreceived the letter. Where did you send it to?\"\n\n\"To the rectory.\"\n\n\"Who took it?\"\n\n\"My own servant.\"\n\n\"He may have lost it on the way, and have been afraid to tell you. Or the\nservant at the rectory may have forgotten to deliver it.\"\n\nOscar shook his head. \"Quite impossible! I know Madame Pratolungo\nreceived the letter.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"I found it crumpled up in a corner inside the fender, _in your\nsitting-room at the rectory._\"\n\n\"Had it been opened?\"\n\n\"It had been opened. She had received it; she had read it; and she had\nnot thrown quite far enough to throw it into the fire. Now, Lucilla! Is\nMadame Pratolungo an injured woman? and am I a man who has slandered\nher?\"\n\nThere was another public seat, a few paces distant from us. I could stand\nno longer. I went away by myself and sat down. A dull sensation possessed\nme. I could neither speak, nor cry. There I sat in silence; slowly\nwringing my hands in my lap, and feeling the last ties that still bound\nme to the once-loved friend of former days, falling away one after the\nother, and leaving us parted for life.\n\nHe followed me, and stood over me--he summed her up in stern quiet tones,\nwhich carried conviction into my mind, and made me feel ashamed of myself\nfor having ever regretted her.\n\n\"Look back for the last time, Lucilla, at what this woman has said and\ndone. You will find that the idea of your marrying Nugent is, under one\nform or another, always present to her mind. Present alike when she\nforgets herself, and speaks in a rage--or when she reflects, and speaks\nwith a purpose. At one time, she tells you that you would have fallen in\nlove with Nugent, if you had seen him first. At another time, she stands\nby while Nugent is personating me to you, and never interferes to stop\nit. On a third occasion, she sees that you are offended with me; and\ntriumphs so cruelly in seeing it, that she tells me to my face, your\nprospect would have been a much happier one, if you had been engaged to\nmarry my brother instead of me. She is asked in writing, civilly and\nkindly asked, to explain what she means by those abominable words? She\nhas had time to reflect since she spoke them; and what does she do? Does\nshe answer me? No! She contemptuously tosses my letter into the\nfire-place. Add to these plain facts what you yourself have observed.\nNugent has all her admiration; Nugent is her favorite: from the first,\nshe has always disliked and wronged _me._ Add to this, again, that Nugent\n(as I know for certain) privately confessed to her that he was himself in\nlove with you. Look at all these circumstances--and what plain conclusion\nfollows? I ask you once more--Is Madame Pratolungo a slandered woman? or\nam I right in warning you (as you once warned me) to beware of her?\"\n\nWhat could I do but own that he was right? It was due to him, and due to\nme, to close my heart to her, from that moment. Oscar sat down by me, and\ntook my hand.\n\n\"After my experience of her in the past,\" he went on softly, \"can you\nwonder that I dread what she may do in the future? Has no such thing ever\nhappened as the parting of true lovers by treachery which has secretly\nundermined their confidence in each other. Is Madame Pratolungo not\nclever enough and unscrupulous enough to undermine _our_ confidence, and\nto turn against us, to the wickedest purpose, the influence which she\nalready possesses at the rectory? How do we know that she is not in\ncommunication with Nugent at this moment?\"\n\nI stopped him there--I could not endure it. \"You have seen your brother,\"\nI said. \"You have told me that you and he understand each other. What\nhave you to dread after that?\"\n\n\"I have to dread Madame Pratolungo's influence, and my brother's\ninfatuation for you,\" he answered. \"The promises which he has honestly\nmade to me, are promises which I cannot depend on when my back is turned,\nand when Madame Pratolungo may be with him in my absence. Something under\nthe surface is going on already! I don't like that mysterious letter,\nwhich is only to be shown to you on certain conditions. I don't like your\nfather's silence. He has had time to answer your letter. Has he done it?\nHe has had time to answer my postscript. Has he done it?\"\n\nThose were awkward questions. He had certainly left both our letters\nunanswered--thus far. Still, the next post might bring his reply. I\npersisted in taking this view; and I said so to Oscar. He persisted just\nas obstinately on his side.\n\n\"Suppose we go on to the end of the week,\" he said; \"and still no letter\nfrom your father comes, for you, or for me? Will you admit, _then,_ that\nhis silence is suspicious?\"\n\n\"I will admit that his silence shows a sad want of proper consideration\nfor _you,_\" I replied.\n\n\"And there you will stop? You won't see (what I see) the influence of\nMadame Pratolungo making itself felt at the rectory, and poisoning your\nfather's mind against our marriage?\"\n\nHe was pressing me rather hardly. I did my best, however, to tell him\nhonestly what was passing in my mind.\n\n\"I can see,\" I said, \"that Madame Pratolungo has behaved most cruelly to\nyou. And I believe, after what you have told me, that she would rejoice\nif I broke my engagement, and married your brother. But I can _not_\nunderstand that she is mad enough to be actually plotting to make me do\nit. Nobody knows better than she does how faithfully I love you, and how\nhopeless it would be to attempt to make me marry another man. Would the\nstupidest woman living, who looked at you two brothers (knowing what she\nknows), be stupid enough to do what you suspect Madame Pratolungo of\ndoing?\"\n\nI thought this unanswerable. He had his reply to it ready, for all that.\n\n\"If you had seen more of the world, Lucilla,\" he said, \"you would know\nthat a true love like yours is a mystery to a woman like Madame\nPratolungo. She doesn't believe in it--she doesn't understand it. She\nknows herself to be capable of breaking any engagement, if the\ncircumstances encouraged her--and she estimates your fidelity by her\nknowledge of her own nature. There is nothing in her experience of you,\nor in her knowledge of my brother's disfigurement, to discourage such a\nwoman from scheming to part us. She has seen for herself--what you have\nalready told me--that you have got over your first aversion to him. She\nknows that women as charming as you are, have over and over again married\nmen far more personally repulsive than my brother. Lucilla! something\nwhich is not to be out-argued, and not to be contradicted, tells me that\nher return to England will be fatal to my hopes, if that return finds you\nand me with no closer tie between us than the tie that binds us now. Are\nthese fanciful apprehensions, unworthy of a man? My darling! worthy or\nnot worthy, you ought to make allowances for them. They are apprehensions\ninspired by my love for You!\"\n\nUnder those circumstances, I could make every allowance for him--and I\nsaid so. He moved nearer to me; and put his arm round me.\n\n\"Are we not engaged to each other to be man and wife?\" he whispered.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are we not both of age, and both free to do as we like?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Would you relieve me from the anxieties under which I am suffering, if\nyou could?\"\n\n\"You know I would!\"\n\n\"You _can_ relieve me.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"By giving me a husband's claim to you, Lucilla--by consenting to marry\nme in London, in a fortnight's time.\"\n\nI started back, and looked at him in amazement. For the moment, I was\nincapable of answering in any other way than that.\n\n\"I ask you to do nothing unworthy of you,\" he said. \"I have spoken to a\nrelative of mine living near London--a married lady--whose house is open\nto you in the interval before our wedding day. When your visit has been\nprolonged over a fortnight only, we can be married. Write home by all\nmeans to prevent them from feeling anxious about you. Tell them that you\nare safe and happy, and under responsible and respectable care--but say\nno more. As long as it is possible for Madame Pratolungo to make mischief\nbetween us, conceal the place in which you are living. The instant we are\nmarried reveal everything. Let all your friends--let all the world know\nthat we are man and wife!\"\n\nHis arm trembled round me; his face flushed deep; his eyes devoured me.\nSome women, in my place, might have been offended; others might have been\nflattered. As for me--I can trust the secret to these pages--I was\nfrightened.\n\n\"Is it an elopement that you are proposing to me?\" I asked.\n\n\"An elopement!\" he repeated. \"Between two engaged people who have only\nthemselves to think of.\"\n\n\"I have my father to think of; and my aunt to think of,\" I said. \"You are\nproposing to me to run away from them, and to keep in hiding from them!\"\n\n\"I am asking you to pay a fortnight's visit at the house of a married\nlady--and to keep the knowledge of that visit from the ears of the worst\nenemy you have, until you have become my wife,\" he answered. \"Is there\nanything so very terrible in my request that you should turn pale at it,\nand look at me in that frightened way? Have I not courted you with your\nfather's consent? Am I not your promised husband? Are we not free to\ndecide for ourselves? There is literally no reason--if it could be\ndone--why we should not be married to-morrow. And you still hesitate?\nLucilla! Lucilla! you force me to own the doubt that has made me\nmiserable ever since I have been here. Are you indeed as changed towards\nme as you seem? Do you really no longer love me as you once loved me in\nthe days that are gone?\"\n\nHe rose, and walked away a few paces, leaning over the parapet with his\nface in his hands.\n\nI sat alone, not knowing what to say or do. The uneasy sense in me that\nhe had reason to complain of my treating him coldly, was not to be\ndismissed from my mind by any effort that I could make. He had no right\nto expect me to take the step which he had proposed--there were\nobjections to it which any woman would have felt in my place. Still,\nthough I was satisfied of this, there was an obstinate something in me\nwhich would take his part. It could not have been my conscience surely\nwhich said to me--'There was a time when his entreaties would have\nprevailed on you; there was a time when you would not have hesitated as\nyou are hesitating now?'\n\nWhatever the influence was, it moved me to rise from my seat, and to join\nhim at the parapet.\n\n\"You cannot expect me to decide on such a serious matter as this at\nonce,\" I said. \"Will you give me a little time to think?\"\n\n\"You are your own mistress,\" he rejoined bitterly. \"Why ask me to give you\ntime? You can take any time you please--you can do as you like.\"\n\n\"Give me till the end of the week,\" I went on. \"Let me be sure that my\nfather persists in not answering either your letter or mine. Though I\n_am_ my own mistress, nothing but his silence can justify me in going\naway secretly, and being married to you by a stranger. Don't press me,\nOscar! It isn't very long to the end of the week.\"\n\nSomething seemed to startle him--something in my voice perhaps which told\nhim that I was really distressed. He looked round at me quickly, and\ncaught me with the tears in my eyes.\n\n\"Don't cry, for God's sake!\" he said. \"It shall be as you wish. Take your\ntime. We will say no more about it till the end of the week.\"\n\nHe kissed me in a hurried startled way, and gave me his arm to walk back.\n\n\"Grosse is coming to-day,\" he continued. \"He mustn't see you looking as\nyou are looking now. You must rest and compose yourself. Come home.\"\n\nI went back with him, feeling--oh, so sad and sore at heart! My last\nfaint hope of a renewal of my once-pleasant intimacy with Madame\nPratolungo was at an end. She stood revealed to me now as a woman whom I\nought never to have known--a woman with whom I could never again exchange\na friendly word. I had lost the companion with whom I had once been so\nhappy; and I had pained and disappointed Oscar. My life has never looked\nso wretched and so worthless to me as it looked to-day on the pier at\nRamsgate.\n\nHe left me at the door, with a gentle encouraging pressure of my hand.\n\n\"I will call again later,\" he said; \"and hear what Grosse's report of you\nis, before he goes back to London. Rest, Lucilla--rest and compose\nyourself.\"\n\nA heavy footstep sounded suddenly behind us as he spoke. We both turned\nround. Time had slipped by more rapidly than we had thought. There stood\nHerr Grosse, just arrived on foot from the railway station.\n\nHis first look at me seemed to startle and disappoint him. His eyes\nstared into mine through his spectacles with an expression of surprise\nand anxiety which I had never seen in them before. Then he turned his\nhead and looked at Oscar with a sudden change--a change, unpleasantly\nsuggestive (to my fancy) of anger or distrust. Not a word fell from his\nlips. Oscar was left to break the awkward silence. He spoke to Grosse.\n\n\"I won't disturb you and your patient now,\" he said. \"I will come back in\nan hour's time.\"\n\n\"No! you will come in along with me, if you please. I have something, my\nyoung gentlemans, that I may want to say to you.\" He spoke with a frown\non his bushy eyebrows, and pointed in a very peremptory manner to the\nhouse-door.\n\nOscar rang the bell. At the same moment my aunt, hearing us outside,\nappeared on the balcony above the door.\n\n\"Good morning, Mr. Grosse,\" she said. \"I hope you find Lucilla looking\nher best. Only yesterday, I expressed my opinion that she was quite well\nagain.\"\n\nGrosse took off his hat sulkily to my aunt, and looked back again at\nme--looked so hard and so long, that he began to confuse me.\n\n\"Your aunt's opinions is not my opinions,\" he growled, close at my ear.\n\"I don't like the looks of you, Miss. Go in!\"\n\nThe servant was waiting for us at the open door. I went an without making\nany answer. Grosse waited to see Oscar enter the house before him.\nOscar's face darkened as he joined me in the hall. He looked half angry,\nhalf confused. Grosse pushed himself roughly between us, and gave me his\narm. I went up-stairs with him, wondering what it all meant.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-FIFTH\n\nLucilla's Journal, concluded\n\n_September_ 4th _(continued)._\n\nARRIVED in the drawing-room, Grosse placed me in a chair near the window.\nHe leaned forward, and looked at me close; he drew back, and looked at me\nfrom a distance; he took out his magnifying glass, and had a long stare\nthrough it at my eyes; he felt my pulse; dropped my wrist as if it\ndisgusted him; and, turning to the window, looked out in grim silence,\nwithout taking the slightest notice of any one in the room.\n\nMy aunt was the first person who spoke, under these discouraging\ncircumstances.\n\n\"Mr. Grosse!\" she said sharply. \"Have you nothing to tell me about your\npatient to-day? Do you find Lucilla----\"\n\nHe turned suddenly round from the window, and interrupted Miss Batchford\nwithout the slightest ceremony.\n\n\"I find her gone back, back, back!\" he growled, getting louder and louder\nat each repetition of the word. \"When I sent her here, I said--'Keep her\ncomfortable-easy.' You have not kept her comfortable-easy. Something has\nturned her poor little mind topsy-turvies. What is it? Who is it?\" He\nlooked fiercely backwards and forwards between Oscar and my aunt--then\nturned my way, and putting his heavy hands on my shoulders, looked down\nat me with an odd angry kind of pity in his face. \"My childs is\nmelancholick; my childs is ill,\" he went on. \"Where is our goot-dear\nPratolungo? What did you tell me about her, my little-lofe, when I last\nsaw you? You said she had gone aways to see her Papa. Send a\ntelegrams--and say I want Pratolungo here.\"\n\nAt the repetition of Madame Pratolungo's name, Miss Batchford rose to her\nfeet and stood (apparently) several inches higher than usual.\n\n\"Am I to understand, sir,\" inquired the old lady, \"that your\nextraordinary language is intended to cast a reproach on my conduct\ntowards my niece?\"\n\n\"You are to understand this, madam. In the face of the goot sea-airs,\nMiss your niece is fretting herself ill. I sent her to this place, for to\nget a rosy face, for to put on a firm flesh. How do I find her? She has\ngot nothing, she has put on nothing--she is emphatically flabby-pale. In\nthis fine airs, she can be flabby-pale but for one reason. She is\nfretting herself about something or anodder. Is fretting herself goot for\nher eyes? Ho-damn-damn! it is as bad for her eyes as bad can be. If you\ncan do no better than this, take her aways back again. You are wasting\nyour moneys in this lodgment here.\"\n\nMy aunt addressed herself to me in her grandest manner.\n\n\"You will understand, Lucilla, that it is impossible for me to notice\nsuch language as this in any other way than by leaving the room. If you\ncan bring Mr. Grosse to his senses, inform him that I will receive his\napologies and explanations in writing.\" Pronouncing these lofty words\nwith her severest emphasis, Miss Batchford rose another inch, and sailed\nmajestically out of the room.\n\nGrosse took no notice of the offended lady: he only put his hands in his\npockets, and looked out of window once more. As the door closed, Oscar\nleft the corner in which he had seated himself, not over-graciously, when\nwe entered the room.\n\n\"Am I wanted here?\" he asked.\n\nGrosse was on the point of answering the question even less amiably than\nit had been put--when I stopped him by a look. \"I want to speak to you,\"\nI whispered in his ear. He nodded, and, turning sharply to Oscar, put\nthis question to him:\n\n\"Are you living in the house?\"\n\n\"I am staying at the hotel at the corner.\"\n\n\"Go to the hotel, and wait there till I come to you.\"\n\nGreatly to my surprise, Oscar submitted to be treated in this peremptory\nmanner. He took his leave of me silently, and left the room. Grosse drew\na chair close to mine, and sat down by me in a comforting confidential\nfatherly way.\n\n\"Now my goot-girls,\" he said. \"What have you been fretting yourself about\nsince I was last in this house? Open it all, if you please, to Papa\nGrosse. Come begin-begin!\"\n\nI suppose he had exhausted his ill-temper on my aunt and Oscar. He said\nthose words--more than kindly--almost tenderly. His fierce eyes seemed to\nsoften behind his spectacles; he took my hand and patted it to encourage\nme.\n\nThere are some things written in these pages of mine which it was, of\ncourse, impossible for me to confide to him. With those necessary\nreservations--and without entering on the painful subject of my altered\nrelations with Madame Pratolungo--I owned quite frankly how sadly changed\nI felt myself to be towards Oscar, and how much less happy I was with\nhim, in consequence of the change. \"I am not ill as you suppose,\" I\nexplained. \"I am only disappointed in myself, and a little downhearted\nwhen I think of the future.\" Having opened it to him in this way, I\nthought it time to put the question which I had determined to ask when I\nnext saw him.\n\n\"The restoration of my sight,\" I said, \"has made a new being of me. In\ngaining the sense of seeing, have I lost the sense of feeling which I had\nwhen I was blind? I want to know if it will come back when I have got\nused to the novelty of my position? I want to know if I shall ever enjoy\nOscar's society again, as I used to enjoy it in the old days before you\ncured me--the happy days, Papa-Grosse, when I was an object of pity, and\nwhen all the people spoke of me as Poor Miss Finch?\"\n\nI had more to say--but at this place, Grosse (without meaning it, I am\nsure) suddenly stopped me. To my amazement, he let go of my hand, and\nturned his face away sharply, as if he resented my looking at him. His\nbig head sank on his breast. He lifted his great hairy hands, shook them\nmournfully, and let them fall on his knees. This strange behavior and the\nstill stranger silence which accompanied it, made me so uneasy that I\ninsisted on his explaining himself. \"What is the matter with you?\" I\nsaid. \"Why don't you answer me?\"\n\nHe roused himself with a start, and put his arm round me, with a\nwonderful gentleness for a man who was so rough at other times.\n\n\"It is nothing, my pretty lofe,\" he said. \"I am out of sort, as you call\nit. Your English climates sometimes gives your English blue devil to\nforeign mens like me. I have got him now--an English blue devil in a\nGerman inside. Soh! I shall go and walk him out, and come back\nempty-cheerful, and see you again.\" He rose, after this curious\nexplanation, and attempted some sort of answer--a very odd one--to the\nquestion which I had asked of him. \"As to that odder thing,\" he went on,\n\"yes-indeed-yes. You have hit your nail on his head. It is, as you say,\nyour seeings which has got in the way of your feelings. When your\nseeings-feelings has got used to one anodder, your seeings will stay\nwhere he is, your feelings will come back to where they was; one will\nbalance the odder; you will feel as you did; you will see as you didn't;\nall at the same times, all jolly-nice again as before. You have my\nopinions. Now let me walk out my blue devil. I swear to come back again\nwith a new inside. By-bye-my-Feench-good-bye.\"\n\nSaying all this in a violent hurry, as if he was eager to get away, he\ngave me a kiss on the forehead, snatched up his shabby hat, and ran out\nof the room.\n\nWhat did it mean?\n\nDoes he persist in thinking me seriously ill? I am too weary to puzzle my\nbrains in the effort to understand my dear old surgeon. It is one o'clock\nin the morning; and I have still to write the story of all that happened\nlater in the day. My eyes are beginning to ache; and, strange to say, I\nhave hardly been able to see the last two or three lines I have written.\nThey look as if the ink was fading from them. If Grosse knew what I am\nabout at this moment! His last words to me, when he went back to his\npatients in London, were:--\"No more readings! no more writings till I\ncome again!\" It is all very well to talk in that way. I have got so used\nto my Journal that I can't do without it. Nevertheless, I must stop\nnow--for the best of reasons. Though I have got three lighted candles on\nmy table, I really cannot see to write any more.\n\nTo bed! to bed!\n\n[Note.--I have purposely abstained from interrupting Lucilla's Journal\nuntil my extracts from it had reached this place. Here the writer pauses,\nand gives me a chance; and here there are matters that must be mentioned,\nof which she had personally no knowledge at the time.\n\nYou have seen how her faithful instinct still tries to reveal to my poor\ndarling the cruel deception that is being practiced on her--and still\ntries in vain. In spite of herself, she shrinks from the man who is\ntempting her to go away with him--though he pleads in the character of\nher betrothed husband. In spite of herself, she detects the weak places\nin the case which Nugent has made out against me--the absence of\nsufficient motive for the conduct of which he accuses me, and the utter\nimprobability of my plotting and intriguing (without anything to gain by\nit) to make her marry the man who was not the man of her choice. She\nfeels these hesitations and difficulties. But what they really signify it\nis morally impossible for her to guess.\n\nThus far, no doubt, her strange and touching position has been plainly\nrevealed to you. But can I feel quite so sure that you understand how\nseriously she has been affected by the anxiety, disappointment, and\nsuspense which have combined together to torture her at this critical\ninterval in her life?\n\nI doubt it, for the sufficient reason that you have only had her Journal\nto enlighten you, and that her Journal shows she does not understand it\nherself. As things are, it seems to be time for me to step on the stage,\nand to discover to you plainly what her surgeon really thought of her, by\ntelling you what passed between Grosse and Nugent, when the German\npresented himself at the hotel.\n\nI am writing now (as a matter of course) from information given to me, at\nan after-period, by the persons themselves. As to particulars, the\naccounts vary. As to results, they both agree.\n\nThe discovery that Nugent was at Ramsgate necessarily took Grosse by\nsurprise. With his previous knowledge, however, of the situation of\naffairs at Dimchurch, he could be at no loss to understand in what\ncharacter Nugent had presented himself to Lucilla; and he could certainly\nnot fail to understand--after what he had seen and what she had herself\ntold him--that the deception was, under present circumstances, producing\nthe worst possible effect on her mind. Arriving at this conclusion, he\nwas not a man to hesitate about the duty that lay before him. When he\nentered the room at the hotel in which Nugent was waiting, he announced\nthe object of his visit in these four plain words, as follows:\n\n\"Pack up, and go!\"\n\nNugent coolly offered him a chair, and asked what he meant.\n\nGrosse refused the chair--but consented to explain himself in terms\nvariously reported by the two parties. Combining the statements, and\ntranslating Grosse (in this grave matter) into plain English, I find that\nthe German must have expressed himself in these, or nearly in these,\nwords:\n\n\"As a professional man, Mr. Nugent, I invariably refuse to enter into\ndomestic considerations connected with my patients with which I have\nnothing to do. In the case of Miss Finch, my business is not with your\nfamily complications. My business is to secure the recovery of the young\nlady's sight. If I find her health improving, I don't inquire how or why.\nNo matter what private and personal frauds you may be practicing upon\nher, I have nothing to say to them--more, I am ready to take advantage of\nthem myself--so long as their influence is directly beneficial in keeping\nher morally and physically in the condition in which I wish her to be.\nBut, the instant I discover that this domestic conspiracy of yours--this\npersonation of your brother which once quieted and comforted her--is\nunfavorably affecting her health of body and her peace of mind, I\ninterfere between you in the character of her medical attendant, and stop\nit on medical grounds. You are producing in my patient a conflict of\nfeeling, which--in a nervous temperament like hers--cannot go on without\nserious injury to her health. And serious injury to her health means\nserious injury to her eyes. I won't have that--I tell you plainly to pack\nup and go. I meddle with nothing else. After what you have yourself seen,\nI leave you to decide whether you will restore your brother to Miss\nFinch, or not. All I say is, Go. Make any excuse you like, but go before\nyou have done more mischief. You shake your head! Is that a sign that you\nrefuse? Take a day to think, before you make up your mind. I have\npatients in London to whom I am obliged to go back. But the day after\nto-morrow, I shall return to Ramsgate. If I find you still here, I shall\ntell Miss Finch you are no more Oscar Dubourg than I am. In her present\nstate, I see less danger in giving her even that serious shock than in\nleaving her to the slow torment of mind which you are inflicting by your\ncontinued presence in this place. My last word is said. I go back by the\nnext train, in an hour's time. Good morning, Mr. Nugent. If you are a\nwise man, you will meet me at the station.\"\n\nAfter this, the accounts vary. Nugent's statement asserts that he\naccompanied Grosse on his way back to Miss Batchford's lodging, arguing\nthe matter with him, and only leaving him at the door of the house.\nGrosse's statement, on the other hand, makes no allusion to this. The\ndisagreement between them is, however, of no consequence here. It is\nadmitted, on either side, that the result of the interview was the same.\nWhen Grosse took the train for London, Nugent Dubourg was not at the\nstation. The next entry in the Journal shows that he remained that day\nand night, at least, at Ramsgate.\n\nYou now know, from the narrative of the surgeon's own proceedings, how\nseriously he thought of his patient's case, and how firmly he did his\nduty as a professional man. Having given you this necessary information,\nI again retire, and leave Lucilla to take up the next link in the chain\nof events.--P.]\n\n_September_ 5th. _Six o'clock in the morning._--A few hours of restless,\nbroken sleep--disturbed by horrid dreams, and waking over and over again\nwith startings that seemed to shake me from head to foot. I can bear it\nno longer. The sun is rising. I have got up--and here I am at the\nwriting-table, trying to finish the long story of yesterday still\nuncompleted in my Journal.\n\nI have just been looking at the view from my window--and I notice one\nthing which has struck me. The mist this morning is the thickest mist I\nhave yet seen here.\n\nThe sea-view is almost invisible, it is so dim and dull. Even the objects\nabout me in my room are nothing like so plain as usual. The mist is\nstealing in no doubt through my open window. It gets between me and my\npaper, and obliges me to bend down close over the page to see what I am\nabout. When the sun is higher, things will be clear again. In the\nmeantime, I must do as well as I can.\n\nGrosse came back after his walk as mysterious as ever.\n\nHe was quite peremptory in ordering me not to overtask my\neyes--forbidding reading and writing, as I have already mentioned. But,\nwhen I asked for his reasons, he had, for the first time in my experience\nof him, no reasons to give. I have the less scruple about disobeying him,\non that account. Still I am a little uneasy, I confess, when I think of\nhis strange behavior yesterday. He looked at me, in the oddest way--as if\nhe saw something in my face which he had never seen before. Twice he took\nhis leave; and twice he returned, doubtful whether he would not remain at\nRamsgate, and let his patients in London take care of themselves. His\nextraordinary indecision was put an end to at last by the arrival of a\ntelegram which had followed him from London. An urgent message, I\nsuppose, from one of the patients. He went away in a bad temper and a\nviolent hurry; and told me, at the door, to expect him back on the sixth.\n\nWhen Oscar came later, there was another surprise for me.\n\nLike Grosse, he was not himself--he too behaved strangely! First, he was\nso cold and so silent, that I thought he was offended. Then he went\nstraight to the other extreme, and became so loudly talkative, so\nobstreperously cheerful, that my aunt asked me privately whether I did\nnot suspect (as she did) that he had been taking too much wine. It ended\nin his trying to sing to my accompaniment on the piano, and in his\nbreaking down. He walked away to the other end of the room without\nexplanation or apology. When I followed him there a little while after,\nhe had a look that indescribably distressed me--a look as if he had been\ncrying. Towards the end of the evening, my aunt fell asleep over her\nbook, and gave us a chance of speaking to each other in a little second\nroom which opens out of the drawing-room in this house. It was I who took\nthe chance--not he. He was so incomprehensibly unwilling to go into the\nroom and speak to me, that I had to do a very unladylike thing. I mean\nthat I had to take his arm, and lead him in myself, and entreat him (in a\nwhisper) to tell me what was the matter with him.\n\n\"Only the old complaint,\" he answered.\n\nI made him sit down by me on a little couch that just held two.\n\n\"What do you mean by the old complaint?\" I asked.\n\n\"Oh! you know!\"\n\n\"I _don't_ know.\"\n\n\"You would know if you really loved me.\"\n\n\"Oscar! it is a shame to say that. It is a shame to doubt that I love\nyou!\"\n\n\"Is it? Ever since I have been here, I have doubted that you love me. It\nis getting to be an old complaint of mine now. I still suffer a little\nsometimes. Don't notice it!\"\n\nHe was so cruel and so unjust, that I got up to leave him, without saying\na word more. But, oh! he looked so forlorn and so submissive--sitting\nwith his head down, and his hands crossed listlessly over his knees--that\nI could not find it in my heart to treat him harshly. Was I wrong? I\ndon't know! I have no idea how to manage men--and no Madame Pratolungo\nnow to teach me. Right or wrong, it ended in my sitting down by him again\nin the place which I had just left.\n\n\"You ought to beg my pardon,\" I said, \"for thinking of me as you think,\nand talking to me as you talk.\"\n\n\"I do beg your pardon,\" he answered humbly. \"I am sorry if I have\noffended you.\"\n\nHow could I resist that? I put my hand on his shoulder, and tried to make\nhim lift up his head and look at me.\n\n\"You will always believe in me in the future?\" I went on. \"Promise me\nthat.\"\n\n\"I can promise to try, Lucilla. As things are now I can promise no more.\"\n\n\"As things are now? You are speaking in riddles to-night. Explain\nyourself.\"\n\n\"I explained myself this morning on the pier.\"\n\nSurely, this was hard on me--after he had promised to give me till the\nend of the week to consider his proposal? I took my hand off his\nshoulder. He--who never used to displease or disappoint me when I was\nblind--had displeased and disappointed me for the second time in a few\nminutes!\n\n\"Do you wish to force me?\" I asked, \"after telling me this morning that\nyou would give me time to reflect?\"\n\nHe rose, on his side--languidly and mechanically, like a man who neither\nknew nor cared what he was doing.\n\n\"Force you?\" he repeated. \"Did I say that? I don't know what I am talking\nabout; I don't know what I am doing. You are right and I am wrong. I am a\nmiserable wretch, Lucilla--I am utterly unworthy of you. It would be\nbetter for you if you never saw me again!\" He paused; and taking me by\nboth hands, looked earnestly and sadly into my face. \"Good night, my\ndear!\" he said--and suddenly dropped my hands, and turned away to go out.\n\nI stopped him. \"Going already?\" I said. \"It is not late yet.\n\n\"It is best for me to go.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n\"I am in wretched spirits. It is better for me to be by myself.\"\n\n\"Don't say that! It sounds like a reproach to me.\"\n\n\"On the contrary, it is all my fault. Good night!\"\n\nI refused to say good night--I refused to let him go. His wanting to go\nwas in itself a reproach to me. He had never done it before. I asked him\nto sit down again.\n\nHe shook his head.\n\n\"For ten minutes!\"\n\nHe shook his head again.\n\n\"For five minutes!\"\n\nInstead of answering, he gently lifted a long lock of my hair, which hung\nat the side of my neck. (My head, I should add, had been dressed that\nevening on the old-fashioned plan, by my aunt's maid--to please my aunt.)\n\n\"If I stay for five minutes longer,\" he said, \"I shall ask for\nsomething.\"\n\n\"For what?\"\n\n\"You have beautiful hair, Lucilla.\"\n\n\"You can't want a lock of my hair, surely?\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I gave you a keepsake of that sort--ages ago. Have you forgotten it?\"\n\n[Note.--The keepsake had of course been given to the true Oscar, and was\nthen, as it is now, still in his possession. Notice, when he recovers\nhimself, how quickly the false Oscar infers this, and how cleverly he\nfounds his excuse upon it.--P.]\n\nHis face flushed deep; his eyes dropped before mine. I could see that he\nwas ashamed of himself--I could only conclude that he _had_ forgotten it!\nA morsel of _his_ hair was, at that moment, in a locket which I wore\nround my neck. I had more I think, to doubt him than he had to doubt me.\nI was so mortified that I stepped aside, and made way for him to go out.\n\n\"You wish to go away,\" I said; \"I won't keep you any longer.\"\n\nIt was his turn now to plead with _me._\n\n\"Suppose I have been deprived of your keepsake?\" he said. \"Suppose\nsomebody whom I would rather not mention, has taken it away from me?\"\n\nI instantly understood him. His miserable brother had taken it. My\nwork-basket was close by. I cut off a lock of my hair, and tied it at\neach end with a morsel of my favorite light-blue ribbon.\n\n\"Are we friends again, Oscar?\" was all I said as I put it into his hand.\n\nHe caught me in his arms in a kind of frenzy--holding me to him so\nviolently that he hurt me; kissing me so fiercely that he frightened me.\nBefore I had recovered breath enough to speak to him, he had released me,\nand had gone out in such headlong haste that he knocked down a little\nround table with books on it, and woke my aunt.\n\nThe old lady called for me in her most formidable voice, and showed me\nthe family temper in its sourest aspect. Grosse had gone back to London\nwithout making any apology to her; and Oscar had knocked down her books.\nThe indignation aroused by these two outrages called loudly for a\nvictim--and (no one else being near at the moment) selected Me. Miss\nBatchford discovered for the first time that she had undertaken too much\nin assuming the sole charge of her niece at Ramsgate.\n\n\"I decline to accept the entire responsibility,\" said my aunt. \"At my\nage, the entire responsibility is too much for me. I shall write to your\nfather, Lucilla. I always did, and always shall, detest him, as you know.\nHis views on politics and religion are (in a clergyman) simply\ndetestable. Still he is your father; and it is a duty on my part, after\nwhat that rude foreigner has said about your health, to offer to restore\nyou to your father's roof--or, at least, to obtain your father's sanction\nto your continuing to remain under my care. This course, in either case\nyou will observe, relieves me from the entire responsibility. I am doing\nnothing to compromise my position. My position is quite plain to me. I\nshould have formally accepted your father's hospitality on the occasion\nof your wedding--if I had been well enough and if the wedding had taken\nplace. It follows as a matter of course that I may formally report to\nyour father what the medical opinion is of your health. However brutally\nit may have been given, it is a medical opinion--and as such I am bound\nto communicate it.\"\n\nKnowing but too well how bitterly my aunt's aversion to him is\nreciprocated by my father, I did my best to combat Miss Batchford's\nresolution--without making matters worse by telling her what my motives\nreally were. With some difficulty I prevailed on her to defer the\nproposed report of me for a day or two--and we parted for the night (the\nold lady's fits of temper are soon over) as good friends as usual.\n\nThis little episode in my narrative of events diverted my mind for the\ntime from Oscar's strange conduct yesterday evening. But once up here by\nmyself in my own room, I have been thinking of it, or dreaming of it\n(such horrid dreams--I cannot write them down!) almost incessantly from\nthat time to this. When we meet again to-day--how will he look? what will\nhe say?\n\nHe was right yesterday. I _am_ cold to him; there is some change in me\ntowards him, which I don't understand myself. My conscience accuses me,\nnow I am alone--and yet, God knows, it is not my fault. Poor Oscar! Poor\nme! I have never longed to see him--since we met at this place--as I long\nnow. He sometimes comes to breakfast. Will he come to breakfast to-day?\nOh, how my eyes ache! and how obstinately the mist stops in the room!\nSuppose I close the window, and go back to bed again for a little while?\n\n_Nine o'clock._--The maid came in half an hour since, and woke me. She\nwent to open the window as usual. I stopped her.\n\n\"Is the mist gone?\" I asked.\n\nThe girl stared, \"What mist, Miss?\"\n\n\"Haven't you seen it?\"\n\n\"No, Miss.\"\n\n\"What time did you get up?\"\n\n\"At seven, Miss.\"\n\nAt seven I was still writing in my Journal, and the mist was still over\neverything in the room. Persons in the lower ranks of life are curiously\nunobservant of the aspects of Nature. I never (in the days of my\nblindness) got any information from servants or laborers about the views\nround Dimchurch. They seemed to have no eyes for anything beyond the\nrange of the kitchen, or the ploughed field. I got out of bed, and took\nthe maid myself to the window, and opened it.\n\n\"There!\" I said. \"It is not quite so thick as it was some hours since.\nBut there is the mist as plain as can be!\"\n\nThe girl looked backwards and forwards in a state of bewilderment between\nme and the view.\n\n\"Mist?\" she repeated. \"Begging your pardon, Miss, it's a beautiful clear\nmorning--as I see it.\"\n\n\"Clear?\" I repeated on my side.\n\n\"Yes, Miss!\"\n\n\"Do you mean to tell me it's clear over the sea?\"\n\n\"The sea is a beautiful blue, Miss. Far and near, you can see the ships.\"\n\n\"Where are the ships?\"\n\nShe pointed, out of the window, to a certain spot.\n\n\"There are two of them, Miss. A big ship, with three masts. And a little\nship just behind, with one.\"\n\nI looked along her finger, and strained my eyes to see. All I could make\nout was a dim greyish mist, with something like a little spot or blur on\nit, at the place which the maid's finger indicated as the position\noccupied by the two ships.\n\nThe idea struck me for the first time that the dimness which I had\nattributed to the mist, was, in plain truth, the dimness in my own eyes.\nFor the moment I was a little startled. I left the window, and made the\nbest excuse that I could to the girl. As soon as it was possible to\ndismiss her, I sent her away, and bathed my eyes with one of Grosse's\nlotions, and then tried them again in writing this entry. To my relief, I\ncan see to write better than I did earlier in the morning. Still, I have\nhad a warning to pay a little more attention to Grosse's directions than\nI have hitherto done. Is it possible that he saw something in the state\nof my eyes which he was afraid to tell me of? Nonsense! Grosse is not the\nsort of man who shrinks from speaking out. I have fatigued my eyes--that\nis all. Let me shut up my book, and go down-stairs to breakfast.\n\n_Ten o'clock._--For a moment, I open my Journal again.\n\nSomething has happened which I must positively set down in the history of\nmy life. I am so vexed and so angry! The maid, (wretched chattering\nfool!) has told my aunt what passed between us this morning at my window.\nMiss Batchford has taken the alarm, and has insisted on writing, not only\nto Grosse, but to my father. In the present embittered state of my\nfather's feelings against my aunt, he will either leave her letter\nunanswered, or he will offend her by an angry reply. In either case, I\nshall be the sufferer: my aunt's sense of injury--which cannot address\nitself to my father--will find a convenient object to assail in me. I\nshall never hear the last of it. Being already nervous and dispirited,\nthe prospect of finding myself involved in a new family quarrel quite\ndaunts me. I feel ungratefully inclined to run away from Miss Batchford,\nwhen I think of it!\n\nNo signs of Oscar; and no news of Oscar--yet.\n\n_Twelve o'clock._--But one trial more was wanted to make my life here\nquite unendurable. The trial has come.\n\nA letter from Oscar (sent by a messenger from his hotel) has just been\nplaced in my hands. It informs me that he has decided on leaving Ramsgate\nby the next train. The next train starts in forty minutes. Good God! what\nam I to do?\n\nMy eyes are burning. I know it does them harm to cry. How can I help\ncrying? It is all over between us, if I let Oscar go away alone--his\nletter as good as tells me so. Oh, why have I behaved so coldly to him? I\nought to make any sacrifice of my own feelings to atone for it. And yet,\nthere is an obstinate something in me that shrinks--What am I to do? what\nam I to do?\n\nI must drop the pen, and try if I can think. My eyes completely fail me.\nI can write no more.\n\n[Note.--I copy the letter to which Lucilla refers.\n\nNugent's own assertion is, that he wrote it in a moment of remorse, to\ngive her an opportunity of breaking the engagement by which she\ninnocently supposed herself to be held to him. He declares that he\nhonestly believed the letter would offend her, when he wrote it. The\nother interpretation of the document is, that finding himself obliged to\nleave Ramsgate--under penalty (if he remained) of being exposed by Grosse\nas an impostor, when the surgeon visited his patient on the next\nday--Nugent seized the opportunity of making his absence the means of\nworking on Lucilla's feelings, so as to persuade her to accompany him to\nLondon. Don't ask me which of these two conclusions I favor. For reasons\nwhich you will understand when you have come to the end of my narrative,\nI would rather not express my opinion, either one way or the other.\n\nRead the letter--and determine for yourselves:\n\n\"MY DARLING,--After a sleepless night, I have decided on leaving\nRamsgate, by the next train that starts after you receive these lines.\nLast night's experience has satisfied me that my presence here (after\nwhat I said to you on the pier) only distresses you. Some influence that\nis too strong for you to resist has changed your heart towards me. When\nthe time comes for you to determine whether you will be my wife on the\nconditions that I have proposed, I see but too plainly that you will say\nNo. Let me make it less hard for you, my love, to do that, by leaving you\nto write the word--instead of saying it to me. If you wish for your\nfreedom, cost me what it may, I will absolve you from your engagement. I\nlove you too dearly to blame you. My address in London is on the other\nleaf. Farewell!\n\n\"OSCAR.\"\n\nThe address given on the blank leaf is at an hotel.\n\nA few lines more in the Journal follow the lines last quoted in this\nplace. Except a word or two, here and there, it is impossible any longer\nto decipher the writing. The mischief done to her eyes by her reckless\nuse of them, by her fits of crying, by her disturbed nights, by the\nlong-continued strain on her of agitation and suspense, has evidently\njustified the worst of those unacknowledged forebodings which Grosse felt\nwhen he saw her. The last lines of the Journal are, as writing, actually\ninferior to her worst penmanship when she was blind.\n\nHowever, the course which she ended in taking on receipt of the letter\nwhich you have just read, is sufficiently indicated by a note of Nugent's\nwriting, left at Miss Batchford's residence at Ramsgate by a porter from\nthe railway. After-events make it necessary to preserve this note also.\nIt runs thus:--\n\n\"MADAM,--I write, by Lucilla's wish, to beg that you will not be anxious\non discovering that your niece has left Ramsgate. She accompanies me, at\nmy express request, to the house of a married lady who is a relative of\nmine, and under whose care she will remain, until the time arrives for\nour marriage. The reasons which have led to her taking this step, and\nwhich oblige her to keep her new place of residence concealed for the\npresent, will be frankly stated to you and to her father on the day when\nwe are man and wife. In the meantime, Lucilla begs that you will excuse\nher abrupt departure, and that you will be so good as to send this letter\non to her father. Both you and he will, I hope, remember that she is of\nan age to act for herself, and that she is only hastening her marriage\nwith a man to whom she has been long engaged, with the sanction and\napproval of her family--Believe me, Madam, your faithful Servant,\n\n\"OSCAR DUBOURG.\"\n\nThis letter was delivered at luncheon-time--almost at the moment when the\nservant had announced to her mistress that Miss Finch was nowhere to be\nfound, and that her traveling-bag had disappeared from her room. The\nLondon train had then started. Miss Batchford, having no right to\ninterfere, decided--after consultation with a friend--on at once\ntraveling to Dimchurch, and placing the matter in Mr. Finch's hands.--P.]\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-SIXTH\n\nThe Italian Steamer\n\nLUCILLA'S Journal has told you all that Lucilla can tell. Permit me to\nreappear in these pages. Shall I say, with your favorite English clown,\nreappearing every year in your barbarous English pantomime, \"Here I am\nagain: how do you do?\" No--I had better leave that out. Your clown is one\nof your national institutions. With this mysterious source of British\namusement let no foreign person presume to trifle.\n\nI arrived at Marseilles, as well as I can remember, on the fifteenth of\nAugust.\n\nYou cannot be expected to feel any interest in good Papa. I will pass\nover this venerable victim of the amiable delusions of the heart, as\nrapidly as respect and affection will permit. The duel (I hope you\nremember the duel?) had been fought with pistols; and the bullet had not\nbeen extracted when I joined my sisters at the sufferer's bedside. He was\ndelirious and did not know me. Two days later, the removal of the bullet\nwas accomplished by the surgeon in attendance. For a time, he improved\nafter this. Then there was a relapse. It was only on the first of\nSeptember that we were permitted to hope he might still be spared to us.\n\nOn that date, I was composed enough to think again of Lucilla, and to\nremember Mrs. Finch's polite request to me that I would write to her from\nMarseilles.\n\nI wrote briefly, telling the damp lady of the rectory (only at greater\nlength) what I have told here. My main motive in doing this was, I\nconfess, to obtain, through Mrs. Finch, some news of Lucilla. After\nposting the letter, I attended to another duty which I had neglected\nwhile my father was in danger of death. I went to the person to whom my\nlawyer had recommended me, to institute that search for Oscar which I had\ndetermined to set on foot when I left London. The person was connected\nwith the police, in the capacity (as nearly as I can express it in\nEnglish) of a sort of private superintendent--not officially recognized,\nbut secretly trusted for all that.\n\nWhen he heard of the time that had elapsed without any discovery of the\nslightest trace of the fugitive, he looked grave; and declared, honestly\nenough, that he doubted if he could reward my confidence in him by\nproving himself to be of the slightest service to me. Seeing, however,\nthat I was earnestly bent on making some sort of effort, he put a last\nquestion to me in these terms:--\"You have not described the gentleman\nyet. Is there, by lucky chance, anything remarkable in his personal\nappearance?\"\n\n\"There is something very remarkable, sir,\" I answered. \"Describe it\nexactly, ma'am, if you please.\"\n\nI described Oscar's complexion. My excellent superintendent showed\nencouraging signs of interest as he listened. He was a most\nelegantly-dressed gentleman, with the gracious manners of a prince. It\nwas quite a privilege to be allowed to talk to him.\n\n\"If the missing man has passed through France,\" he said, \"with such a\nremarkable face as that, there is a fair chance of finding him. I will\nset preliminary inquiries going at the railway station, at the\nsteam-packet office, and at the port. You shall hear the result\nto-morrow.\"\n\nI went back to good Papa's bedside--satisfied, so far.\n\nThe next day, my superintendent honored me by a visit.\n\n\"Any news, sir?\" I asked.\n\n\"News already, ma'am. The clerk at the steam-packet office perfectly well\nremembers selling a ticket to a stranger with a terrible blue face.\nUnhappily, his memory is not equally good, as to other matters. He cannot\naccurately call to mind, either the name of the stranger, or the place\nfor which the stranger embarked. We know that he must either have gone to\nsome port in Italy, or to some port in the East. And, thus far, we know\nno more.\n\n\"What are we to do next?\" I inquired.\n\n\"I propose--with your permission--sending personal descriptions of the\ngentleman, by telegraph, to the different ports in Italy first. If\nnothing is heard of him in reply, we will try the ports in the East next.\nThat is the course which I have the honor of submitting to your\nconsideration. Do you approve of it?\"\n\nI cordially approved of it; and waited for the results with all the\npatience that I could command.\n\nThe next day passed, and nothing happened. My unhappy father got on very\nslowly. The vile woman who had caused the disaster (and who had run off\nwith his antagonist) was perpetually in his mind; disturbing him and\nkeeping him back. Why is a destroying wretch of this sort, a pitiless,\ntreacherous, devouring monster in female form, allowed to be out of\nprison? You shut up in a cage a poor tigress, who only eats you when she\nis hungry, and can't provide for her dear little children in any other\nway--and you let the other and far more dangerous beast of the two range\nat large under protection of the law! Ah, it is easy to see that the men\nmake the laws. Never mind. The women are coming to the front. Wait a\nlittle. The tigresses on two legs will have a bad time of it when we get\ninto Parliament.\n\nOn the fourth of the month, the superintendent wrote to me. More news of\nthe lost Oscar already!\n\nThe blue man had disembarked at Genoa; and had been traced to the station\nof the railway running to Turin. More inquiries had been, thereupon, sent\nby telegraph to Turin. In the meantime, and in the possible event of the\nmissing person returning to England by way of Marseilles, experienced\nmen, provided with a personal description of him, would be posted at\nvarious public places, to pass in review all travelers arriving either by\nland or sea--and to report to me if the right traveler appeared. Once\nmore, my princely superintendent submitted this course to my\nconsideration--and waited for my approval--and got it, with my admiration\nthrown in as part of the bargain.\n\nThe days passed--and good Papa still vacillated between better and worse.\n\nMy sisters broke down, poor souls, under their anxieties. It all fell as\nusual on my shoulders. Day by day, my prospect of returning to England\nseemed to grow more and more remote. Not a line of reply reached me from\nMrs. Finch. This in itself fidgeted and disturbed me. Lucilla was now\nhardly ever out of my thoughts. Over and over again, my anxiety urged me\nto run the risk, and write to her. But the same obstacle always raised\nitself in my way. After what had happened between us, it was impossible\nfor me to write to her directly, without first restoring myself to my\nformer place in her estimation. And I could only do this, by entering\ninto particulars which, for all I knew to the contrary, it might still be\ncruel and dangerous to reveal.\n\nAs for writing to Miss Batchford, I had already tried the old lady's\npatience in that way, before leaving England. If I tried it again, with\nno better excuse for a second intrusion than my own anxieties might\nsuggest, the chances were that this uncompromising royalist would throw\nmy letter in the fire, and treat her republican correspondent with\ncontemptuous silence. Grosse was the third, and last, person from whom I\nmight hope to obtain information. But--shall I confess it?--I did not\nknow what Lucilla might have told him of the estrangement between us, and\nmy pride (remember, if you please, that I am a poverty-stricken\nforeigner) revolted at the idea of exposing myself to a possible repulse.\n\nHowever, by the eleventh of the month, I began to feel my suspense so\nkeenly, and to suffer under such painful doubts of what Nugent might be\ndoing in my absence, that I resolved at all hazards on writing to Grosse.\nIt was at least possible, as I calculated--and the Journal will show you\nI calculated right--that Lucilla had only told him of my melancholy\nerrand at Marseilles, and had mentioned nothing more. I had just opened\nmy desk--when our doctor in attendance entered the room, and announced\nthe joyful intelligence that he could answer at last for the recovery of\ngood Papa.\n\n\"Can I go back to England?\" I asked eagerly.\n\n\"Not immediately. You are his favorite nurse--you must gradually accustom\nhim to the idea of your going away. If you do anything sudden you may\ncause a relapse.\"\n\n\"I will do nothing sudden. Only tell me, when it will be safe--absolutely\nsafe--for me to go?\"\n\n\"Say, in a week.\"\n\n\"On the eighteenth?\"\n\n\"On the eighteenth.\"\n\nI shut up my writing-desk. Within a few days, I might now hope to be in\nEngland as soon as I could receive Grosse's answer at Marseilles. Under\nthese circumstances, it would be better to wait until I could make my\ninquiries, safely and independently, in my own proper person. Comparison\nof dates will show that if I _had_ written to the German oculist, it\nwould have been too late. It was now the eleventh; and Lucilla had left\nRamsgate with Nugent on the fifth.\n\nAll this time but one small morsel of news rewarded our inquiries after\nOscar--and even that small morsel seemed to me to be unworthy of belief.\n\nIt was said that he had been seen at a military hospital--the hospital of\nAlessandria, in Piedmont, I think--acting, under the surgeons, as\nattendant on the badly-wounded men who had survived the famous campaign\nof France and Italy against Austria. (Bear in mind, if you please, that I\nam writing of the year eighteen hundred and fifty-nine, and that the\npeace of Villafranca was only signed in the July of that year.)\nOccupation as hospital-man-nurse was, to my mind, occupation so utterly\nat variance with Oscar's temperament and character, that I persisted in\nconsidering the intelligence thus received of him to be on the face of it\nfalse.\n\nOn the seventeenth of the month, I had got my passport regulated, and had\npacked up the greater part of my baggage in anticipation of my journey\nback to England on the next day.\n\nCarefully as I had tried to accustom his mind to the idea, my poor father\nremained so immovably reluctant to let me leave him, that I was obliged\nto consent to a sort of compromise. I promised, when the business which\ntook me to England was settled, to return again to Marseilles, and to\ntravel back with him to his home in Paris, as soon as he was fit to be\nmoved. On this condition, I gained permission to go. Poor as I was, I\ninfinitely preferred charging my slender purse with the expense of the\ndouble journey, to remaining any longer in ignorance of what was going on\nat Ramsgate--or at Dimchurch, as the case might be. Now that my mind was\nfree from anxiety about my father, I don't know which tormented me\nmost--my eagerness to set myself right with my sister-friend, or my vague\ndread of the mischief which Nugent might have done while my back was\nturned. Over, and over again I asked myself, whether Miss Batchford had,\nor had not, shown my letter to Lucilla. Over and over again, I wondered\nwhether it had been my happy privilege to reveal Nugent under his true\naspect, and to preserve Lucilla for Oscar after all.\n\nTowards the afternoon, on the seventeenth, I went out alone to get a\nbreath of fresh air, and a look at the shop-windows. I don't care who or\nwhat she may be--high or low; handsome or ugly; young or old--it always\nrelieves a woman's mind to look at the shop-windows.\n\nI had not been five minutes out, before I met my princely superintendent.\n\n\"Any news for me to-day?\" I asked.\n\n\"Not yet.\"\n\n\"Not yet?\" I repeated. \"You expect news then?\"\n\n\"We expect an Italian steam-ship to arrive in port before the evening,\"\nsaid the superintendent. \"Who knows what may happen?\"\n\nHe bowed and left me. I felt no great elation on contemplating the barren\nprospect which his last words had placed before me. So many steamers had\narrived at Marseilles, without bringing any news of the missing man, that\nI attached very little importance to the arrival of the Italian ship.\nHowever, I had nothing to do--I wanted a walk--and I thought I might as\nwell stroll down to the port, and see the vessel come in.\n\nThe vessel was just entering the harbor by the time I got to the\nlanding-stage.\n\nI found our man employed to investigate travelers arriving by sea,\npunctually at his post. His influence broke through the vexatious French\nrules and regulations which forbid all freedom of public movement within\nofficial limits, and procured me a place in the room at the custom-house\nthrough which the passengers by the steamer would be obliged to pass. I\naccepted his polite attention, simply because I was glad to sit down and\nrest in a quiet place after my walk--not even the shadow of an idea that\nanything would come of my visit to the harbor being in my mind at the\ntime.\n\nAfter a long interval the passengers began to stream into the room.\nLooking languidly enough at the first half-dozen strangers who came in, I\nfelt myself touched on the shoulder from behind. There was our man, in a\nstate of indescribable excitement, entreating me to compose myself!\n\nBeing perfectly composed already, I stared at him, and asked, \"Why?\"\n\n\"He is here!\" cried the man. \"Look!\"\n\nHe pointed to the passengers still crowding into the room. I looked; and,\ninstantly losing my head, started up with a cry that turned everybody's\neyes on me. Yes! there was the poor dear discolored face--there was Oscar\nhimself, thunderstruck on his side at the sight of Me!\n\nI snatched the key of his portmanteau out of his hand, and gave it to our\nman--who undertook to submit it to the customhouse examination, and to\nbring it to my lodging afterwards. Holding Oscar fast by the arm, I\npushed my way through the crowd in the room, got outside, and hailed a\ncab at the dock gates. The people about, noticing my agitation, said to\neach other compassionately, \"It's the blue man's mother!\" Idiots! They\nmight have seen, I think, that I was only old enough to be his elder\nsister.\n\nOnce sheltered in the vehicle, I could draw my breath again, and reward\nhim for all the anxiety he had caused me by giving him a kiss. I might\nhave given him a thousand kisses. Amazement made him a perfectly passive\ncreature in my hands. He only repeated faintly, over and over again,\n\"What does it mean? what does it mean?\"\n\n\"It means that you have friends, you wretch, who are fools enough to be\ntoo fond of you to give you up!\" I said. \"I am one of the fools. You will\ncome to England with me to-morrow--and see for yourself if Lucilla is not\nanother.\"\n\nThat reference to Lucilla restored him to the possession of his senses.\nHe began to ask the questions that naturally occurred to him under the\ncircumstances. Having plenty of questions in reserve, on my side, I told\nhim briefly enough what had brought me to Marseilles, and what I had\ndone, during my residence in that city, towards discovering the place of\nhis retreat.\n\nWhen he asked me next--after a momentary struggle with himself--what I\ncould tell him of Nugent and Lucilla, it is not to be denied that I\nhesitated before I answered him. A moment's consideration, however, was\nenough to decide me on speaking out--for this plain reason, that a\nmoment's consideration reminded me of the troubles and annoyances which\nhad already befallen us as the result of concealing the truth. I told\nOscar honestly all that I have related here--starting from my night\ninterview with Nugent at Browndown, and ending with my precautionary\nmeasures for the protection of Lucilla while she was living under the\ncare of her aunt.\n\nI was greatly interested in watching the effect which these disclosures\nproduced on Oscar.\n\nMy observation led me to form two conclusions. First conclusion, that\ntime and absence had not produced the slightest change in the love which\nthe poor fellow bore to Lucilla. Second conclusion, that nothing but\nabsolute proof would induce him to agree in my unfavorable opinion of his\nbrother's character. It was in vain I declared that Nugent had quitted\nEngland pledged to find him, and had left it to me (as the event now\nproved) to make the discovery. He owned readily that he had seen nothing,\nand heard nothing, of Nugent. Nevertheless his confidence in his brother\nremained unshaken. \"Nugent is the soul of honor,\" he repeated again and\nagain--with a side-look at me which suggested that my frankly-avowed\nopinion of his brother had hurt and offended him.\n\nI had barely time to notice this, before we reached my lodgings. He\nappeared to be unwilling to follow me into the house.\n\n\"I suppose you have some proof to support what you have said of Nugent,\"\nhe resumed, stopping in the courtyard. \"Have you written to England since\nyou have been here? and have you had a reply?\"\n\n\"I have written to Mrs. Finch,\" I answered; \"and I have not had a word in\nreply.\"\n\n\"Have you written to no one else?\"\n\nI explained to him the position in which I stood towards Miss Batchford,\nand the hesitation which I had felt about writing to Grosse. The\nsmoldering resentment against me that had been in him ever since I had\nspoken of his brother and of Lucilla, flamed up at last.\n\n\"I entirely disagree with you,\" he broke out angrily. \"You are wronging\nLucilla and wronging Nugent. Lucilla is incapable of saying anything\nagainst you to Grosse; and Nugent is equally incapable of misleading her\nas you suppose. What horrible ingratitude you attribute to one of\nthem--and what horrible baseness to the other! I have listened to you as\npatiently as I can; and I feel sincerely obliged by the interest which\nyou have shown in me--but I cannot remain in your company any longer.\nMadame Pratolungo, your suspicions are inhuman! You have not brought\nforward a shadow of proof in support of them. I will send here for my\nluggage, if you will allow me--and I will start for England by the next\ntrain. After what you have said, I can't rest till I have found out the\ntruth for myself.\"\n\nThis was my reward for all the trouble that I had taken to discover Oscar\nDubourg! Never mind the money I had spent--I am not rich enough to care\nabout money--only consider the trouble. If I had been a man, I do really\nthink I should have knocked him down. Being only a woman, I dropped him a\nlow curtsey, and stung him with my tongue.\n\n\"As you please, sir,\" I said. \"I have done my best to serve you--and you\nquarrel with me and leave me, in return. Go! You are not the first fool\nwho has quarreled with his best friend.\"\n\nEither the words or the curtsey--or both together--brought him to his\nsenses. He made me an apology--which I received. And he looked\nexcessively foolish--which put me in an excellent humour again. \"You\nstupid boy,\" I said, taking his arm, and leading him to the stairs. \"When\nwe first met at Dimchurch did you find me a suspicious woman or an\ninhuman woman? Answer me that!\"\n\nHe answered frankly enough.\n\n\"I found you all that was kind and good. Still, it is surely only natural\nto want _some_ confirmation----\" He checked himself there, and reverted\nabruptly to my letter to Mrs. Finch. The silence of the rector's wife\nevidently alarmed him. \"How long is it since you wrote?\" he inquired.\n\n\"As long ago as the first of this month,\" I replied.\n\nHe fell into thought. We ascended the next flight of stairs in silence.\nAt the landing, he stopped me, and spoke again. My unanswered letter was\nstill uppermost in his mind.\n\n\"Mrs. Finch loses everything that _can_ be lost,\" he said. \"Is it not\nlikely--with her habits--that when she had written her answer, and wanted\nyour letter to look at to put the address on it, your letter was like her\nhandkerchief or her novel, or anything else--not to be found?\"\n\nSo far, no doubt, this was quite in Mrs. Finch's character. I could see\nthat--but my mind was too much pre-occupied to draw the inference that\nfollowed. Oscar's next words enlightened me.\n\n\"Have you tried the Poste-Restante?\" he asked.\n\nWhat could I possibly have been thinking of! Of course, she had lost my\nletter. Of course, the whole house would be upset in looking for it, and\nthe rector would silence the uproar by ordering his wife to try the\nPoste-Restante. How strangely we had changed places! Instead of my clear\nhead thinking for Oscar, here was Oscar's clear head thinking for Me. Is\nmy stupidity quite incredible? Remember, if you please, what a weight of\ntrouble and anxiety had lain on my mind while I was at Marseilles. Can\none think of everything while one is afflicted, as I was? Not even such a\nclever person as You can do that. If, as the saying is, \"Homer sometimes\nnods\"--why not Madame Pratolungo?\n\n\"I never thought of the Poste-Restante,\" I said to Oscar. \"If you don't\nmind going back a little way, shall we inquire at once?\"\n\nHe was perfectly willing. We went downstairs again, and out into the\nstreet. On our way to the post-office, I seized my first opportunity of\nmaking Oscar give me some account of himself.\n\n\"I have satisfied your curiosity, to the best of my ability,\" I said, as\nwe walked arm-in-arm through the streets. \"Now suppose you satisfy mine.\nA report of your having been seen in a military hospital in Italy, is the\nonly report of you which has reached me here. Of course, it is not true?\"\n\n\"It is perfectly true.\"\n\n\"You, in a hospital, nursing wounded soldiers?\"\n\n\"That is exactly what I have been doing.\"\n\nNo words could express my astonishment. I could only stop, and look at\nhim.\n\n\"Was that the occupation which you had in view when you left England?\" I\nasked.\n\n\"I had no object in leaving England,\" he answered, \"but the object which\nI avowed to you. After what had happened, I owed it to Lucilla and I owed\nit to Nugent to go. I left England without caring where I went. The train\nto Lyons happened to be the first train that started on my arrival at\nParis. I took the first train. At Lyons, I saw by chance an account in a\nFrench newspaper of the sufferings of some of the badly-wounded men, left\nstill uncured after the battle of Solferino. I felt an impulse, in my own\nwretchedness, to help these other sufferers in _their_ misery. On every\nother side of it, my life was wasted. The one worthy use to which I could\nput it was to employ myself in doing good; and here was good to be done,\nI managed to get the necessary letters of introduction at Turin. With the\nhelp of these, I made myself of some use (under the regular surgeons and\ndressers) in nursing the poor mutilated, crippled men; and I have helped\na little afterwards, from my own resources, in starting them comfortably\nin new ways of life.\"\n\nIn those manly and simple words, he told me his story.\n\nOnce more I felt, what I had felt already, that there were hidden\nreserves of strength in the character of this innocent young fellow,\nwhich had utterly escaped my superficial observation of him. In choosing\nhis vocation, he was, no doubt, only following the conventional modern\ncourse in such cases. Despair has its fashions, as well as dress. Ancient\ndespair (especially of Oscar's sort) used to turn soldier, or go into a\nmonastery. Modern despair turns nurse; binds up wounds, gives physic, and\ngets cured or not in that useful but nasty way. Oscar had certainly\nstruck out nothing new for himself: he had only followed the fashion.\nStill, it implied, as I thought, both courage and resolution to have\nconquered the obstacles which he must have overcome, and to have held\nsteadily on his course after he had once entered it. Having begun by\nquarreling with him, I was in a fair way to end by respecting him. Surely\nthis man was worth preserving for Lucilla, after all!\n\n\"May I ask where you were going, when we met at the port?\" I continued.\n\"Have you left Italy because there were no more wounded soldiers to be\ncured?\"\n\n\"There was no more work for me at the hospital to which I was attached,\"\nhe said. \"And there were certain obstacles in my way, as a stranger and a\nProtestant, among the poor and afflicted population outside the hospital.\nI might have overcome those obstacles, with little trouble, among a\npeople so essentially good-tempered and courteous as the Italians, if I\nhad tried. But it occurred to me that my first duty was to my own\ncountrymen. The misery crying for relief in London, is misery not\nparalleled in any city of Italy. When you met me, I was on my way to\nLondon, to place my services at the disposal of any clergyman, in a poor\nneighborhood, who would accept such help as I can offer him.\" He paused a\nlittle--hesitated--and added in lower tones:--\"That was one of my objects\nin returning to England. It is only honest to own to you that I had\nanother motive besides.\"\n\n\"A motive connected with your brother and with Lucilla?\" I suggested.\n\n\"Yes. Don't misinterpret me! I am not returning to England to retract\nwhat I said to Nugent. I still leave him free to plead his own cause with\nLucilla in his own person. I am still resolved not to distress myself and\ndistress them, by returning to Dimchurch. But I have a longing that\nnothing can subdue, to know how it has ended between them. Don't ask me\nto say more than that! In spite of the time that has passed, it breaks my\nheart to talk of Lucilla. I had looked forward to a meeting with you in\nLondon, and to hearing what I longed to hear, from your lips. Judge for\nyourself what my hopes were when I first saw your face; and forgive me if\nI felt my disappointment bitterly, when I found that you had really no\nnews to tell, and when you spoke of Nugent as you did.\" He stopped, and\npressed my arm earnestly. \"Suppose I am right about Mrs. Finch's letter?\"\nhe added. \"Suppose it should really be waiting for you at the post?\"\n\n\"Well?\"\n\n\"The letter may contain the news which I most want to hear.\"\n\nI checked him there. \"I am not sure of that,\" I answered. \"I don't know\nwhat it is that you most want to hear.\"\n\nI said those words with a purpose. What was the news he was longing for?\nIn spite of all that he had told me, my instincts answered: News that\nLucilla is still a single woman. My object in speaking as I had just\nspoken, was to tempt him into a reply which might confirm me in this\nopinion. He evaded the reply. Was that confirmation in itself? Yes--as\n_I_ think!\n\n\"Will you tell me what there is in the letter?\" he asked--passing, as you\nsee, entirely over what I had just said to him.\n\n\"Yes--if you wish it,\" I answered: not over well pleased with his want of\nconfidence in me.\n\n\"No matter what the letter contains?\" he went on, evidently doubting me.\n\nI said Yes, again--that one word, and no more.\n\n\"I suppose it would be asking too much,\" he persisted, \"to ask you to let\nme read the letter myself?\"\n\nMy temper, as you are well aware by this time, is not the temper of a\nsaint. I drew my arm smartly out of his arm; and I surveyed him with,\nwhat poor Pratolungo used to call, \"my Roman look.\"\n\n\"Mr. Oscar Dubourg! say, in plain words, that you distrust me.\"\n\nHe protested of course that he did nothing of the kind--without producing\nthe slightest effect on me. Just run over in your mind the insults,\nworries, and anxieties which had assailed me, as the reward for my\nfriendly interest in this man's welfare. Or, if that is too great an\neffort, be so good as to remember that Lucilla's farewell letter to me at\nDimchurch, was now followed by the equally ungracious expression of\nOscar's distrust--and this at a time when I had had serious trials of my\nown to sustain at my father's bedside. I think you will admit that a\nsweeter temper than mine might have not unnaturally turned a little sour\nunder present circumstances.\n\nI answered not a word to Oscar's protestations--I only searched\nvehemently in the pocket of my dress.\n\n\"Here,\" I said, opening my card-case, \"is my address in this place; and\nhere,\" I went on, producing the document, \"is my passport, if they want\nit.\"\n\nI forced the card and the passport into his hands. He took them in\nhelpless astonishment.\n\n\"What am I to do with these?\" he asked.\n\n\"Take them to the Poste-Restante. If there is a letter for me with the\nDimchurch post-mark, I authorize you to open it. Read it before it comes\ninto my hands--and then perhaps you will be satisfied?\"\n\nHe declared that he would do nothing of the sort--and tried to force my\ndocuments back into my own possession.\n\n\"Please yourself,\" I said. \"I have done with you and your affairs. Mrs.\nFinch's letter is of no earthly consequence to me. If it _is_ at the\nPoste-Restante, I shall not trouble myself to ask for it. What concern\nhave I with news about Lucilla? What does it matter to _me_ whether she\nis married or not? I am going back to my father and my sisters. Decide\nfor yourself whether you want Mrs. Finch's letter or not.\"\n\nThat settled it. He went his way with my documents to the post-office;\nand I went mine back to the lodging.\n\nArrived in my room, I still held to the resolution which I had expressed\nto Oscar in the street. Why should I leave my poor old father to go back\nto England, and mix myself up in Lucilla's affairs? After the manner in\nwhich she had taken her leave of me, had I any reasonable prospect of\nbeing civilly received? Oscar was on his way to England--let Oscar manage\nhis own affairs; let them all three (Oscar, Nugent, Lucilla) fight it out\ntogether among themselves. What had I, Pratolungo's widow, to do with\nthis trumpery family entanglement? Nothing! It was a warm day for the\ntime of year--Pratolungo's widow, like a wise woman, determined to make\nherself comfortable. She unlocked her packed box; she removed her\ntraveling costume, and put on her dressing-gown; she took a turn in the\nroom--and, if you had come across her at that moment, I wouldn't have\nstood in your shoes for something, I can tell you!\n\n(What do you think of my consistency by this time? How often have I\nchanged my mind about Lucilla and Oscar? Reckon it up, from the time when\nI left Dimchurch. What a picture of perpetual self-contradiction I\npresent--and how improbable it is that I should act in this illogical\nway! _You_ never alter your mind under the influence of your temper or\nyour circumstances. No: you are, what they call, a consistent character.\nAnd I? Oh, I am only a human being--and I feel painfully conscious that I\nhave no business to be in a book.)\n\nIn about half an hour's time, the servant appeared with a little paper\nparcel for me. It had been left by a stranger with an English accent and\na terrible face. He had announced his intention of calling a little\nlater. The servant, a bouncing fat wench, trembled as she repeated the\nmessage, and asked if there was anything amiss between me and the man\nwith the terrible face.\n\nI opened the parcel. It contained my passport, and, sure enough, the\nletter from Mrs. Finch. Had he opened it? Yes! He had not been able to\nresist the temptation to read it. And more, he had written a line or two\non it in pencil, thus:--\"As soon as I am fit to see you, I will implore\nyour pardon. I dare not trust myself in your presence yet. Read the\nletter, and you will understand why.\"\n\nI opened the letter.\n\nIt was dated the fifth of September. I ran over the first few sentences\ncarelessly enough. Thanks for my letter--congratulations on my father's\nprospect of recovery--information about baby's gums and the rector's last\nsermon--more information about somebody else, which Mrs. Finch felt quite\nsure would interest and delight me. What!!! \"Mr. Oscar Dubourg has come\nback, and is now with Lucilla at Ramsgate.\"\n\nI crumpled the letter up in my hand. Nugent had justified my worst\nanticipations of what he would do in my absence. What did the true Mr.\nOscar Dubourg, reading that sentence at Marseilles, think of his brother\nnow? We are all mortal--we are all wicked. It is monstrous, but it is\ntrue. I had a moment's triumph.\n\nThe wicked moment gone, I was good again--that is to say, I was ashamed\nof myself.\n\nI smoothed out the letter, and looked eagerly for news of Lucilla's\nhealth. If the news was favorable, my letter committed to Miss\nBatchford's care must have been shown to Lucilla by this time; must have\nexposed Nugent's abominable personation of his brother; and must have\nthus preserved her for Oscar. In that case, all would be well again (and\nmy darling herself would own it)--thanks to Me!\n\nAfter telling me the news from Ramsgate, Mrs. Finch began to drift into,\nwhat you call, Twaddle. She had just discovered (exactly as Oscar had\nsupposed) that she had lost my letter. She would keep her own letter back\nuntil the next day, on the chance of finding it. If she failed she must\ntry Poste-Restante, at the suggestion (not of Mr. Finch--there I was\nwrong)--at the suggestion of Zillah, who had relatives in foreign parts,\nand had tried Poste-Restante in her case too. So Mrs. Finch driveled\nmildly on, in her large loose untidy handwriting, to the bottom of the\nthird page.\n\nI turned over. The handwriting suddenly grew untidier than ever; two\ngreat blots defaced the paper; the style became feebly hysterical. Good\nHeavens! what did I read when I made it out at last! See for yourselves;\nhere are the words: \"Some hours have passed--it is just tea-time---oh, my\ndear friend, I can hardly hold the pen, I tremble so--would you believe\nit, Miss Batchford has arrived at the rectory--she brings the dreadful\nnews that Lucilla has eloped with Oscar--we don't know why--we don't know\nwhere, except that they have gone away together privately--a letter from\nOscar tells Miss Batchford as much as that, and no more--oh, pray come\nback as soon as you can--Mr. Finch washes his hands of it--and Miss\nBatchford has left the house again in a fury with him--I am in dreadful\nagitation, and I have given it Mr. Finch says to baby, who is screaming\nblack in the face. Yours affectionately,\n\n\"AMELIA FINCH.\"\n\n\n\nAll the rages I had ever been in before in my life were as nothing\ncompared with the rage that devoured me when I had read that fourth page\nof Mrs. Finch's letter. Nugent had got the better of me and my\nprecautions! Nugent had robbed his brother of Lucilla, in the vilest\nmanner, with perfect impunity! I cast all feminine restraints to the\nwinds. I sat down with my legs anyhow, like a man. I rammed my hands into\nthe pockets of my dressing-gown. Did I cry? A word in your ear--and let\nit go no farther. I swore.\n\nHow long the fit lasted, I don't know. I only remember that I was\ndisturbed by a knock at my door.\n\nI flung open the door in a fury--and confronted Oscar on the threshold.\n\nThere was a look in his face that instantly quieted me. There was a tone\nin his voice that brought the tears suddenly into my eyes.\n\n\"I must leave for England in two hours,\" he said. \"Will you forgive me,\nMadame Pratolungo, before I go?\"\n\nOnly those words! And yet--if you had seen him, if you had heard him, as\nhe spoke them--you would have been ready as I was--not only to forgive\nhim--but to go to the ends of the earth with him; and you would have told\nhim so, as I did.\n\nIn two hours more, we were in the train, on our way to England.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-SEVENTH\n\nOn the Way to the End. First Stage\n\nYou will perhaps expect me to give some account of how Oscar bore the\ndiscovery of his brother's conduct.\n\nI find it by no means easy to do this. Oscar baffled me.\n\nThe first words of any importance which he addressed to me were spoken on\nour way to the station. Rousing himself from his own thoughts, he said\nvery earnestly----\n\n\"I want to know what conclusion you have drawn from Mrs. Finch's letter.\"\n\nNaturally enough, under the circumstances, I tried to avoid answering\nhim. He was not to be put off in that way.\n\n\"You will do me a favor,\" he went on, \"if you will reply to my question.\nThe letter has bred in me such a vile suspicion of my dear good brother,\nwho never deceived me in his life, that I would rather believe I am out\nof my mind than believe in my own interpretation of it. Do _you_ infer\nfrom what Mrs. Finch writes, that Nugent has presented himself to Lucilla\nunder my name? Do _you_ believe that he has persuaded her to leave her\nfriends, under the impression that she has yielded to My entreaties, and\ntrusted herself to My care?\"\n\nI answered in the fewest and plainest words, \"That is what your brother\nhas done.\"\n\nA sudden change passed over him. My reply seemed to have set his last\ndoubts at rest in an instant.\n\n\"That is what my brother has done,\" he repeated. \"After all that I\nsacrificed to him--after all that I trusted to his honor--when I left\nEngland.\" He paused, and considered a little. \"What does such a man\ndeserve?\" he went on; speaking to himself, in a low threatening tone that\nstartled me.\n\n\"He deserves,\" I said, \"what he will get when we reach England. You have\nonly to show yourself to make him repent his wickedness to the last day\nof his life. Are exposure and defeat not punishment enough for such a man\nas Nugent?\" I stopped, and waited for his answer.\n\nHe turned his face away from me, and said no more until we arrived at the\nstation. There, he drew me aside for a moment out of hearing of the\nstrangers about us.\n\n\"Why should I take you away from your father?\" he asked abruptly. \"I am\nbehaving very selfishly--and I only see it now.\"\n\n\"Make your mind easy,\" I said. \"If I had not met you to-day, I should\nhave gone to England to-morrow for Lucilla's sake.\"\n\n\"But now you _have_ met me,\" he persisted, \"why shouldn't I spare you the\njourney? I could write and tell you every thing--without putting you to\nthis fatigue and expense.\"\n\n\"If you say a word more,\" I answered, \"I shall think you have some reason\nof your own for wishing to go to England by yourself.\"\n\nHe cast one quick suspicious look at me--and led the way back to the\nbooking-office without uttering another word. I was not at all satisfied\nwith him. I thought his conduct very strange.\n\nIn silence we took our tickets; in silence, we got into the\nrailway-carriage. I attempted to say something encouraging, when we\nstarted. \"Don't notice me,\" was all he replied. \"You will be doing me a\nkindness, if you will let me bear it by myself.\" In my former experience\nof him, he had talked his way out of all his other troubles--he had\nclamorously demanded the expression of my sympathy with him. In this\ngreatest trouble, he was like another being; I hardly knew him again!\nWere the hidden reserves in his nature (stirred up by another serious\ncall on them) showing themselves once more on the surface as they had\nshown themselves already, on the fatal first day when Lucilla tried her\nsight? In that way I accounted for the mere superficial change in him, at\nthe time. What was actually going on below the surface it defied my\ningenuity even to guess. Perhaps I shall best describe the sort of vague\napprehension which he aroused in me--after what had passed between us at\nthe station--by saying that I would not for worlds have allowed him to go\nto England by himself.\n\nLeft as I now was to my own resources, I occupied the first hours of the\njourney, in considering what course it would be safest and best for us to\ntake, on reaching England.\n\nI decided, in the first place, that we ought to go straight to Dimchurch.\nIf any tidings had been obtained of Lucilla, they would be sure to have\nreceived them at the rectory. Our route, after reaching Paris, must be\ntherefore by way of Dieppe; thence across the Channel to Newhaven, near\nBrighton--and so to Dimchurch.\n\nIn the second place--assuming it to be always possible that we might see\nLucilla at the rectory--the risk of abruptly presenting Oscar to her in\nhis own proper person might, for all I knew to the contrary, be a very\nserious one. It would relieve us, as I thought, of a grave\nresponsibility, if we warned Grosse of our arrival, and so enabled him to\nbe present, if he thought it necessary, in the interests of Lucilla's\nhealth. I put this view (as also my plan for returning by way of Dieppe)\nto Oscar. He briefly consented to everything--he ungraciously left it all\nto me.\n\nAccordingly, on our arrival at Lyons, having some time for refreshment at\nour disposal before we went on, I telegraphed to Mr. Finch at the\nrectory, and to Grosse in London; informing them (as well as I could\ncalculate it) that, if we were lucky in catching trains and steamboats,\nOscar and I might be in Dimchurch in good time, on the next night--that\nis to say, on the night of the eighteenth. In any case, they were to\nexpect us at the earliest possible moment.\n\nThese difficulties disposed of, and a little store of refreshment for the\nnight packed in my basket, we re-entered the train, for our long journey\nto Paris.\n\nAmong the new passengers who joined us at Lyons was a gentleman whose\nface was English, and whose dress was the dress of a clergyman. For the\nfirst time in my life, I hailed the appearance of a priest with a feeling\nof relief. The reason was this. From the moment when I had read Mrs.\nFinch's letter until now, a horrid doubt, which a priest was just the man\nto solve, had laid its leaden weight on my mind--and, I firmly believe,\non Oscar's mind as well. Had time enough passed, since Lucilla had left\nRamsgate, to allow of Nugent's marrying her, under his brother's name?\n\nAs the train rolled out of the station, I, the enemy of priests, began to\nmake myself agreeable to _this_ priest. He was young and shy--but I\nconquered him. Just as the other travelers were beginning (with the\nexception of Oscar) to compose themselves to sleep, I put my case to the\nclergyman. \"A and B, sir, lady and gentleman, both of age, leave one\nplace in England, and go to live in another place, on the fifth of this\nmonth--how soon, if you please, can they be lawfully married after that?\"\n\n\"I presume you mean in church?\" said the young clergyman.\n\n\"In church, of course.\" (To that extent I believed I might answer for\nLucilla, without any fear of making a mistake.)\n\n\"They may be married by License,\" said the clergyman--\"provided one of\nthem continues to reside in that other place to which they traveled on\nthe fifth--on the twenty-first, or (possibly) even the twentieth of this\nmonth.\"\n\n\"Not before?\"\n\n\"Certainly not before.\"\n\nIt was then the night of the seventeenth. I gave my companion's hand a\nlittle squeeze in the dark. Here was a glimpse of encouragement to cheer\nus on the journey. Before the marriage could take place, we should be in\nEngland. \"We have time before us,\" I whispered to Oscar. \"We will save\nLucilla yet.\"\n\n\"Shall we find Lucilla?\" was all he whispered back.\n\nI had forgotten that serious difficulty. No answer to Oscar's question\ncould possibly present itself until we reached the rectory. Between this\nand then, there was nothing for it but to keep patience and to keep hope.\n\nI refrain from encumbering this part of my narrative with any detailed\naccount of the little accidents, lucky and unlucky, which alternately\nhastened or retarded our journey home. Let me only say that, before\nmidnight on the eighteenth, Oscar and I drove up to the rectory gate.\n\nMr. Finch himself came out to receive us, with a lamp in his hand. He\nlifted his eyes (and his lamp) devotionally to the sky when he saw Oscar.\nThe two first words he said, were:--\n\n\"Inscrutable Providence!\"\n\n\"Have you found Lucilla?\" I asked.\n\nMr. Finch--with his whole attention fixed on Oscar--wrung my hand\nmechanically, and said I was a \"good creature;\" much as he might have\npatted, and spoken to, Oscar's companion, if the companion had been a\ndog. I almost wished myself that animal for the moment--I should have had\nthe privilege of biting Mr. Finch. Oscar impatiently repeated my\nquestion; the rector, at the time, officiously assisting him to descend\nfrom the carriage, and leaving me to get out as I could.\n\n\"Did you hear Madame Pratolungo?\" Oscar asked. \"Is Lucilla found?\"\n\n\"Dear Oscar, we hope to find her, now you have come.\"\n\nThat answer revealed to me the secret of Mr. Finch's extraordinary\npoliteness to his young friend. The last chance, as things were, of\npreventing Lucilla's marriage to a man who had squandered away every\nfarthing of his money, was the chance of Oscar's arrival in England\nbefore the ceremony could take place. The measure of Oscar's importance\nto Mr. Finch was now, more literally than ever, the measure of Oscar's\nfortune.\n\nI asked for news of Grosse as we went in. The rector actually found some\ncomparatively high notes in his prodigious voice, to express his\namazement at my audacity in speaking to him of anybody but Oscar.\n\n\"Oh, dear, dear me!\" cried Mr. Finch, impatiently conceding to me one\nprecious moment of his attention. \"Don't bother about Grosse! Grosse is\nill in London. There is a note for you from Grosse.--Take care of the\ndoor-step, dear Oscar,\" he went on, in his deepest and gravest bass\nnotes. \"Mrs. Finch is so anxious to see you. We have both looked forward\nto your arrival with such eager hope--such impatient affection, so to\nspeak. Let me put down your hat. Ah! how you must have suffered! Share my\ntrust in an all-wise Providence, and meet this trial with cheerful\nsubmission as I do. All is not lost yet. Bear up! bear up!\" He threw open\nthe parlor door. \"Mrs. Finch! compose yourself. Our dear adopted son. Our\nafflicted Oscar!\"\n\nIs it necessary to say what Mrs. Finch was about, and how Mrs. Finch\nlooked?\n\nThere were the three unchangeable institutions--the novel, the baby, and\nthe missing pocket-handkerchief There was the gaudy jacket over the long\ntrailing dressing-gown--and the damp lady inside them, damp as ever!\nReceiving Oscar with a mouth drawn down at the corners, and a head that\nshook sadly in sympathy with him, Mrs. Finch's face underwent a most\nextraordinary transformation when she turned my way next. To my\nastonishment, her dim eyes actually sparkled; a broad smile of\nirrepressible contentment showed itself cunningly to _me,_ in place of\nthe dismal expression which had welcomed Oscar. Holding up the baby in\ntriumph, the lady of the rectory whispered these words in my ear:--\"What\ndo you think he has done since you have been away?\"\n\n\"I really don't know,\" I answered.\n\n\"He has cut two teeth! Put your finger in and feel.\"\n\nOthers might bewail the family misfortune. The family triumph filled the\nsecret mind of Mrs. Finch, to the exclusion of every other earthly\nconsideration. I put my finger in as instructed, and got instantly bitten\nby the ferocious baby. But for a new outburst of the rector's voice at\nthe moment, Mrs. Finch (if I am any judge of physiognomy) must have\ncertainly relieved herself by a scream of delight. As it was, she opened\nher mouth; and (having lost her handkerchief as already stated) retired\ninto a corner, and gagged herself with the baby.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Finch had produced from a cupboard near the\nfireplace, two letters. The first he threw down impatiently on the table.\n\"Oh, dear, dear! what a nuisance other people's letters are!\" The second\nhe handled with extraordinary care; offering it to Oscar with a heavy\nsigh, and with eyes that turned up martyr-like to the ceiling. \"Rouse\nyourself, and read it,\" said Mr. Finch in his most pathetic pulpit tones.\n\"I would have spared you, Oscar, if I could. All our hopes depend, dear\nboy, on what you can say to guide us when you have read those lines.\"\n\nOscar took the enclosure out of the envelope--ran over the first\nwords--glanced at the signature--and, with a look of mingled rage and\nhorror, threw the letter on the floor.\n\n\"Don't ask me to read it!\" he cried, in the first burst of passion which\nhad escaped him yet. \"If I read it, I shall kill him when we meet.\" He\ndropped into a chair, and hid his face in his hands. \"Oh, Nugent! Nugent!\nNugent!\" he moaned to himself, with a cry that was dreadful to hear.\n\nIt was no time for standing on ceremony. I picked up the letter, and\nlooked at it without asking leave. It proved to be the letter from Nugent\n(already inserted at the close of Lucilla's Journal), informing Miss\nBatchford of her niece's flight from Ramsgate, and signed in Oscar's\nname. The only words which it is necessary to repeat here, are\nthese:--\"She accompanies me, at my express request, to the house of a\nmarried lady who is a relative of mine, and under whose care she will\nremain, until the time arrives for our marriage.\"\n\nThose lines instantly lightened my heart of the burden that had oppressed\nit on the journey. Nugent's married relative was Oscar's married relative\ntoo. Oscar had only to tell us where the lady lived--and Lucilla would be\nfound!\n\nI stopped Mr. Finch, in the act of maddening Oscar by administering\npastoral consolation to him.\n\n\"Leave it to me,\" I said, showing him the letter. \"I know what you want.\"\n\nThe rector stared at me indignantly. I turned to Mrs. Finch.\n\n\"We have had a weary journey,\" I went on. \"Oscar is not so well used to\ntraveling as I am. Where is his room?\"\n\nMrs. Finch rose to show the way. Her husband opened his lips to\ninterfere.\n\n\"Leave it to me,\" I repeated. \"I understand him; and you don't.\"\n\nFor once in his life, the Pope of Dimchurch was reduced to silence. His\namazement at my audacity defied even his powers of expression. I took\nOscar's arm, and said, \"You are worn out. Go to your room. I will make\nyou something warm and bring it up to you myself in a few minutes.\" He\nneither looked at me nor answered me--he yielded silently and followed\nMrs. Finch. I took from the sideboard, on which supper was waiting, the\nmaterials I wanted; set the kettle boiling; made my renovating mixture;\nand advanced to the door with it--followed from first to last, move where\nI might, by the staring and scandalized eyes of Mr. Finch. The moment in\nwhich I opened the door was also the moment in which the rector recovered\nhimself. \"Permit me to inquire, Madame Pratolungo,\" he said with his\nloftiest emphasis, \"in what capacity are You here?\"\n\n\"In the capacity of Oscar's friend,\" I answered. \"You will get rid of us\nboth to-morrow.\" I banged the door behind me, and went up-stairs. If I\nhad been Mr. Finch's wife, I believe I should have ended in making quite\nan agreeable man of him.\n\nMrs. Finch met me in the passage on the first floor, and pointed out\nOscar's room. I found him walking backwards and forwards restlessly. The\nfirst words he said alluded to his brother's letter. I had arranged not\nto disturb him by any reference to that painful matter until the next\nmorning; and I tried to change the topic. It was useless. There was an\nanxiety in his mind which was not to be dismissed at will. He insisted on\nmy instantly setting that anxiety at rest.\n\n\"I don't want to see the letter,\" he said. \"I only want to know all that\nit says about Lucilla.\"\n\n\"All that it says may be summed up in this. Lucilla is perfectly safe.\"\n\nHe caught me by the arm, and looked me searchingly in the face.\n\n\"Where?\" he asked. \"With _him?_\"\n\n\"With a married lady who is a relative of his.\"\n\nHe dropped my arm, and considered for a moment.\n\n\"My cousin at Sydenham!\" he exclaimed.\n\n\"Do you know the house?\"\n\n\"Perfectly well.\"\n\n\"We will go there to-morrow. Let that content you for tonight. Get to\nrest.\"\n\nI gave him my hand. He took it mechanically--absorbed in his own\nthoughts.\n\n\"Didn't I say something foolish down stairs?\" he asked, putting the\nquestion suddenly, with an odd suspicious look at me.\n\n\"You were quite worn out,\" I said, consolingly. \"Nobody noticed it.\"\n\n\"You are sure of that?\"\n\n\"Quite sure. Good night.\"\n\nI left the room, feeling much as I had felt at the station at Marseilles.\nI was not satisfied with him. I thought his conduct very strange.\n\n\n\nOn returning to the parlor, I found nobody there but Mrs. Finch. The\nrector's offended dignity had left the rector no honorable alternative\nbut to withdraw to his own room. I ate my supper in peace; and Mrs. Finch\n(rocking the cradle with her foot) chattered away to her heart's content\nabout all that had happened in my absence.\n\nI gathered, here and there, from what she said, some particulars worth\nmentioning.\n\nThe new disagreement between Mr. Finch and Miss Batchford, which had\ndriven the old lady out of the rectory almost as soon as she set foot in\nit, had originated in Mr. Finch's exasperating composure when he heard of\nhis daughter's flight. He supposed, of course, that Lucilla had left\nRamsgate with Oscar--whose signed settlements on his future wife were\nsafe in Mr. Finch's possession. It was only when Miss Batchford had\ncommunicated with Grosse, and when the discovery followed which revealed\nthe penniless Nugent as the man who had eloped with Lucilla, that Mr.\nFinch's parental anxiety (seeing no money likely to come of it) became\nroused to action. He, Miss Batchford, and Grosse, had all, in their\nvarious ways, done their best to trace the fugitives--and had all alike\nbeen baffled by the impossibility of discovering the residence of the\nlady mentioned in Nugent's letter. My telegram, announcing my return to\nEngland with Oscar, had inspired them with their first hope of being able\nto interfere, and stop the marriage before it was too late.\n\nThe occurrence of Grosse's name in Mrs. Finch's rambling narrative,\nrecalled to my memory what the rector had told me at the garden gate. I\nhad not yet received the letter which the German had sent to wait my\narrival at Dimchurch. After a short search, we found it--where it had\nbeen contemptuously thrown by Mr. Finch--on the parlor table.\n\nA few lines comprised the whole letter. Grosse informed me that he had so\nfretted himself about Lucilla, that he had been attacked by \"a visitation\nof gouts.\" It was impossible to move his \"foots\" without instantly\nplunging into the torture of the infernal regions. \"If it is you, my goot\ndear, who are going to find her,\" he concluded, \"come to me first in\nLondon. I have something most dismal-serious to say to you about our poor\nlittle Feench's eyes.\"\n\nNo words can tell how that last sentence startled and grieved me. Mrs.\nFinch increased my anxiety and alarm by repeating what she had heard Miss\nBatchford say, during her brief visit to the rectory, on the subject of\nLucilla's sight. Grosse had been seriously dissatisfied with the state of\nhis patient's eyes, when he had seen them as long ago as the fourth of\nthe month; and, on the morning of the next day, the servant had reported\nLucilla as being hardly able to distinguish objects in the view from the\nwindow of her room. Later on the same day, she had secretly left\nRamsgate; and Grosse's letter proved that she had not been near her\nsurgical attendant since.\n\nWeary as I was after the journey, this miserable news kept me waking long\nafter I had gone to my bed. The next morning, I was up with the\nservants--impatient to start for London, by the first train.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-EIGHTH\n\nOn the Way to the End. Second Stage\n\nEARLY riser as I was, I found that Oscar had risen earlier still. He had\nleft the rectory and had disturbed Mr. Gootheridge's morning slumbers by\nan application at the inn for the key of Browndown.\n\nOn his return to the rectory, he merely said that he had been to see\nafter various things belonging to him, which were still left in the empty\nhouse. His look and manner as he gave us this brief explanation were, to\nmy mind, more unsatisfactory than ever. I made no remark; and, observing\nthat his loose traveling coat was buttoned awry over the breast, I set it\nright for him. My hand, as I did this, touched his breast-pocket. He\nstarted back directly--as if there was something in the pocket which he\ndid not wish me to feel. Was it something he had brought from Browndown?\n\nWe got away--encumbered by Mr. Finch, who insisted on attaching himself\nto Oscar--by the first express train, which took us straight to London.\nComparison of time-tables, on reaching the terminus, showed that I had\nleisure to spare for a brief visit to Grosse, before we again took the\nrailway back to Sydenham. Having decided not to mention the bad news\nabout Lucilla's sight to Oscar, until I had seen the German first, I made\nthe best excuse that suggested itself, and drove away--leaving the two\ngentlemen in the waiting-room at the station.\n\nI found Grosse confined to his easy-chair, with his gouty foot enveloped\nin cool cabbage-leaves. Between pain and anxiety, his eyes were wilder,\nhis broken English was more grotesque than ever. When I appeared at the\ndoor of his room and said good morning--in the frenzy of his impatience\nhe shook his fist at me.\n\n\"Good morning go-damn!\" he roared out, \"Where? where? where is Feench?\"\n\nI told him where we believed Lucilla to be. Grosse turned his head, and\nshook his fist at a bottle on the chimney-piece next.\n\n\"Get that bottles on the chimney,\" he said. \"And the eye-baths by the\nside of him. Don't stop with your talky-talky-chatterations here. Go!\nSave her eyes. Look! You do this. You throw her head back--soh!\" He\nillustrated the position so forcibly with his own head that he shook his\ngouty foot, and screamed with the pain of it. He went on nevertheless,\nglaring frightfully through his spectacles; gnashing his mustache\nfiercely between his teeth. \"Throw her head back. Fill the eye-baths;\nturn him upsides-down over her open eyes. Drown them turn-turn-about in\nmy mixtures. Drown them, I say, one-down-todder-come-on, and if she\nscreech never mind it. Then bring her to me. For the lofe of Gott, bring\nher to me. If you tie her hands and foots, bring her to me. What is the\nwomans stopping for? Go! go! go!\"\n\n\"I want to ask you a question about Oscar,\" I said, \"before I go.\"\n\nHe seized the pillow which supported his head--evidently intending to\nexpedite my departure by throwing it at me. I produced the railway\ntime-table as the best defensive weapon at my command. \"Look at it for\nyourself,\" I said; \"and you will see that I must wait at the station, if\nI don't wait here.\"\n\nWith some difficulty, I satisfied him that it was impossible to leave\nLondon for Sydenham before a certain hour, and that I had at least ten\nminutes to spare which might be just as well passed in consulting him. He\nclosed his glaring eyes, and laid his head back on the chair, thoroughly\nexhausted with his own outbreak of excitement. \"No matter how things\ngoes,\" he said, \"a womans must wag her tongue. Goot. Wag yours.\"\n\n\"I am placed in a very difficult position,\" I began. \"Oscar is going with\nme to Lucilla. I shall of course take care, in the first place, that he\nand Nugent do not meet, unless I am present at the interview. But I am\nnot equally sure of what I ought to do in the case of Lucilla. Must I\nkeep them apart until I have first prepared her to see Oscar?\"\n\n\"Let her see the devil himself if you like,\" growled Grosse, \"so long as\nyou bring her here afterwards-directly to me. You will do the bettermost\nthing, if you prepare Oscar. _She_ wants no preparations! She is enough\ndisappointed in him as it is!\"\n\n\"Disappointed in him!\" I repeated. \"I don't understand you.\"\n\nHe settled himself wearily in his chair, and referred, in a softened and\nsaddened tone, to that private conversation of his with Lucilla, at\nRamsgate, which has already been reported in the Journal. I was now\ninformed, for the first time, of those changes in her sensations and in\nher ways of thinking which had so keenly vexed and mortified her. I heard\nof the ominous absence of the old thrill of pleasure, when Nugent took\nher hand on meeting her at the seaside--I heard how bitterly his personal\nappearance had disappointed her (when she had seen his features in\ndetail) by comparison with the charming ideal picture which she had\nformed of her lover in the days of her blindness: those happier days, as\nshe had called them, when she was Poor Miss Finch.\n\n\"Surely,\" I said, \"all the old feelings will come back to her when she\nsees Oscar?\"\n\n\"They will never come back to her--no, not if she sees fifty Oscars!\"\n\nHe was beginning to frighten me, or to irritate me--I can hardly say\nwhich. I only know that I persisted in disputing with him. \"When she sees\nthe true man,\" I went on, \"do you mean to say she will feel the same\ndisappointment----?\"\n\nI could get no farther than that. He cut me short there, without\nceremony.\n\n\"You foolish womans!\" he interposed, \"she will feel more than the same. I\nhave told you already it was one enormous disappointments to her when she\nsaw the handsome brodder with the fair complexions. Ask your own self\nwhat it will be when she sees the ugly brodder with the blue face. I tell\nyou this!--she will think your true man the worst impostor of the two.\"\n\nThere I indignantly contradicted him.\n\n\"His face _may_ be a disappointment to her,\" I said--\"I own that. But\nthere it will end. Her hand will tell her, when he takes it, that there\nis no impostor deceiving her this time.\"\n\n\"Her hand will tell her nothing--no more than yours. I had not so much\nhard hearts in me as to say that to _her,_ when she asked me. I say it to\n_you._ Hold your tongue and listen. All those thrill-tingles that she\nonce had when he touched her, belong to anodder time--the time gone-by\nwhen her sight was in her fingers and not in her eyes. With those\nfine-superfine-feelings of the days when she was blind, she pays now for\nher grand new privilege of opening her eyes on the world. (And worth the\nprice too!) Do you understand yet? It is a sort of swop-bargain between\nNature and this poor girls of ours. I take away your eyes--I give you\nyour fine touch. I give you your eyes--I take away your fine touch. Soh!\nthat is plain. You see now.\"\n\nI was too mortified and too miserable to answer him. Through all our\nlater troubles, I had looked forward so confidently to Oscar's\nre-appearance as the one sufficient condition on which Lucilla's\nhappiness would be certainly restored! What had become of my\nanticipations now? I sat silent; staring in stupid depression at the\npattern of the carpet. Grosse took out his watch.\n\n\"Your ten-minutes-time has counted himself out,\" he said.\n\nI neither moved nor heeded him. His ferocious eyes began to flame again\nbehind his monstrous spectacles.\n\n\"Go-be-off-with-you!\" he shouted at me as if I was deaf. \"Her eyes! her\neyes! While you stop chatterboxing here, her eyes are in danger. What\nwith her frettings and her cryings and her damn-nonsense-lofe-business, I\nswear you my solemn oath her sight was in danger when I saw her a whole\nfortnight gone-by. Do you want my big pillow to fly bang at your head?\nYou don't want him? Be-off-away with you then, or you will have him in\none-two-three time! Be-off-away--and bring her back to me before night!\"\n\nI returned to the railway. Of all the women whom I passed in the crowded\nstreets, I doubt if one had a heavier heart in her bosom that morning\nthan mine.\n\nTo make matters worse still, my traveling companions (one in the\nrefreshment-room, and one pacing the platform) received my account of my\ninterview with Grosse in a manner which seriously disappointed and\ndiscouraged me. Mr. Finch's inhuman conceit treated my melancholy news of\nhis daughter as a species of complimentary tribute to his own foresight.\n\n\"You remember, Madame Pratolungo, I took high ground in this matter from\nthe first. I protested against the proceedings of the man Grosse, as\ninvolving a purely worldly interference with the ways of an inscrutable\nProvidence. With what effect? My paternal influence was repudiated; my\nMoral Weight was, so to speak, set aside. And now you see the result.\nTake it to heart, dear friend. May it be a warning to you!\" He sighed\nwith ponderous complacency, and turned from me to the girl behind the\ncounter. \"I will take another cup of tea.\"\n\nOscar's reception of me, when I found him on the platform, and told him\nnext of Lucilla's critical state, was more than discouraging. It is no\nexaggeration to say that he alarmed me. \"Another item in the debt I owe\nto Nugent!\" he said. Not a word of sympathy, not a word of sorrow. That\nvindictive answer, and nothing more.\n\nWe started for Sydenham.\n\nFrom time to time, I looked at Oscar sitting opposite to me, to see if\nany change appeared in him as we drew nearer and nearer to the place in\nwhich Lucilla was now living. No! Still the same ominous silence, the\nsame unnatural self-repression possessed him.\n\nExcept the momentary outbreak, when Mr. Finch had placed Nugent's letter\nin his hand on the previous evening, not the faintest token of what was\nreally going on in his mind had escaped him since we had left Marseilles.\nHe, who could weep over all his other griefs as easily and as\nspontaneously as a woman, had not shed a tear since the fatal day when he\nhad discovered that his brother had played him false--that brother who\nhad been the god of his idolatry, the sacred object of his gratitude and\nhis love! When a man of Oscar's temperament becomes frozen up for days\ntogether in his own thoughts--when he keeps his own counsel; when he asks\nfor no sympathy, and utters no complaint--the sign is a serious one.\nThere are hidden forces gathering in him which will burst their way to\nthe surface--for good or for evil--with an irresistible result. Watching\nOscar attentively behind my veil, I felt the certain assurance that the\npart he would take in the terrible conflict of interests now awaiting us,\nwould be a part which I should remember to the latest day of my life.\n\nWe reached Sydenham, and went to the nearest hotel.\n\nOn the railway--with other travelers in the carriage-it had been\nimpossible to consult on the safest method of approaching Lucilla, in the\nfirst instance. That serious question now pressed for instant decision.\nWe sat down to discuss it, in the room which we had hired at the hotel.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FORTY-NINTH\n\nOn the Way to the End. Third Stage\n\nON former occasions of doubt or difficulty, it had always been Oscar's\nhabit to follow the opinions of others. On this occasion he was the first\nto speak, and to assert an opinion of his own.\n\n\"It seems needless to waste time in discussing our different views,\" he\nsaid. \"There is only one thing to be done. I am the person principally\nconcerned in this matter. Wait here, while I go to the house.\"\n\nHe spoke without any of his usual hesitation; he took up his hat without\nlooking either at Mr. Finch or at me. I felt more and more convinced that\nthe influence which Nugent's vile breach of confidence had exerted over\nOscar's mind, was an influence which had made a dangerous man of him.\nResolved to prevent him from leaving us, I insisted on his returning to\nhis chair, and hearing what I had to say. At the same moment, Mr. Finch\nrose, and placed himself between Oscar and the door. Seeing this, I\nthought it might be wise if I kept my interference in reserve, and\nallowed the rector to speak first.\n\n\"Wait a moment, Oscar,\" said Mr. Finch, gravely. \"You are forgetting Me.\"\n\nOscar waited doggedly, hat in hand.\n\nMr. Finch paused, evidently considering what words he should use before\nhe spoke again. His respect for Oscar's pecuniary position was great; but\nhis respect for himself--especially at the present crisis--was, if\npossible, greater still. In deference to the first sentiment he was as\npolite, and in deference to the second he was as positive, in phrasing\nhis remonstrance, as a man could be. \"Permit me to remind you, dear\nOscar, that my claim to interfere, as Lucilla's father, is at least equal\nto yours,\" proceeded the rector. \"In the hour of my daughter's need, it\nis my parental duty to be present. If you go to your cousin's house, my\nposition imperatively requires that I should go too.\" Oscar's reception\nof this proposal confirmed the grave apprehensions with which he had\ninspired me. He flatly refused to have Mr. Finch for a companion.\n\n\"Excuse me,\" he answered shortly. \"I wish to go to the house alone.\"\n\n\"Permit me to ask your reason,\" said the rector, still preserving his\nconciliatory manner.\n\n\"I wish to see my brother in private,\" Oscar replied, with his eyes on\nthe ground.\n\nMr. Finch, still restraining himself, but still not moving from the door,\nlooked at me. I hastened to interfere before there was any serious\ndisagreement between them.\n\n\"I venture to think,\" I said, \"that you are both wrong. Whether one of\nyou goes, or both of you go, the result will be the same. The chances are\na hundred to one, against your being admitted into the house.\"\n\nThey both turned on me together, and asked what I meant.\n\n\"You can't force your way in,\" I said. \"You must do one of two things.\nYou must either give your names to the servant at the door, or you must\nwithhold your names. If you give them, you warn Nugent of what is\ncoming--and he is not the man to let you into the house under those\ncircumstances. If you take the other way, and keep your names concealed,\nyou present yourselves as strangers. Is Nugent likely to be accessible to\nstrangers? Would Lucilla, in her present position, consent to receive two\nmen who are unknown to her? Take my word for it--you will not only gain\nnothing if you go to the house you will actually make it more difficult\nto communicate with Lucilla than it is already.\"\n\nThere was a moment's silence. Both the men felt that my objections were\nnot easy to answer. Once more, Oscar took the lead.\n\n\"Do you propose to go?\" he asked.\n\n\"No,\" I answered. \"I propose to send a letter to Lucilla. A letter will\nfind its way to her.\"\n\nThis again was unanswerable. Oscar inquired next what the purport of the\nletter was to be. I replied that I proposed to ask her to grant me a\nprivate interview--nothing more.\n\n\"Suppose Lucilla refuses?\" said Mr. Finch.\n\n\"She will not refuse,\" I rejoined. \"There was a little misunderstanding\nbetween us--I admit--at the time when I went abroad. I mean to refer\nfrankly to that misunderstanding as my reason for writing. I shall put\nyour daughter on her honor to give me an opportunity of setting things\nright between us. If I summon Lucilla to do an act of justice, I believe\nshe will not refuse me.\"\n\n(This, let me add in parenthesis, was the plan of action which I had\nformed on the way to Sydenham. I had only waited to mention it, until I\nheard what the two men proposed to do first.)\n\nOscar, standing hat in hand, glanced at Mr. Finch (also hat in hand)\nkeeping obstinately near the door. If he persisted in carrying out his\npurpose of going alone to his cousin's house, the rector's face and\nmanner expressed, with the politest plainness, the intention of following\nhim. Oscar was placed between a clergyman and a woman, both equally\ndetermined to have their own way. Under those circumstances, there was no\nalternative--unless he wished to produce a public scandal--but to yield,\nor appear to yield, to one or the other of us. He selected me.\n\n\"If you succeed in seeing her,\" he asked, \"what do you mean to do?\"\n\n\"I mean either to bring her back with me here to her father and to you,\nor to make an appointment with her to see you both where she is now\nliving,\" I replied.\n\nOscar--after another look at the immovable rector--rang the bell, and\nordered writing materials.\n\n\"One more question,\" he said. \"Assuming that Lucilla receives you at the\nhouse, do you intend to see----?\" He stopped; his eyes shrank from\nmeeting mine. \"Do you intend to see anybody else?\" he resumed: still\nevading the plain utterance of his brother's name.\n\n\"I intend to see nobody but Lucilla,\" I answered. \"It is no business of\nmine to interfere between you and your brother.\" (Heaven forgive me for\nspeaking in that way to him, while I had the firm resolution to interfere\nbetween them in my mind all the time!)\n\n\"Write your letter,\" he said, \"on condition that I see the reply.\"\n\n\"It is needless, I presume, for me to make the same stipulation?\" added\nthe rector. \"In my parental capacity--\"\n\nI recognized his parental capacity, before he could say any more. \"You\nshall both see the reply,\" I said--and sat down to my letter; writing\nmerely what I had told them I should write: \"Dear Lucilla, I have just\nreturned from the Continent. For the sake of justice, and for the sake of\nold times, let me see you immediately--without mentioning our appointment\nto anybody. I pledge myself to satisfy you, in five minutes, that I have\nnever been unworthy of your affection and your confidence. The bearer\nwaits for your reply.\"\n\nI handed those lines to the two gentlemen to read. Mr. Finch made no\nremark--he was palpably dissatisfied at the secondary position which he\noccupied. Oscar said, \"I see no objection to the letter. I will do\nnothing until I have read the answer.\" With those words, he dictated to\nme his cousin's address. I gave the letter myself to one of the servants\nat the hotel.\n\n\"Is it far from here?\" I asked.\n\n\"Barely ten minutes' walk, ma'am.\"\n\n\"You understand that you are to wait for an answer?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\nHe went out. As well as I can remember, an interval of at least half an\nhour passed before his return. You will form some idea of the terrible\noppression of suspense that now laid its slowly-torturing weight on all\nthree of us, when I tell you that not one word was spoken in the room\nfrom the time when the servant went out, to the time when the servant\ncame in again.\n\nWhen the man returned he had a letter in his hand!\n\nMy fingers shook so that I could hardly open it. Before I had read a\nword, the sight of the writing struck a sudden chill through me. The body\nof the note was written by the hand of a stranger! And the signature at\nthe end was traced in the large straggling childish characters which I\nremembered so well, when Lucilla had written her first letter to Oscar in\nthe days when she was blind!\n\nThe note was expressed in these strange words:--\"I cannot receive you\nhere; but I can, and will, come to you at your hotel if you will wait for\nme. I am not able to appoint a time. I can only promise to watch for my\nfirst opportunity, and to take advantage of it instantly--for your sake\nand for mine.\"\n\nBut one interpretation could be placed on such language as this. Lucilla\nwas not a free agent. Both Oscar and the rector were now obliged to\nacknowledge that my view of the case had been the correct one. If it was\nimpossible for me to be received into the house, how doubly impossible\nwould it be for the men to gain admission! Oscar, after reading the note,\nwithdrew to the further end of the room; keeping his thoughts to himself.\nMr. Finch decided on stepping out of his secondary position by forthwith\ntaking a course of his own.\n\n\"Am I to infer,\" he began, \"that it is really useless for me to attempt\nto see my own child?\"\n\n\"Her letter speaks for itself,\" I replied. \"If you attempt to see her,\nyou will probably be the means of preventing your daughter from coming\nhere.\"\n\n\"In my parental capacity,\" continued Mr. Finch, \"it is impossible for me\nto remain passive. As a brother-clergyman, I have, I conceive, a claim on\nthe rector of the parish. It is quite likely that notice may have been\nalready given of this fraudulent marriage. In that case, it is not only\nmy duty to myself and my child--it is my duty to the Church, to confer\nwith my reverend colleague. I go to confer with him.\" He strutted to the\ndoor, and added, \"If Lucilla arrives in my absence, I invest you with my\nauthority, Madame Pratolungo, to detain her until my return.\" With that\nparting charge to me, he walked out.\n\nI looked at Oscar. He came slowly towards me from the other end of the\nroom.\n\n\"You will wait here, of course?\" he said.\n\n\"Of course. And you?\"\n\n\"I shall go out for a little while.\"\n\n\"For any particular purpose?\"\n\n\"No. To get through the time. I am weary of waiting.\"\n\nI felt positively assured, from the manner in which he answered me, that\nhe was going--now he had got rid of Mr. Finch--straight to his cousin's\nhouse.\n\n\"You forget,\" I said, \"that Lucilla may come here while you are out. Your\npresence in the room, or in the room next to this, may be of the greatest\nimportance, when I tell her what your brother has done. Suppose she\nrefuses to believe me? What am I to do if I have not got you to appeal\nto? In your own interests, as well as in Lucilla's, I request you to\nremain here with me till she comes.\"\n\nPutting it on that ground only, I waited to see what he would do. After a\ncertain hesitation, he answered with a sullen assumption of indifference,\n\"Just as you please!\"--and walked away again towards the other end of the\nroom. As he turned his back on me, I heard him say to himself, \"It's only\nwaiting a little longer!\"\n\n\"Waiting for what?\" I asked.\n\nHe looked round at me over his shoulder.\n\n\"Patience for the present!\" he answered. \"You will hear soon enough.\" For\nthe moment, I said no more to him. The tone in which he had replied\nwarned me that it would be useless.\n\nAfter an interval--how long an interval I cannot well say--I heard the\nsound of women's dresses in the passage outside.\n\nThe instant after, there was a knock at the door.\n\nI signed to Oscar to open a second door, close by him at the lower end of\nthe room, and (for the moment at least) to keep out of sight. Then I\nanswered the knock, and said as steadily as I could, \"Come in.\"\n\nA woman unknown to me entered, dressed like a respectable servant. She\ncame in leading Lucilla by the hand. My first look at my darling told me\nthe horrible truth. As I had seen her in the corridor at the rectory on\nthe first day we met, so I now saw her once more. Again, the sightless\neyes turned on me, insensibly reflecting the light that fell on them.\nBlind! Oh, God, after a few brief weeks of sight, blind again!\n\nIn that miserable discovery, I forgot everything else. I flew to her, and\ncaught her in my arms. I cast one look at her pale, wasted face--and\nburst out crying on her bosom.\n\nShe held my head gently with one hand, and waited with the patience of an\nangel until that first outbreak of my grief had exhausted itself. \"Don't\ncry about my blindness,\" said the soft, sweet voice that I knew so well.\n\"The days when I had my sight have been the unhappiest days of my life.\nIf I look as if I had been fretting, don't think it is about my eyes.\"\nShe paused, and sighed bitterly. \"I may tell _you,_\" she went on in a\nwhisper. \"It's a relief, it's a consolation, to tell _you._ I am fretting\nabout my marriage.\"\n\nThose words roused me. I lifted my head, and kissed her. \"I have come\nback to comfort you,\" I said: \"and I have behaved like a fool.\"\n\nShe smiled faintly. \"How like you,\" she exclaimed, \"to say that!\" She\ntapped my cheek with her fingers in the old familiar way. The repetition\nof that little trifling action almost broke my heart. I nearly choked\nmyself in forcing back the stupid cowardly useless tears that tried to\nburst from me again. \"Come!\" she said. \"No more crying! Let us sit down\nand talk as if we were at Dimchurch.\"\n\nI took her to the sofa: we sat side by side. She put her arm round my\nwaist, and laid her head on my shoulder. Again the faint smile flickered\nlike a dying light on her lovely face; wan and wasted, yet still\nbeautiful--still the Virgin's face in Raphael's picture. \"We are a\nstrange pair,\" she said, with a momentary flash of her old irresistible\nhumour. \"You are my bitterest enemy, and you burst out crying over me the\nmoment we meet. I have been shockingly treated by you--and I have got my\narm round your waist and my head on your shoulder, and I wouldn't let go\nof you for the world!\" Her face saddened again; her voice suddenly\naltered its tone. \"Tell me,\" she went on, \"how is it that appearances\nwere so terribly against you? Oscar satisfied me, at Ramsgate, that I\nought to give you up, that I ought never to see you again. I took his\nview--there is no denying it, my dear--I agreed with him in detesting\nyou, for a little while. But, when the blindness came back, I could keep\nit up no longer. Little by little, as the light died out, my heart\n_would_ turn to you again. When I heard your letter read, when I knew\nthat you were near me--it was just like the old times; I was mad to see\nyou. And here I am--satisfied, before you explain it to me, that you have\nbeen the victim of some terrible mistake.\"\n\nI tried, in grateful acknowledgment of those generous words, to enter on\nmy justification there and then. It was impossible. I could think of\nnothing, I could speak of nothing, but the dreadful discovery of her\nblindness.\n\n\"Give me a few minutes,\" I said, \"and you shall hear it all. I can't talk\nof myself, yet--I can only talk of you. Oh, Lucilla, why did you keep\naway from Grosse? Come with me to him to-day. Let him try what he can do.\nAt once, my love--before it is too late!\"\n\n\"It _is_ too late,\" she said. \"I have been to another oculist--a\nstranger. He said, what Mr. Sebright said: he doubted if there was ever\nany chance for me: he thought the operation ought never to have been\nperformed.\"\n\n\"Why did you go to a stranger?\" I asked. \"Why did you give up Grosse!\"\n\n\"You must ask Oscar,\" she answered. \"It was at his desire that I kept\naway from Grosse.\"\n\nHearing this, I penetrated for myself the motive which had actuated\nNugent--as I afterwards found it indicated in the Journal. If he had let\nLucilla go to Grosse, our good German might have noticed that her\nposition was preying on her mind, and might have seen his reasons for\nexposing the deception that Nugent was practicing on her. For the rest, I\nstill persisted in entreating Lucilla to go back with me to our old\nfriend.\n\n\"Remember our conversation on this very subject,\" she rejoined, shaking\nher head decisively. \"I mean at the time when the operation was going to\nbe performed. I told you I was used to being blind. I said I only wanted\nto recover my sight, to see Oscar. And when I did see him--what happened?\nThe disappointment was so dreadful, I wished myself blind again. Don't\nstart! don't cry out as if you were shocked! I mean what I say. You\npeople who can see, attach such an absurd importance to your eyes! Don't\nyou recollect my saying that, when we last talked about it?\"\n\nI recollected perfectly. She had said those words. She had declared that\nshe had never honestly envied any of us the use of our eyes. She had even\nreviled our eyes; comparing them contemptuously with _her_ touch;\nderiding them as deceivers who were constantly leading us wrong. I\nacknowledged all this--without being in the least reconciled to the\ncatastrophe that had happened. If she would only have listened to me, I\nshould still have gone on obstinately pleading with her. But she flatly\nrefused to listen. \"We have very little time to spare,\" she said. \"Let us\ntalk of something more interesting before I am obliged to leave you.\"\n\n\"Obliged to leave me?\" I repeated. \"Are you not your own mistress?\"\n\nHer face clouded over; her manner became embarrassed.\n\n\"I cannot honestly tell you that I am a prisoner,\" she answered. \"I can\nonly say I am watched. When Oscar is away from me, Oscar's cousin--a sly,\nsuspicious, false woman--always contrives to put herself in his place. I\nheard her say to her husband that she believed I should break my marriage\nengagement unless I was closely looked after. I don't know what I should\ndo, but for one of the servants in the house, who is an excellent\ncreature--who sympathizes with me, and helps me.\" She stopped, and lifted\nher head inquiringly. \"Where _is_ the servant?\" she asked.\n\nI had forgotten the woman who had brought her into the room. She must\nhave delicately left us together after leading Lucilla in. When I looked\nup, she was not to be seen.\n\n\"The servant is no doubt waiting down-stairs,\" I said. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"But for that good creature,\" Lucilla resumed, \"I should never have got\nhere. She brought me your letter, and read it to me, and wrote my reply.\nI arranged with her to slip out at the first opportunity. One chance was\nin our favor--we had only the cousin to keep an eye on us. Oscar was not\nin the house.\"\n\nShe suddenly checked herself at the last word. A slight sound at the\nlower end of the room, which had passed unnoticed by me, had caught her\ndelicate ear, \"What is that noise?\" she asked. \"Anybody in the room with\nus?\"\n\nI looked up once more. While she was talking of the false Oscar, the true\nOscar was standing listening to her, at the other end of the room.\n\nWhen he discovered that I was looking at him, he entreated me by a\ngesture not to betray his presence. He had evidently heard what we had\nbeen saying to each other, before I detected him--for he touched his\neyes, and lifted his hands pityingly in allusion to Lucilla's blindness.\nWhatever his mood might be, that melancholy discovery must surely have\naffected him--Lucilla's influence over him now, _could_ only be an\ninfluence for good. I signed to him to remain--and told Lucilla that\nthere was nothing to be alarmed about. She went on.\n\n\"Oscar left us for London early this morning,\" she said. \"Can you guess\nwhat he has gone for? He has gone to get the Marriage License--he has\ngiven notice of the marriage at the church. My last hope is in you. In\nspite of everything that I can say to him, he has fixed the day for the\ntwenty-first--in two days more! I have done all I could to put it off; I\nhave insisted on every possible delay. Oh, if you knew----!\" Her rising\nagitation stifled her utterance at the moment. \"I mustn't waste the\nprecious minutes; I must get back before Oscar returns,\" she went on,\nrallying again. \"Oh, my old friend, you are never at a loss; you always\nknow what to do! Find me some way of putting off my marriage. Suggest\nsomething which will take them by surprise, and force them to give me\ntime!\"\n\nI looked towards the lower end of the room. Listening in breathless\ninterest, Oscar had noiselessly advanced half-way towards us. At a sign\nfrom me, he checked himself and came no farther.\n\n\"Do you really mean, Lucilla, that you no longer love him?\" I said.\n\n\"I can tell you nothing about it,\" she answered--\"except that some\ndreadful change has come over me. While I had my sight, I could partly\naccount for it--I believed that the new sense had made a new being of me.\nBut now I have lost my sight again--now I am once more what I have been\nall my life--still the same horrible insensibility possesses me. I have\nso little feeling for him, that I sometimes find it hard to persuade\nmyself that he really _is_ Oscar. You know how I used to adore him. You\nknow how enchanted I should once have been to marry him. Think of what I\nmust suffer, feeling towards him as I feel now!\"\n\nI looked up again. Oscar had stolen nearer; I could see his face plainly.\nThe good influence of Lucilla was beginning to do its good work! I saw\nthe tears rising in his eyes; I saw love and pity taking the place of\nhatred and revenge. The Oscar of my old recollections was standing before\nme once more!\n\n\"I don't want to go away,\" Lucilla went on; \"I don't want to leave him.\nAll I ask for, is a little more time. Time _must_ help me to get back\nagain to my old self. My blind days have been the days of my whole life.\nCan a few weeks of sight have deprived me of the feelings which have been\ngrowing in me for years? I won't believe it! I can find my way about the\nhouse; I can tell things by my touch; I can do all that I did in my\nblindness, just as well as ever, now I am blind again. The feeling for\n_him_ will come back to me like the rest. Only give me time! only give me\ntime!\"\n\nAt the last word, she started to her feet in sudden alarm. \"There is some\none in the room,\" she said. \"Some one who is crying! Who is it?\"\n\nOscar was close to us. The tears were falling fast over his cheeks--the\none faint sobbing breath which had escaped him had caught my ear as well\nas Lucilla's. I took his hand in one of my hands; and I took Lucilla's\nhand in the other. For good or for evil, the result rested with God's\nmercy. The time had come.\n\n\"Who is it?\" Lucilla repeated impatiently.\n\n\"Try if you can tell, my love, without asking me.\"\n\nWith those words, I put her hand in Oscar's hand--and stood close,\nwatching her face.\n\nFor one awful moment, when she first felt the familiar touch, the blood\nleft her cheeks. Her blind eyes dilated fearfully. She stood petrified.\nThen, with a long low cry--a cry of breathless rapture--she flung her\narms passionately round his neck. The life flowed back into her face; her\nlovely smile just trembled on her parted lips; her breath came faint and\nquick and fluttering. In soft tones of ecstasy, with her lips on his\ncheek, she murmured the delicious words:\n\n\"Oh, Oscar! I know you once more!\"\n\n\n\nCHAPTER THE FIFTIETH\n\nThe End of the Journey\n\nA LITTLE interval of time elapsed.\n\nHer first exquisite sense of the recognition by touch had passed away.\nHer mind had recovered its balance. She separated herself from Oscar, and\nturned to me, with the one inevitable question which I knew must follow\nthe joining of their hands.\n\n\"What does it mean?\"\n\nThe exposure of Nugent's perfidy; the revelation of the fatal secret of\nOscar's face; and, last not least, the defence of my own conduct towards\nher, were all comprehended in the answer for which that question called.\nAs carefully, as delicately, as mercifully as I could, I disclosed to her\nthe whole truth. How the shock affected her, she did not tell me at the\ntime, and has never told me since. With her hand in Oscar's hand, with\nher face hidden on Oscar's breast, she listened; not once interrupting\nme, from first to last, by so much as a single word. Now and then, I saw\nher tremble; now and then I heard her sigh heavily. That was all. It was\nonly when I had ended--it was only after a long interval during which\nOscar and I watched her in speechless anxiety--that she slowly lifted her\nhead and broke the silence.\n\n\"Thank God,\" we heard her say to herself fervently--\"Thank God, I am\nblind.\"\n\nThose were her first words. They filled me with horror. I cried out to\nher to recall them.\n\nShe quietly laid her head back on Oscar's breast.\n\n\"Why should I recall them?\" she asked. \"Do you think I wish to see him\ndisfigured as he is now? No! I wish to see him--and I _do_ see him!--as\nmy fancy drew his picture in the first days of our love. My blindness is\nmy blessing. It has given me back my old delightful sensation when I\ntouch him; it keeps my own beloved image of him--the one image I care\nfor--unchanged and unchangeable. You _will_ persist in thinking that my\nhappiness depends on my sight. I look back with horror at what I suffered\nwhen I had my sight--my one effort is to forget that miserable time. Oh,\nhow little you know of me! Oh, what a shock it would be to me, if I saw\nhim as you see him! Try to understand me, and you won't talk of my\nloss--you will talk of my gain.\"\n\n\"Your gain?\" I repeated. \"What have you gained?\"\n\n\"Happiness,\" she answered. \"My life lives in my love. And my love lives\nin my blindness.\"\n\nThere was the story of her whole existence--told in two words!\n\nIf you had seen her radiant face as she raised it again in the excitement\nof speaking; if you had remembered (as I remembered) what her surgeon had\nsaid of the penalty which she must inevitably pay for the recovery of her\nsight--how would you have answered her? It is barely possible, perhaps,\nthat you might have done what I did. That is to say: You might have\nmodestly admitted that she knew what the conditions of her happiness were\nbetter than you--and you might not have answered her at all!\n\nI left them to talk together, and took a turn in the room, considering\nwith myself what we were to do next.\n\nIt was not easy to say. The barren information which I had received from\nmy darling was all the information that I possessed. Nugent had\nunflinchingly carried his cruel deception to its end. He had falsely\ngiven notice of his marriage at the church, in his brother's name; and he\nwas now in London, falsely obtaining his Marriage License, in his\nbrother's name also. So much I knew of his proceedings--and no more.\n\nWhile I was still pondering, Lucilla cut the Gordian knot.\n\n\"Why are we stopping here?\" she asked. \"Let us go--and never return to\nthis hateful place again!\"\n\nAs she rose to her feet, we were startled by a soft knock at the door.\n\nI answered the knock. The woman who had brought Lucilla to the hotel\nappeared once more. She seemed to be afraid to venture far from the door.\nStanding just inside the room, she looked nervously at Lucilla, and said,\n\"Can I speak to you, Miss?\"\n\n\"You can say anything you like, before this lady and gentleman,\" Lucilla\nanswered. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"I'm afraid we have been followed, Miss.\"\n\n\"Followed? By whom?\"\n\n\"By the lady's maid. I saw her, a little while since, looking up at the\nhotel--and then she went back in a hurry on the way to the house--and\nthat's not the worse of it, Miss.\"\n\n\"What else has happened?\"\n\n\"We have made a mistake about the railway,\" said the woman. \"There's a\ntrain from London that we didn't notice in the timetable. They tell me\ndown-stairs it came in more than a quarter of an hour ago. Please to come\nback, Miss--or I fear we shall be found out.\"\n\n\"You can go back at once, Jane,\" said Lucilla.\n\n\"By myself?\"\n\n\"Yes. Thank you for bringing me here--here I remain.\"\n\nShe had barely taken her seat again between Oscar and me, before the door\nwas softly opened from the outside. A long thin nervous hand stole in\nthrough the opening; took the servant by the arm; and drew her out into\nthe passage. In her place, a man entered the room with his hat on. The\nman was Nugent Dubourg.\n\nHe stopped where the servant had stopped. He looked at Lucilla; he looked\nat his brother; he looked at me.\n\nNot a word fell from him. There he stood, fronting the friend whom he had\ncalumniated and the brother whom he had betrayed. There he stood--with\nhis eyes fixed on Lucilla, sitting between us--knowing that it was all\nover; knowing that the woman for whom he had degraded himself, was a\nwoman parted from him for ever. There he stood, in the hell of his own\nmaking--and devoured his torture in silence.\n\nOn his brother's appearance, Oscar had risen, and had raised Lucilla with\nhim. He now advanced a step towards Nugent, still holding to him his\nbetrothed wife.\n\nI followed them, eagerly watching his face. There was no fear in me now\nof what he might do. Lucilla's blessed influence had found, and cast out,\nthe lurking demon that had been hidden in him. With a mind attentive but\nnot alarmed, I waited to see how he would meet the emergency that\nconfronted him.\n\n\"Nugent!\" he said, very quietly.\n\nNugent's head drooped--he made no answer.\n\nLucilla, hearing Oscar pronounce the name, instantly understood what had\nhappened. She shuddered with horror. Oscar gently placed her in my arms,\nand advanced again alone towards his brother. His face expressed the\nstruggle in him of some subtly-mingling influences of love and anguish,\nof sorrow and shame. He recalled to me in the strangest manner my past\nexperience of him, when he had first trusted me with the story of the\nTrial, and when he had told me that Nugent was the good angel of his\nlife.\n\nHe went up to the place at which his brother was standing. In the simple,\nboyish way, so familiar to me in the bygone time, he laid his hand on his\nbrother's arm.\n\n\"Nugent!\" he said. \"Are you the same dear good brother who saved me from\ndying on the scaffold, and who cheered my hard life afterwards? Are you\nthe same bright, clever, noble fellow that I was always so fond of, and\nso proud of?\"\n\nHe paused, and removed his brother's hat. With careful, caressing hand,\nhe parted his brother's ruffled hair over the forehead. Nugent's head\nsank lower. His face was distorted, his hands were clenched, in the dumb\nagony of remembrance which that tender voice and that kind hand had set\nloose in him. Oscar gave him time to recover himself: Oscar spoke next to\nme.\n\n\"You know Nugent,\" he said. \"You remember when we first met, my telling\nyou that Nugent was an angel? You saw for yourself, when he came to\nDimchurch, how kindly he helped me; how faithfully he kept my secrets;\nwhat a true friend he was. Look at him--and you will feel, as I do, that\nwe have misunderstood and misinterpreted him, in some monstrous way.\" He\nturned again to Nugent. \"I daren't tell you,\" he went on, \"what I have\nheard about you, and what I have believed about you, and what vile\nunbrotherly thoughts I have had of being revenged on you. Thank God, they\nare gone! My dear fellow, I look back at them--now I see you--as I might\nlook back at a horrible dream. How _can_ I see you, Nugent, and believe\nthat you have been false to me? You, a villain who has tried to rob poor\nMe of the only woman in the world who cares for me! You, so handsome and\nso popular, who may marry any woman you like! It can't be. You have\ndrifted innocently into some false position without knowing it. Defend\nyourself. No. Let me defend you. You shan't humble yourself to anybody.\nTell me how you have really acted towards Lucilla, and towards me--and\nleave it to your brother to set you right with everybody. Come, Nugent!\nlift up your head--and tell me what I shall say.\"\n\nNugent lifted his head, and looked at Oscar.\n\nGhastly as his face was, I saw something in his eyes, when he first fixed\nthem on his brother, which again reminded me of past days--the days when\nhe had joined us at Dimchurch, and when he used to talk of \"poor Oscar\"\nin the tender, light-hearted way that first won me. I thought once more\nof the memorable night-interview between us at Browndown, when Oscar had\nleft England. Again, I called to mind the signs which had told of the\nnobler nature of the man pleading with him. Again, I remembered the\nremorse which had moved him to tears--the effort he had made in my\npresence to atone for past misdoing, and to struggle for the last time\nagainst the guilty passion that possessed him. Was the nature which could\nfeel that remorse utterly depraved? Was the man who had made that\neffort--the last of many that had gone before it--irredeemably bad?\n\n\"Wait!\" I whispered to Lucilla, trembling and weeping in my arms. \"He\nwill deserve our sympathy; he will win our pardon and our pity yet!\"\n\n\"Come!\" Oscar repeated. \"Tell me what I shall say.\"\n\nNugent drew from his pocket a sheet of paper with writing on it.\n\n\"Say,\" he answered, \"that I gave notice of your marriage at the church\nhere-and that I went to London and got you _this._\"\n\nHe handed the sheet of paper to his brother. It was the Marriage License,\ntaken out in his brother's name.\n\n\"Be happy, Oscar,\" he added. \"_You_ deserve it.\"\n\nHe threw one arm in his old easy protecting way round his brother. His\nhand, as he did this, touched the breast-pocket of Oscar's coat. Before\nit was possible to stop him, his dexterous fingers had opened the pocket,\nand had taken from it a little toy-pistol with a chased silver handle of\nOscar's own workmanship.\n\n\"Was this for me?\" he asked, with a faint smile. \"My poor boy! you could\nnever have done it, could you?\" He kissed Oscar's dark cheek, and put the\npistol into his own pocket. \"The handle is your work,\" he said. \"I shall\ntake it as your present to me. Return to Browndown when you are married.\nI am going to travel again. You shall hear from me before I leave\nEngland. God bless you, Oscar. Good-bye.\"\n\nHe put his brother back from him with a firm and gentle hand. I attempted\nto advance with Lucilla, and speak to him. Something in his face--looking\nat me out of his mournful eyes, calm, stern, and superhuman, like a look\nof doom--warned me back from him, and filled me with the foreboding that\nI should see him no more. He walked to the door, and opened\nit--turned--and, fixing his farewell look on Lucilla, saluted us silently\nwith a bend of his head. The door closed on him softly. In a few minutes\nonly from the time when he had entered the room, he had left us\nagain--and left us for ever.\n\nWe waited, spell-bound--we could not speak. The void that he left behind\nhim was dreary and dreadful. I was the first who moved. In silence, I led\nLucilla back to our seat on the sofa, and beckoned to Oscar to go to her\nin my place.\n\nThis done, I left them--and went out to meet Lucilla's father, on his\nreturn to the hotel. I wished to prevent him from disturbing them. After\nwhat had happened, it was good for those two to be alone.\n\n\n\nEPILOGUE\n\nMadame Pratolungo's Last Words\n\nTWELVE years have passed since the events occurred which it has been the\nbusiness of these pages to relate. I am at my desk; looking idly at all\nthe leaves of writing which my pen has filled, and asking myself if there\nis more yet to add, before I have done.\n\nThere is more--not much.\n\nOscar and Lucilla claim me first. Two days after they were restored to\neach other at Sydenham, they were married at the church in that place. It\nwas a dull wedding. Nobody was in spirits but Mr. Finch. We parted in\nLondon. The bride and bridegroom returned to Browndown. The rector\nremained in town for a day or two visiting some friends. I went back to\nmy father, to accompany him, as I had promised, on his journey from\nMarseilles to Paris.\n\nAs well as I remember, I remained a fortnight abroad. In the course of\nthat time, I received kind letters from Browndown. One of them announced\nthat Oscar had heard from his brother.\n\nNugent's letter was not a long one. It was dated at Liverpool, and it\nannounced his embarkation for America in two hours' time. He had heard of\na new expedition to the Arctic regions--then fitting out in the United\nStates--with the object of discovering the open Polar sea, supposed to be\nsituated between Spitzbergen and Nova Zembla. It had instantly struck him\nthat this expedition offered an entirely new field of study to a\nlandscape painter in search of the sublimest aspects of Nature. He had\ndecided on volunteering to join the Arctic explorers--and he had already\nraised the necessary money for his outfit by the sale of the only\nvaluables he possessed--his jewelry and his books. If he wanted more, he\nengaged to apply to Oscar. In any case, he promised to write again,\nbefore the expedition sailed. And so, for the present only, he would bid\nhis brother and sister affectionately farewell.--When I afterwards looked\nat the letter myself, I found nothing in it which referred in the\nslightest degree to the past, or which hinted at the state of the\nwriter's own health and spirits.\n\nI returned to our remote Southdown village; and occupied the room which\nLucilla had herself prepared for me at Browndown.\n\nI found the married pair as tranquil and as happy in their union as a man\nand woman could be. The absent Nugent dwelt a little sadly in their minds\nat times, I suspect, as well as in mine. It was perhaps on this account,\nthat Lucilla appeared to me to be quieter than she used to be in her\nmaiden days. However, my presence did something towards restoring her to\nher old spirits--and Grosse's speedy arrival exerted its enlivening\ninfluence in support of mine.\n\nAs soon as the gout would let him get on his feet, he presented himself\nwith his instruments, at Browndown, eager for another experiment on\nLucilla's eyes.\n\n\"If my operations had failed,\" he said, \"I should not have plagued you no\nmore. But my operations has not failed: it is you who have failed to take\ncare of your nice new eyes when I gave them to you.\"\n\nIn those terms he endeavored to persuade her to let him attempt another\noperation. She steadily refused to submit to it--and the discussion that\nfollowed roused her famously.\n\nMore than once afterwards Grosse tried to make her change her mind. He\ntried in vain. The disputes between the two made the house ring again.\nLucilla found all her old gaiety, in refuting the grotesque arguments and\npersuasions of our worthy German. To me--when I once or twice attempted\nto shake her resolution--she replied in another way, merely repeating the\nwords she had said to me at Sydenham: \"My life lives in my love. And my\nlove lives in my blindness.\" It is only right to add that Mr. Sebright,\nand another competent authority consulted with him, declared\nunhesitatingly that she was right. Under the circumstances, Mr. Sebright\nwas of opinion that the success of Grosse's operation could never have\nbeen more than temporary. His colleague, after examining Lucilla's eyes,\nat a later period, entirely agreed with him. Which was in the\nright--these two or Grosse--who can say? As blind Lucilla, you first knew\nher. As blind Lucilla, you see the last of her now. If you feel inclined\nto regret this, remember that the one thing essential was the thing she\npossessed. Her life was a happy one. Bear this in mind--and don't forget\nthat your conditions of happiness need not necessarily be her conditions\nalso.\n\nIn the time I am now writing of, the second letter from Nugent arrived.\nIt was written the evening before he sailed for the Polar seas. One line\nin it touched us deeply. \"Who knows whether I shall ever see England\nagain! If a boy is born to you, Oscar, call him by my name--for my sake.\"\n\nEnclosed in this letter was a private communication from Nugent,\naddressed to me. It was the confession to which I have alluded in my\nnotes attached to Lucilla's Journal. These words only were added at the\nend: \"You now know everything. Forgive me--if you can. I have not escaped\nwithout suffering; remember that.\" After making use of the narrative, as\nyou already know, I have burnt it all, except those last lines.\n\nAt distant intervals, we heard twice of the exploring ship, from whaling\nvessels. Then, there was a long dreary interval, without news of any\nsort. Then, a dreadful report that the expedition was lost. Then, the\nconfirmation of the report--a lapse of a whole year, and no tidings of\nthe missing men.\n\nThey were well provided with supplies of all kinds; and there was a\ngeneral hope that they might be holding out. A new expedition was\nsent--and sent vainly--in search of them overland. Rewards were offered\nto whaling vessels to find them, and were never earned. We wore mourning\nfor Nugent; we were a melancholy household. Two more years passed--before\nthe fate of the expedition was discovered. A ship in the whale trade,\ndriven out of her course, fell in with a wrecked and dismantled vessel,\nlost in the ice. Let the last sentences of the captain's report tell the\nstory.\n\n\"The wreck was drifting along a channel of open water, when we first\nsaw it. Before long, it was brought up by an iceberg. I got into my boat\nwith some of my sailors, and we rowed to the vessel.\n\n\"Not a man was to be seen on the deck, which was covered with snow. We\nhailed, and got no reply. I looked in through one of the circular glazed\nport-holes astern, and saw dimly the figure of a man seated at a table. I\nknocked on the thick glass, but he never moved. We got on deck, and\nopened the cabin hatchway, and went below. The man I had seen was before\nus, at the end of the cabin. I led the way, and spoke to him. He made no\nanswer. I looked closer, and touched one of his hands which lay on the\ntable. To my horror and astonishment, he was a frozen corpse.\n\n\"On the table before him was the last entry in the ship's log!\n\n\"'Seventeen days since we have been shut up in the ice: Our fire went\nout yesterday. The captain tried to light it again, and has failed. The\nsurgeon and two seamen died of cold this morning. The rest of us must\nsoon follow. If we are ever discovered, I beg the person who finds me to\nsend this----'\n\n\"There the hand that held the pen had dropped into the writer's lap. The\nleft hand still lay on the table. Between the frozen fingers, we found a\nlong lock of a woman's hair, tied at each end with a blue ribbon. The\nopen eyes of the corpse were still fixed on the lock of hair.\n\n\"The name of this man was found in his pocket-book. It was Nugent\nDubourg. I publish the name in my report, in case it may meet the eyes of\nhis friends.\n\n\"Examination of the rest of the vessel, and comparison of dates with the\ndate of the log-book, showed that the officers and crew had been dead for\nmore than two years. The positions in which we found the frozen men, and\nthe names, where it was possible to discover them, are here set forth as\nfollows.\"...\n\n\nThat \"lock of a woman's hair\" is now in Lucilla's possession. It will be\nburied with her, at her own request, when she dies. Ah, poor Nugent! Are\nwe not all sinners? Remember the best of him, and forget the worst, as I\ndo.\n\nI still linger over my writing--reluctant to leave it, if the truth must\nbe told. But what more is there to say? I hear Oscar hammering away at\nhis chasing, and whistling blithely over his work. In another room,\nLucilla is teaching the piano to her little girl. On my table is a letter\nfrom Mrs. Finch, dated from one of our distant colonies--over which Mr.\nFinch (who has risen gloriously in the world) presides pastorally as\nbishop. He harangues the \"natives\" to his heart's content: and the\nwonderful natives like it. \"Jicks\" is in her element among the aboriginal\nmembers of her father's congregation: there are fears that the wandering\nArab of the Finch family will end in marrying \"a chief.\" Mrs. Finch--I\ndon't expect you to believe this--is anticipating another confinement.\nLucilla's eldest boy--called Nugent--has just come in, and stands by my\ndesk. He lifts his bright blue eyes up to mine; his round rosy face\nexpresses strong disapproval of what I am doing. \"Aunty,\" he says, \"you\nhave written enough. Come and play.\"\n\nThe boy is right. I must put away my manuscript and leave you. My\nexcellent spirits are a little dashed at parting. I wonder whether you\nare sorry too? I shall never know! Well, I have many blessings to comfort\nme, on closing my relations with you. I have kind souls who love me;\nand--observe this!--I stand on my political principles as firmly as ever.\nThe world is getting converted to my way of thinking: the Pratolungo\nprogramme, my friends, is coming to the front with giant steps. Long live\nthe Republic! Farewell.\n\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Poor Miss Finch, by Wilkie Collins\n\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK POOR MISS FINCH ***\n\n***** This file should be named 3632-8.txt or 3632-8.zip *****\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n        http:\/\/www.gutenberg.org\/3\/6\/3\/3632\/\n\nProduced by James Rusk\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\nwill be renamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http:\/\/www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp:\/\/pglaf.org\/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http:\/\/pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http:\/\/pglaf.org\/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http:\/\/www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n","id":1057,"split":"train"}
